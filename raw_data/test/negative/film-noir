this formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. the plot could have been tightened. high points of the film: seeing "tennessee" ernie ford without a mustache singing "man in the saddle"; alfonso bedoya's too brief scenes as a cook; the color photography of the high country, and the fight scene there with john russell.

by randolph scott standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointing and heavy-handed star western. two or three of the characters could be dispensed with, while two or three other characters could be given more prominence. (the humour needs to be completely rewritten.) de toth handles the action well - as always - but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak.

over the gw is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it's not without trying...actually, it is. it's a shamble all the more because it's writer/director/technical everyman nick gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story. gaglia, who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their "patients" with crazy group scare tactics, psychological mind-f*** sessions that could go on for days, and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most nazis cringe, escaped finally when he was 15. i'm glad he got out, though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film-making skills, if only for a couple of days, to learn things like, say, structure, proper lighting, fluid camera movement, subtlety with actors, and other basics that are perpetually lost here.it's all the more frustrating because gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public (there was recently a newsweek article referring to a similar aa cult-rehab). many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas. this is an ever-nagging sensation throughout over the gw, where it almost feels like gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn't know how to communicate it properly through his characters. the character that one would think is closest to him, bronx teen tony serra (gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a rehab in new jersey, would be closest to gaglia, is actually much more of a one-dimensional being, where there is very little back-story (we see a brief freak-out, in black and white, in his old home) and little connection to his mother (moriarty), who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another. but there is a story to go with his two-year crisis, i guess.right off the bat things get rough (a nude cavity search in the first five minutes), and soon it's clear that instead of medical care it's more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect, where the head doctor hiller (insinnia) is a total over-controlling loon. but soon tony's sister sofia (donohue) gets thrown in to the program, and as opposed to tony's repeated moments of outrage and supposed non-compliance, she goes head-on through the whacked-out three step program and once released becoming a runaway. at times there are bits in this fractured nightmare, where there's one woman, a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she's become a prisoner not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to hiller when sofia finally returns to them, that do contain some raw power, very brief glimpses of gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama.but these are moments few and far between. it's not just the unsuccessful characters, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical d.a.r.e. rip-offs (maybe some of them, like an angry black youth, the passive-aggressive counselors, or even serra's older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program, would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them). it's that gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny $30,000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through. he over-uses tints, mostly with a shade that looks urine-coated), he jiggles his hand-held dvx camera as if it's supposed to be intense ala city of god, occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly, his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there's even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas serra (inspiration ?) and krakowsky that feel about as false as possible.could gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would-be artistically cathartic plan b? bottom line, no matter how much from-the-heart true life stories may appeal to you, don't bother seeing it in the theater, or even on rental, unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital-hued hudson river sunset with the final words reading: dedicated to the kids. oy.

the characterization in this movie is among the worst i've ever encountered. the dialogue is trite and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction. none of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. also, the depiction of the chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--i find it hard to believe that the chinese father learns flawless english from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. etc.the smile train is a great organization and it's a nice idea, to make a heartstring-tugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids' lives, but overall, i found this movie to be more frustrating than anything.

the story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered "valley girl" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives. what a great and worthy story line. but in this telling the screen writing and/or directing and/or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story. linda hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet, and for what purpose? conflict, conflict, conflict, at the drop of a hat. katie (the california girl) and her boyfriend, katie's mom and everybody, including the poor lady at the airport check-in counter, lin's adopted father, who is the nicest, most considerate man alive, and his wife and biological son, all in constant conflict. i really wanted to enjoy a heartwarming story, but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hate and fighting were over. there were too many unexplained or illogical events, many of which don't add to the story. my wife and i kept looking at each other and asking ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great story, could be crapped up so badly.

...without anything to walk away with. this movie starts with scenes in china with the finding of a newborn. while this is not a new concept, i wasn't going to give up right there. then there is a flash forward to adolescence. the man's wife and biological child are fed up with the father who has neglected them. while this did not seem culturally accurate, and the movie made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the adopted father's devotion, i pressed on.next, we're in malibu where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low-budget (fill in the blank: acting/camera work/lighting).i won't give away any more of the plot, because i suppose the synopsis is accurate: the movie is meant to show how a malibu girl who (though she seems to innately have the compassion and interest to help others when she immediately asks her teacher about the trip to china) is spoiled and inconsiderate, finds herself as being a healer and helper of both body and spirit.lame. lame, lame, lame.now i, admittedly, am a harsh critic, so maybe take one of those lame's away and you'll be on the mark.

two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist. however, the script, the direction, and some scenes, were just awful. i kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. my only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie, but knew the movie was filled with flaws.this film could have been so much better, and reached a larger audience accordingly. what makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film, some scenes being painfully bad to watch, i still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself.

the pace of this movie is quite slow. it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. nothing surprises you. i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:katie - a beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn't everything. she realizes that she can "feel" and "see the real world". touching.the mother - high strung, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) that need taking care of by a strong man.the father - patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman.the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants.the comedian clown chinese guy that doesn't know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock. thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties.the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother i.e. a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything.the deformed chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl. because in china (a third world country according to the film) don't have anything and hence needs our charity. gah, wake up and smell what you are shoveling.sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries (read usa) is so shallow and happy ending-ish that it is sad and revolting. shanghai (where the movie is set) is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment.the chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ...the teacher (sean astin) that has this really heart ripping story (not) that he tells without feel. why sean? why!?etc etc. it is difficult to actually finding a "real" person in the entire movie.this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15. if you want to learn anything about the world watch e.g. hotel rwanda instead. for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian "cinema paradiso" that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back.the only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some (not all) of the beautiful chinese country side. i have been there and seen some of it.

i do not like himesh reshamiya. i do not like his singing too. but his songs are a craze in india, especially among commoners. now when he ventured to become an actor ¬ñ that was a big joke! what guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. i did never want to see this movie. but one thing changed it. the movie becoming a super-duper hit! after 2 weeks, aap ka saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores ¬ñ compared to apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. if i can sit through apne and rajnikant's absurd sivaji ¬ñ i should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit? the story is about the real life singer himesh reshamiya (hr) who has gone to germany for a concert and falls in love with riya (hansika motwani). a german lawyer ruby (mallika sherawat) loves himesh. now himesh is arrested for a murder. the mission of himesh (in last 40 minutes) after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer.let me say that himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. he tries hard but fails miserably. he is pathetic. i was thinking what could have made the movie click so much? let me find something positive.first, the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point himesh runs away from the jail. (but after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits) second, the songs of the movie are good, catchy, crowd puller numbers. third, mallika sherawat ¬ñ she looks gorgeous and acts well too, as the second lady. i can imagine fans of mallika coming to see the movie just for her. fourth, the cinematography of the movie is pleasing ¬ñ especially the german locales, are a treat to watch for the eye. fifth, the major portion of the story is a love story between himesh and riya ¬ñ with clich√©d dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd. sixth, the director prashant chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of himesh as much as possible with shots that don't need himesh to act much.the heroine hansika motwani looks like a small budget film heroine. raj babbar is wasted in a small role. overall the movie is a below average.i was thinking throughout the movie ¬ñ what if the same movie script was done with salmaan as the main lead. i think it would have had been a much better affair. may be then i would have given the movie 6 out of 10. but now¬Ö (stars 4.5 out of 10)

this movie has to be the worst film of 2007, it was just really bad and i don't think i have ever seen a film that is just so bad, i mean the don't make really bad hollywood films do they?? hamish really should stick to singing instead of acting cause he just can't act at all, god he was just so bad, i mean he was that bad in the film that he made mallika sherawat look like a better actress than him, as for her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it is just so boring watching her, i mean what do men see in this woman?, yeah she has a god body but where is that talent???? i have not seen it yet and at this rate i don't think that i ever will.anyway hamish falls in love with ria now this 15 year old girl can act, my god she was the best actor in the film and she does not look 15 at all, to me she looks about 21, but her performance was brilliant in the film. bless her she was really good, i hope to see more of her in the future. so ria falls in love with himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else, a typical bollywood film anyways there is a hiccup (can only happen in a bollywood film) and the both get married in the end.well i would give th music 10/10 it was superb, that made the movie a hit, the songs were truly amazing and brilliant. anyways the only thing that i can say is to go and buy the music and not watch the film.

( hr is what himesh is called in the movie, i think he likes it too. ) it's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.i really like reshamiya. it's amazing what he has done. no one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.and i truly expected a great film ( what with the budget of 50 cr and the cute actress ). as intense as reshamiya is i thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. ironically he is depicted the same but for what care? sheer incompetence, carelessness, awful acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain.blunders rule. ( ex. how can german police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in english? they communicate among themselves in english!) unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line bollywood. there are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too. the worse thing is that the majority just doesn't care.songs are the only saving grace...please don't repeat this hr and find yourself a good director ( low budget.. no problem).the villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know... after all it's a 50cr movie.

as a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: in was in mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, i was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.while i speak german as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in english, otherwise it would be too confusing for the indian audience... so therefore, all germans in this movie actually speak english! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-indian characters are only done by 4 voices! . . . .

there is nothing like an oscar wilde comedy, and this movie is nothing like a comedy. the melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent. in the original story, the humor comes from the americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of canterville chase. the american father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the creaking chains. read the book!

the canterville ghost (1996).the director made this too sappy a production. maybe it's the generation, but i really liked the charles laughton version. there is a time and place for "emoting" and this production does not translate very well. patrick stewart, reciting shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. would neither recommend nor watch again. the close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work. the screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue. check out the really good version and pass on this one.

this film's premise seems to be that the passing of the world war 2 generation in america, with its apple-pie phoniness and hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. those awful hippies ruined everything apparently.what holds the film together are the excellent performances - particularly lemmon's which is truly remarkable. otherwise we have a boring slice-of-life drama (just over 24 hours of jack's life) with pretensions.i found it a chore to sit through.

jack lemmon was one of our great actors. his performances in days of wine and roses, the apartment, some like it hot, missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of best actor nomination. his only win was for save the tiger, and that's a shame. he gets melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. he actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note glengarry glen ross. as for the movie, wonderful supporting work by jack gilford as lemmon's partner and thayer david as an arsonist, go for naught because the rest of the script is a muddled jumble of cliched vignettes, angst, neurotic nostalgia, and pointless moralizing. worth seeing once as a time capsule into 1970's style experimental direction by avildsen.

jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen. he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. while his performance in "save the tiger" is oscar-worthy, i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one.this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member. it's too bad the screenwriter's output didn't match that of lemmon's. don't waste your time with this one.

this is the first woody allen film i've found not worth watching. i think woody has tried many different genres to interest results but this movie just left me irritated and bored. the music is lovely but don't bother watching this hopeless mock-umentary.

this film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.i was expecting the usual woody allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but "sweet and lowdown" failed to provide any. the main character, emmet ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. he is so unlikeable, that i do not want to now about him, or care about him. i wonder why a film about him has to be made. the pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore. even sean penn's great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable level.i like woody allen's films a lot, but "sweet and lowdown" is a major disappointment.

wow, did this episode start on a stooooopid premise! the enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, abraham lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the enterprise!!!!!!! is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. it seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy. the whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair, as the good side is saddled with surak--a vulcan who makes gandhi seem like rambo!! despite a totally awful premise, the action is pretty good and it's great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match. but, don't mistake this for high art or deep sci-fi. the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first-run series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise.

believe it or not, this was at one time the worst movie i had ever seen. since that time, i have seen many more movies that are worse (how is it possible??) therefore, to be fair, i had to give this movie a 2 out of 10. but it was a tough call.

pointless movie about making a movie. no where near the flesh shown in the original, which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music. not here.it's always fun seeing the pathmark guy though.

the '80's were the best of times and worst of times for james karin, he starred in one of the best cult horror-comedies with "return of the living dead" and a year later he acts in this piece of.... this bad movie. a sequel to hardbodies (but not really), has a group of fairly unlikeable characters attempting to make a movie in greece. through design or sheer laziness the line between the film and the 'film within a film' is not only blurred, but throughly non-existent from scene to scene (which would be confusing if i were just interested in anything happening in the movie in the first place. unfunny would be too generous a term.eye candy: nana, fabiana udenio, and many numerous extras get topless; brenda bakke shows some t&amy grade: fdvd extras: just trailers for "hardbodies", "american high school", "strike", "virgin territory" (comes in a double-feature dvd with the first film, for the masochistic)

it's just when a band tours, and only has one original member. it's not the same as the classic line up. all new actors playing the main roles of rag, scotty, etc, with ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. and he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. the film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of armageddon. even for a t&a movie, this one is a turkey. not even die hard low budget 80's films fans would want to sit through this movie, which has no plot, and plenty of bad acting. this film would have been better off never being released. just plain bad.

this film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly - although fairly popular - slapstick californian beach comedy called hardbodies, but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right. it is certainly better than hardbodies i, and is more closely related to films such as venus and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands. the combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing, but (except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday) even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes. venus was underpinned by the legend of the re-incarnation of the goddess, and summer lovers had the viability of a "menage a trois" as its theme. in my view both these films were much more successful than hardbodies ii which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semi-slapstick comedy. the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious, it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line. mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and hardbodies ii unfortunately does not. there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co-habit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set. the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo-comedy. they are also grossly overlong, so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth. this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned. as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3.	there is little memorable in the acting, but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction - it is in these latter areas that the failure arises.

"hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and plot less. i would add "brainless" to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. the scenery has changed from the california beaches to the greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are sorrells pickard (the bearded guy) and roberta collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with pam grier in "the big doll house"). all the other actors are new, but apparently brad zutaut is supposed to be playing the same character (scotty) as grant cramer did in "hardbodies". this sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie, and doesn't come close to matching it in the "hotness" department, either. of course brenda bakke and fabiana udenio are both very pretty, but the teal roberts - cindy silver - kristi somers team is unbeatable. "hardbodies 2" is not the worst of its kind by any means, but if you only want to see one of these movies, the original is the one to get. (*1/2)

jane eyre with full frontal nudity! i was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful "woman's picture" and i mean that in the worst possible way. the trouble is, it could have been so good if they had only left out the jane eyre stuff and stuck with the vastly more interesting scenes involving the spanish/portuguese jews in early 19th century london. when the sound track music is better than the film, you know you are in trouble. when you fast forward the video because you can't stand the film, just to make sure you don't miss anything, you are in even worse trouble. this film will end up on the romance tv channel where it rightly belongs.

this movie had potential. if it had been handled differently. what it needed was a different director. that's certain. and perhaps a different leading lady. i just can't understand the minnie driver character - or at least how she played it. she was completely unbelievable. i cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. she was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do. i am writing this as i am still watching it. i'm thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to 'act' something i didn't understand. well, we've just proceeded to the affair she begins with the son (i'm still watching). i'm now beginning to be profoundly embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise. if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way, then watch this one.

not good. mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people. some comments : 1. i am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils, never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil, who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds, says something 2. fine, so rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer. but charles is completely different in all aspects from her father - if anything henry is much closer as a sensual, exalted person 3. how could you ever believe that she would be more attracted to tom wilkinson than to rhys meyer. 4. hard to believe, if she had been in fact raised as a deeply religious girl, that she would be so careless about sleeping with a gentile after knowing him for 5 minutes.some good things about the film : at least she didn't end up pregnant, not knowing who the father was... the whole description of life in the jewish community in london is good

first off, i'm a huge bronson fan, have been since the late '70s. i watched every film he made on the big screen since "love and bullets", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, hollywood-blockbuster star.i kept hoping that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good film in the '80s, but that never happened. and i don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio cannon and hack director j. lee thompson for most of his latter films."assasination" gave me some hopes when i saw that peter hunt was directing instead of thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed. first off, the film looks incredibly cheap, like it was made for about 3 mil, minus bronson's inflated salary (i heard he insisted on 5 mil per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his cannon films). the white house scenes were filmed on the va grounds in west la - i was taking the bus when they were shooting. nice job on recreating the white house but did no one think about getting the palm trees out of the shots? guess not.secondly, the supporting cast is really bad. ireland was dying of cancer and despite this she's not bad but the horrible asian woman playing bronson's sidekick was typical of cannon's talent at the time --non-existent. i would be real curious to learn how she got this role. i can't imagine a worse actress for the part, plus she's a good 40 years younger than bronson! the story is not that bad and it's something that bigger and better-budgeted studios did later (eastwood's "in the line of fire" and costner's "bodyguard" film) but the way it's staged here is really sad. i'm wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot. none of it is believable in the slightest. if secret service men really behaved like the keystone cops in this movie we'd have presidents rotating out of office (and out of life) every few months...

i can't believe i sat through this garbage. palm trees in d.c. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit so obviously artificial that i thought it was supposed to be a dummy ... until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous plot. i think it's a shame that jill ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. don't waste your time - i wish i hadn't. the only saving grace is that it was on cable, so i didn't waste my money on top of everything.

bronson and ireland, in their last film together, make a likable pair. he is more restrained than usual and she has become a winning actress. but as a thriller the film is totally worthless. its premise is downright silly and its pace is much too rushed.

in the twilight years of his career, charles bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors, most notably j. lee thompson and michael winner. he did two films for one-time bond director peter hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner death hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like the wilby conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles). bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian, whose assignment is to protect the american president's wife, lara royce craig (jill ireland, real-life wife of bronson). killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins; she thinks he's an over-protective, paranoid pessimist. turns out - surprise, surprise - that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her. the pair of them go on the run, pursued by the assassins. everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady. for some reason, in this film they have renamed her "one mama"! quite what the point of this is is anybody's guess, but it's indicative of the film's pointlessness as a whole. most of the film's performances are lazy, and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where it's going. if i had to label assassination within a specific genre, i'd say it is supposed to be a "thriller". i'd say that with some reservations, however, as to say that it's a thriller it has precious few thrills.

this was the next to last film appearance by jill ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband david mccallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with charles bronson. it is a great irony that bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history.'assassination' seems to be a movie that was tucked into cannon's production schedule for the sake of bronson and ireland. ireland was already suffering from cancer-related illnesses in 1987 and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do 'just one more, for old times' sake.' 'assassination' is carelessly done as a whole, showing the lack of polish and dwindling funds that would tank cannon by 1990. but there's a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is hollywood.bronson plays jay killian, a high-ranking secret service agent who is assigned to protect the first lady, lara craig (ireland). the president's wife has a reputation for being difficult, bossing service agents around and wanting to do things her own way. that all changes, however, when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with killian by car, train, motorbike, and believe it or not, dune buggy to escape would-be assassins. there is little surprise here, as killian believes the murderers are part of an inside job, perhaps arranged by the president himself. on the way, killian and mrs. craig develop an unspoken affection for one another in scenes between bronson and ireland that are actually very funny.what really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how it's still made to look as a dvd. the original trailer gives you the feeling that 'assassination' is another cold-hearted bronson shoot-'em-up. but a lot of this movie - which was rated pg-13, by the way - is in a comic vein, putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like bronson and ireland's western 'from noon till three.' even the dvd case shows bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow things up. which he does, but to a lesser degree than his other '80s potboilers.on the whole, 'assassination' is late cannon slop work and doesn't really know what kind of film it wants to be. besides drifting from actioner to romantic thriller and back again, there are serious mistakes in continuity, property values are bottom-of-the-barrel cheap, and the effects are dreadful; many of the explosions seem like matte work rather than being done on location. robert ragland, who had shown good composing skills in earlier films, teamed up with valentine mccallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better fit for television.richard sale's script has real lulus of dialogue, with the conversations between bronson and ireland the only bright spot. there is no explanation as to why the first lady is called 'one momma' all of a sudden, nor as to why ireland is left with her british accent when the character is a wyoming native. jan gan boyd, playing killian's main assistant, has a kitten-like personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent. stephen elliott (a former tony award nominee who died in may 2005), randy brooks, erik stern (as assassin bracken), and michael ansara (senator bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles.incidentally, this was the last film directing gig for peter hunt, who broke onto the scene with 'on her majesty's secret service' in 1969 and collaborated with bronson and lee marvin on 'death hunt' in 1981. 'assassination' is available on dvd through mgm home entertainment; it is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with three-language subtitles and theatrical trailer.** out of 4

i watched this movie last night, i'm a huge fan of the book, and i was pretty happy with the version in which winona ryder and susan sarandon starred. but this one, it's just awful. oh my god, i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the switching of beth being the younger sister, and making amy the 3rd one. and jo interpretation, terrible, jo was a feminist, intelligent and kinda angry young lady, and the actress portraying jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl. and what's with the laurie going to war?. i'm ok with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made, but not re-write the whole story. very very bad done.

after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie. i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case. first of all let me preface my review with the fact that i love old movies, particularly mysteries and dramas, but not female oriented movies. this probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. i thought the acting was a bit over the top, but that is very common in movies of this era. june allyson was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven. there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments. i hate writing negative reviews, but the movie left me very cold. it has always been my intention to read the book, but after this that seem unlikely. the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister, that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience. again there are others who love this movie, i'm just not one of them.

has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? it makes me think less of a film that does that, showing a definite want of creativity. in all fairness, i tend to be biased in favor of katharine hepburn, but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism. the 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times, and then this version took the script, the music, and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version. i don't understand the point of making the film again when the method of remaking it was to basically redo george cukor's film with everything the same except the people working on it.

it's a long time ago i saw this movie and still it's one of the worst i've ever seen. i like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. not a combination of two. this could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. i didn't want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted to watch it. i didn't know it was such a crap. i loved the first part, in which clooney and tarantino drove through texas, killing everybody on their way (especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at its turning point, in the titty twister bar everything changed. stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'nightmare on elmsteet'. if you like horror, watch a real horror movie. and when you love bloodstolling thrillers don't watch it at all, you will be very disappointed at the end.

this film is simply appalling, how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief.iguess they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea,i feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me.harvey kietel will try and distance himself from this rubbish, it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires.i would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies ,you wont miss a thing.the humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate, movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just depresses you.as deniro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement.

warning:i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.when i first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how rodriguez and tarantino both helped make the film. i began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. first, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where i just wanted to turn it off. i was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on, but i guess i had hopes that it would get better.... then when it finally showed vampires it blew my mind, in a very bad way. i thought,"okay this movie started with some backwash horrible story about these two criminals, then very slowly turned into some vampire movie which i thought it was going to be from the beginning, in like, the last 30 minutes?" to add on to that, they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they're just not; a bunny would've been more intimidating than these characters! this movie is a horrible piece of crap!!! from dusk till dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth, disheartening thoughts in my head, and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that i just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film. i do not understand how george clooney, quentin tarintino, cheech marin and danny trejo, all being the good and honorable actors that they are, could take part in this useless filth. in my opinion, from dusk till dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that i have suffered my eyes on. do not see it, you'll be doing yourelf a great favor...

i love dissing this movie. my peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for quentin tarantino or harvey keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. here's some huge reasons why: a: the plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. b: that untalented juliette lewis is in it. c: preposterous ideas abound such as actual torso-and-leg guitars, brothers with the last name "gecko," bad vampire make-up jobs, cheech marin playing three characters (?), and a crotch-based gun that only fires when "erect" and belongs to a guy who goes by "sex machine." if robert rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence, i might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. the whole project's like he got the ideas by playing with action figures. the only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is george clooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood-sucking, horny-for-children, terrible-acting brother. i swear i think they thought it up right then and there. this movie's out to offend, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. horrible movie.

what could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! the last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! the acting talents of the likes of juliette lewis and harvey keitel (not to mention george clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie. the director... robert rodriguez, known for his other gory flicks including el mariachi, desperado, once upon a time in mexico, and the very recent sin city ... really holds your attention with the well executed first half ... which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time ... but then apparently for no reason, and without any provocation, the madness starts ... there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy ... truly exasperating!!

just what is the point of this film? it starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. the overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. screenplay by tarantino, direction by rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because they did it. but it doesn't quite work that way. you're only good while you continue doing good things. there are so many questions to ask: just what are george clooney and harvey keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy ¬ó utterly ruthless and efficient ¬ó and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. but, of course, we never do. and the clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. that's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). on every level ¬ó except the technical ¬ó this film stinks. avoid.

this was not a good movie!! why do you people keep saying that? there is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then bam vampires!!! why? why are there vampires? where did they come from? also, what the hell?! there are all of these "super human" vampires but george clooney and three other random guys dominate all of them. quickly too. it's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. there was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies! the next thing you know, clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by cheech and leaves the family-less homeless in the middle of mexico. end of story. literally. oh and the strip club was an aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern mexico not the border. why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie? do not rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. you will wish you had that time of your life back.

i watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. i was intrigued for the first whole hour. it was shaping up to be a great thriller. a very talented cast and good dialogue.then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. i couldn't believe my eyes.a great thriller was flushed down the toilet. the rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.i gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. i think that's a little generous, but i was entertained for a while. i'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all.if you are, then you may disagree with my opinion.

it's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not well shot, you don't care about the characters, not one single one of them. there's nothing that engages you in the narrative flow, you really could care less what happens. big, big waste of time and talent.

i saw hurlyburly on broadway and liked it a great deal. i don't know what happened with the film version, because it was dreadful. perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen. anyway, i couldn't wait for this film to be over. the acting is universally over the top. only kevin spacey has it together, and he seems like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.

acting 10, script 1. "hurlyburly" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. while people may get away with this on stage, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. we're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that, while brilliantly written, adds up to nothing. even worse, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. the only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif anna paquin use the word "ain't."never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme, the camera work is plain sloppy and (for la residents) the attention to geography is laughable. (hint: the view out sean penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window, and you can't drive south through hollywood and wind up in glendale pretending to be burbank.) okay, suspension of disbelief and all that -- and normally i wouldn't pay attention to little things like that, because they are just vagaries of production. but, the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise -- the script.in short, skip this one, even on video. rabe picked the wrong quote from the scottish play for his title; hurlyburly would have been better named "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." a bit long for the marquee, perhaps -- but at least it would be honest advertising.

a complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. the entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. the tagline for this movie should have read "come see how f*cked up our characters are! they're stoned! they're coke addicts! they're a mess! who are these people? do you really care? does it matter? just give us your money please, because we sure don't care about anything else!" an absolutely terrible movie. it never went anywhere, you never got to know the characters (they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke), and it was just downright boring. you might like the movie a little more if you're a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us that aren't, this movie is a waste of film and of time.

i watched hurlyburly as a second choice after affliction was sold out. i have never seen so many people walk out of a movie. sean penn, kevin spacey, and chazz palminteri can do nothing to save this coke-snorting, endlessly pedantic, bad mamet-wannabe.

that's what i felt like yelling as well as stomping out of the theater, but i restrained myself. yes the acting was great, no this wasn't the typical hollywood film, but the dialogue just wouldn't end (or get interesting)! and despite all the gabbing, you never get to really know or care about any of the characters. definitely the most boring film i've seen since sphere, but i was expecting that one to be boring. i had to sit through it, but please, spare yourself

i sat (uncomfortably) through this film becoming more and more staggered at just how it got made at all. the script itself makes the acting look embarrassing, and it fundamentally becomes a waste of time for everybody concerned. if you avoid seeing one film this year, make it this one.

did someone find the plot somewhere in the film?. perhaps it is the thing missing in this pretentious exercise of cinema about cinema. it is quite surprising that gordon says that "a movie without a plot is nothing"... it is possible that characters have more to say that the own wim wenders. was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a hint to the director?.

this film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry' because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon'.i was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of portugal which i have visited. it is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black-and-white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. that was the only good thing. the story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story.a film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait. well, a wait is a wait. i can wait for a number 15 bus on princes street in edinburgh, i can spend hours on a remote railway station in the middle of nowhere on cold winter's sunday afternoon. however a wait is boring and yes, this wait was boring too.so the leader goes off to america to remonstrate with the film supplier who castigates him for not making the whole thing in colour. after a number of arguments two blessed bullets ring out from wherever and the eagerly-awaited end finally arrives, and not before time.yes, i would see this film again if someone arms me with a couple of cans of colour film so that i can hurl them at the screen.

director delbert mann was a much better director than this film indicates. he directed all quiet on the western front, that touch of mink, and the last days of patton among others. this mediocre, made for television retelling of dicken's masterpiece is so bad, even those unfamiliar with the often filmed tale, will be unsatisfied.besides the fact that the movie is available from only two known suppliers (brentwood and bci eclipse llc) the poor quality of the transfer, and the scratchy and muddied sound track make the task of finding this film on video not worth the effort.i have always believed that if a company is going to put a film on video and charge the public money to buy it, then they should at least have a descent copy of the film and do a good job on the transfer. unfortunately neither of the two suppliers have such a work ethic and the result is only fit for the bargain bin in the local discount store.the story is told mainly through flashbacks, making the film episodic and talky. much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. the characters of martha, traddles and others have been cut and the relationship of young david and steerforth is not explored enough, so we are left wondering why david would hang out with the guy.the relationship between david the boy, and young agnes is never developed and it is hard to understand why she and david eventually marry. since martha is left out, it is a mystery how dan peggoty finds his niece. and the absence of traddles makes david a very lonely fellow.some have credited this film with doing a good job of abridging the lengthy novel. i disagree, this is at best a hatchet job on the book. anyone who has seen the 1935 george cukor version will agree.the performances in that version by fields as micawber and rathbone as murdstone, are definitely worth the trouble of watching it. and the more recent masterpiece theatre version (april 2000) and hallmark (2000) versions are both outstanding achievements in made for television adaptations of classic novels. directors simon curtis and peter medak who are responsible for those films are deserving of the highest praise.my final comment on david copperfield 1969 is don't buy it, there are several much better versions of the film available. if it is on television, turn the channel to something else. it is a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life. sorry folks, but i can't praise such an appallingly bad film.

this version of david copperfield is dreadful from start to finish. i knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment attenborough and olivier camp it up as two baddies. it was all downhill after this. aunt betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.the worst of the worst was the producer's choice for uriah. this was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by roland young. and what was all this self-absorbed angst from david. dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in his beer.this was one time when hollywood knew more than jolly old england.

one only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this david copperfield, but, alas, alas! how so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of literature's richest tales into such a monumental bore, is totally beyond me. it's pretty to look at with lovely photography, particularly the yarmouth sequences, but, just plain dull!!! no need to go on! skip it and check out the selznick or the marvelous bbc mini-series from the 1980's.

the worst movie i have ever seen. the sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...i first tought: "oh no, i don't want the trail that proves that poor patrick was an innocent killer". but this turned out to be even worse. typically in this american film you get a super-hint or no hints at all. i want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer. the audience isn't involved. and now, when i don't get any hints at all, you can expect a several 's/he-is-the-killer' sweeps in the end. and that is not all. ah... this is hopeless, lets make an end to it...in one word: disgusting..

it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw, however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe differed from the one circulating in the us.anyway, this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years. (closely followed by the waterboy...)why: because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one, mixed them, put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it.(examples: nothing happends, the music gets scary, and still nothing happends. the "grumpy" officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class. there¬¥s a buddy-moment which comes out of nowhere at the end. there¬¥s an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone.)if you want to see a smart movie: see memento. if you want to see a better thriller: see any thriller that comes to mind. if you want to see patrick swayze: see dirty dancing.

this movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script, which was mostly used up in the beginning. after that holes started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through. the movie followed a descending curve from good to ordinary to bad to ludicrous by the time it concluded. it's not recommended.

we get to see who the good guys are. the union. and who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. the filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. all the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film, this can help us along on hating the bad guys. this is the worst kind of film-making - manipulative and childish. the plot centers on a cop who is in-between the good and the bad, and he's stuck in this ugly film. it's boring and pointless. the narration by star keach is really bad. and a good actor, don stroud, overacted to the hilt, playing the guy no one likes, and who we aren't supposed to like. it takes a long time for this bore to take off, and for the title to assert itself; then when it does take off, it crashes a minute later. boring. one of the worst films ever made.

a real let down, the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for tv movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. stick to mike hammer. i find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, kubrick gushes over it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this one. stacey keach is too soppy as lou ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies tv spin off, of planet of the apes. i thoroughly recommend that you go out and buy lots of jim thompson novels though, actually the grifters isn't done too badly, thats one of his, starring jon cusak.

downhill racer is essentially, a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences. although there is a story here, robert redford's character, a skier trying to make the u.s. olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all. gene hackman, in an early performance, adds nicely, but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off, and it wouldn't make much of a difference.

what this film has is its realism , you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style . however the problem is unless you`re a big fan of the sport there`s not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention .before anyone asks why i watched it , i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but that`s not really a good enough reason for watching

if you're a kid liking fairy tale "real life" adventures, see it. if you're a youth liking kids movies, why not see it? :) if you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids, you're way better of opting for the squirrel!the start of this film was a bit funny, and set some good premises for the happenings to take place. but after the kind of funny introduction of characters, settings and potential conflicts, the story turned out kinda dull. when more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a dented lp or those commercials you really hate. and the culmination of the plot... *oh sigh*... poor, poor, poor!

i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change... i don't know...maybe it's because i'm not swedish...or french(the cannes commenter)...or any of those other sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth... born and raised in ny. lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century. and now holland. i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast... but this, in a word, isn't funny. see? now that's funny...that you're thinking that i made a mistake. i said, 'in a word' but then said, 'isn't funny'... nope. no mistake. if this is your type of humor, i'd say you haven't really had much of a life... consider your appreciation of this film a symptom... and please don't ever write another review...i have a tendency to believe them when they're unanimous. even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine...i figured i might actually be able to save someone else the boredom...the anticipation of laughter that never materializes... i did smile once or twice, though... when i started the movie...and when i stopped it. that should be 10 lines.

elderbush gilch was a big disappointment for me. i'd heared how great it was, how important it was. it just didn't strike me. it had a dim-witted story line, plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are thurroughly offensive by today's standards. while most of d.w. griffith's films have depth and intelegence, this one feels more like a formula-baised programme picture.i loved seeing lillian gish and mae marsh in pre-birth of a nation roles, plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good. acording to future griffith cameraman karl brown, audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry comes riding in at the end. i felt nothing. and beleave me, i lve watching griffith's early work at biograph. this film just isn't what it used to be.the best thing about this film it that, for all of it's flaws, it has many of griffith's touches to it. he handles his principal actors pretty well, plus the scene where the indians are encircling the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation, a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later.

why do i hate this? let me list the ways:i have nothing against mary pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid.there's a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it's considered funny---and it goes on for 15 minutes strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurtthe title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slursfor a "family" film the fights were way too violent (loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid seriously, 40 minutes in i gave up and turned it off. the slurs, racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me. also there was no plot that i could see. the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era.just painful. avoid.

in 1932, humphrey bogart was a relative unknown--an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. and, because he was an unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a b-movie--a quick film with relatively low expectations. after seeing it, i could see why it would still take bogart many more years and another film studio before he became a household name. while the film isn't terrible, it certainly isn't good--making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today.bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. however, when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way, his dreams all seem to go on hold. as one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water--they just don't mix.while bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is going full speed on the road to skankville--having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! bogey has no idea his sister isn't the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is....bogart's sister!!! all this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. however, what follows is one of the dumbest scenes i have watched in a very long time! by now, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with bogey's sister (whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for bogart, she's about to fly away and kill herself. bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! this is so utterly silly and ridiculous, i found myself laughing out loud. up until then, i might have scored it a 4 or 5--this sunk the movie to a 3 (how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me).the bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. on top of that, it's all wrong for bogart, as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. manly and solid better suits the man--one of america's great actors but clearly out of his element here.by the way, those who love pre-code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marital sex and bogey curses in the film--things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic production code was adopted in 1934.

this is so embarrassing. it's a remake of the wedding singer, which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to disapprove of this film. it has the same plot, same jokes, same characters. jeez, people need to be more original.

i must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying films i have seen in my entire life! annoying factor number one: never seeing the "son's" face (for the entire movie). and the infinitely more annoying factor: that incessantly ringing phone..nothing but listening to the phone ring over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...you get my point. the old man was being harassed but the viewer was too! at first the film was interesting to me but it deteriorated very quickly. the film may possibly have been good as a short but was definitely not enough to maintain anything approaching feature film length. i guess what i am trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally put in an appearance during the last two scenes of the movie) is secondary to this old mans being harassed. who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man spouting obscenities at someone prank calling him?? if you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy...check this one out!

i recently watched this film on the sundance channel and it kept me interested from the start. however, it seems to take forever getting itself where it wants to go and in the end, i felt somewhat cheated. in a nutshell, noble willingham (of walker, texas ranger fame) plays a boat salesman who starts getting harassed by telephone from a man claiming to be his son. according to the mysterious caller, willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects the son and he (the son) is enjoying reminding him of it. i won't spoil anything for anyone but for me three things kept me from liking this movie a great deal. one, the movie has more foul language than goodfellas, scarface, casino, and glengarry glen ross combined. 99% of it is spewed from willingham himself. it didn't take long to wear me out with constant four-letter words. two, i simply could not believe that anyone would answer the telephone that many times, especially when one knows that a crank caller is on the other end of the line. no matter where willingham is in the movie whether it be at work, home, a diner, etc., the phone rings and he always answers it spewing venom at the "son", and then hanging up only to answer it again when the caller calls back in about ten seconds! how many of us would do that? now i realize that we probably do not have a movie if he doesn't keep answering, but i just could not suspend disbelief on that particular matter. three, and this is the most minor of the criticisms, why is the director so opposed to showing us the "corndog man" (a.k.a. the caller/son)? most of the time he's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone. i could have lived with that one if other things had fallen into place, but since they didn't it's just one more to tack on. i do give the movie credit for being a somewhat original idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's about it. do see it, if only one time. however, if you're like me, you'll be saying "triple k marine!" in your sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it.

no way this overly simplistic script, with basically one character, should be interpreted as feature entertainment. in reality it has about enough material for an eighteen minute short, and even that would seriously tax your attention span. zero characters beyond noble willingham are developed. the never ending closeups of lips and telephones are sleep inducing, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. in fact this whole sad thing shouldn't have even been put on film. a tape recording would have been more than sufficient to put you to sleep. definitely not recommended. - merk

this film is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling, which tries to hide behind an "artfilm" facade, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to cover up for it's lack of psychological depth of the characters & internal conflicts. everything in this movie is pretentious, from the thank you's to bela tarr at the beginning, to the photography, the acting, music, the story & editing. when suddenly, without reason, you are forced to watch close ups of "charismatic" looking hungarian country people in their boats, while the soundtrack is trying to persuade you that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment, although they are only on the way to the funeral of the local alcoholic, thats one thing. putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing, for which i absolutely have no comprehension. this movie is trying really hard to enter a certain genre of artistic (east european drama kind of) films but lacks the subtlety, observational skills and "soul" that other directors have.

hungary can't make any good movies. fact. this is a great example of that.first of all the term "plot" does not exist in this movie. it's seriously weak. even tho a lot of people would argue with me on that. sure, it's about a taboo, but that's about it. there are endless possibilities, which could have been really great, if used, but they nearly skipped everything. i think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures, which are the only decent things in this whole pile of awfulness.the acting is just plain shitty. there aren't many lines, so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimicking abilities, but no. in fact, 86% of the time, they suck. and that's when they don't say anything. if they say even a single word, you'll start tilting your head, saying: "that's damn unrealistic". but than again, this is partly the fault of the writing. there's also no emotion in most of the dialogs.the editing is sometimes ok, but most of the time illogical and just worsens the whole picture. it could have given an emotional push, yet it seems the editing in here is all about putting cuts after each other.someone please explain it to me, why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. calling this an "art" isn't gonna make it better. sorry mundruczo, but you failed. live with it. even tho you probably won't care about my or any other guys opinion scarifying your "child".

i recently watched this movie because i'm a big kinski fan. but, oh my god. don't get me wrong. i love this guy. but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work! but fortunately he isn't the only one to blame. first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit. that's all. all the dialogs and characters are so bad it's making you scream. but maybe that's the fun of it all. if you know the kinski-biography it's obvious that kinski didn't care about those movies at all. especially all his italo-western roles. he just took the money and that was it. again, this whole movie is totally weird. only for hardcore-fans of the genre.

"cleo's second husband" is an amateurish attempt at psychodrama with more to fault than to praise. the plot is hacked, the story monotonous, the acting poor, the execution second rate, etc. not worth the time unless maybe your a relative of one of the actors. pu! (d)

usually a movie that starts bad stays bad in a monotonically descending pattern. this bad movie started to seem to get better before going into a steep dive. the acting, save for the male antagonist, was awful. the plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene, which is probably good as performance art, but it was wasted in this movie. not sure why this movie was made.

this movie is so mild! i tried not to expect anything greater from this film, but still it was a big disappointment. the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential. this could have been so much better. the characters are really simple, no depth at all. it's a shame that previously talented performers tiina lymi and petteri summanen didn't make the already poor characters any better. the director just don't get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of cr*p.and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie. that's hideous!!!why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation?it's too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it. oh no!

hitting the ground running, the film begins with three murders in a row. no plot, no characters, no motivation; the second murder happens off screen, and that victim's severed head is actually used to quite efficiently bludgeon the third victim to death! this is a high point. but the lewises are obviously smart enough to lead with strength; soon they're covering up botched dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shooting endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot. by now this betacam production's horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe, with the monumental (and rather endearing) plainness of the leads skewing things further in that direction. shlub cop investigates, meat cleaver guy slaughters, repeat, climaxing early with a memorable severed-finger-in-the-salad gag. only, how the hell did the fingers get in the salad? and wasn't the blood cult's purpose to collect the appendages they severed? when the gore stops making sense, you know you're in trouble. and without spoiling the big, nonsensical twist ending, just take my word for it: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode-tube-smashing impulse. the basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life.

what can i say? this was hands-down the worst movie i have ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are admittedly horrible). the acting was amateurish, the sets were boring, and the camerawork was shoddy and sophomoric. this whole movie seemed like a college final project. i had to keep convincing myself that it was done by a teenager to make it seem somewhat good. the most disturbing factor of the "film" is that it's not even film at all-- it 's shot on video. that was extremely distracting. on top of all that, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot line is so basic it makes my eyes water. not to mention they steal from at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so. if there were such a thing as zero stars, this movie would get it.the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is.

let me see...i've seen every film lou ferrigno has made. i've seen batman & robin...twice. i've memorized the dances in breakin' 2: electric boogaloo...i've watched unfinished blade runner rip-off student films...yet this film is the most painful thing i've ever seen.this was the first movie for the "straight to video market." so you can thank blood cult for all of those mysterious michael dudikoff films at your local blockbuster. you should know that this isn't even high quality video. this is consumer grade. this is you father's video camera he never uses. this is what you have to look at for 90 minutes.i won't bore you with plot details since i'm getting sleepy just thinking about it, but i will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. i only watch this movie when i am angry at myself. so i recommend this film if you are suicidal, or if you are up for a mighty challenge.if you happen to rent this film (god have mercy) you will know what you are in for from the first 10 minutes. this is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro. you know the drill. there's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies. yes, you've seen it before, but not like this. this is the most boring intro i've ever seen. i honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars, grab the bum that most smells like gin and candy, and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. it bored me to tears. i cried like a baby.another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its actors. yes, i've seen bad acting. trust me. i've seen 4th grade productions of oliver twist with more realistic dialog. the lead actor makes me ill. the "supporting" actress is a train-wreck of a human.i will not even comment on the boyfriend. true horror.so, rent this movie if you can find it. you'll never be more depressed that you spent 3 dollars on anything else.

**spoilers** the killer in the movie doesn't wait a second as we see him sneaking into a girls shower and hacking her to death taking her severed and bloodied arm as he makes his getaway. we then get this official looking prologue, as if were watching a true story, stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid-western collage.grandfatherly looking, and hearing impaired, sheriff ron delboys is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students, all women, continues his run for state senator is in jeopardy with him bumbling the investigation at every turn. there's at least two times when delboys says that they'll never be another murder as long as he's on the case and within minutes another murder happens.finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder the sheriff's daughter, the collage librarian, tina finds this reference book about withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witches cult that originated in the early 1700 just after the salem witch trials. this cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the local townspeople back in 1692 and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part. when the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual.you never get a handle to what's exactly happening in the movie "blood cult" not just because it's totally disjointed story but it's ever more outrageous and grad-school level acing especially by charles ellis playing the butterfingered sheriff ron delboys. getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into. the bumbling sheriff delboys ends up with his head busted coffee spiked as well as almost burned alive, after being dismembered. the only reason he wasn't is because he seemed to have dreamt it all up while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug.there's a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the witches cult that's responsible for the sorority murders. the movie doesn't bother to explain at all if the dream, that the drugged sheriff delboys had, was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie!getting out of the hospital and staking out the collage sorority house, while munching down a bag full of mcdonald cheeseburgers, sheriff delboys finally comes face to face with the killer. shefiff delboys find out to his shock and amazement that not only does he know who he, or she, is but he's also willing to let the killer escape!the very first straight to video motion picture and it shows. not only would no one it their right mind be crazy enough to pay admission, at least with the video you can tape over it thank god, to see this disaster but no movie-house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of the outraged patrons, in a justifiable show of righteous indignation, tear the place apart!

"nuts in may" may be one of the worst films i have ever seen. if ed wood was still alive this would be the type of movie he would be doing.to say this movie is bad would be the understatement of the century. but how bad is it really? well, here are two levels of bad i go by; "it's so bad it's good" or "it's so bad it's god awful". this film falls into the latter section. what little unintentional humor it has does not make up for the slow, hard to understand, boring majority of the film.summary: spoilers**two middle-aged anglos take a trip to the countryside for some r&r and camping, there they met ray soon-to-be jim (i'll explain later), who's tent is next to our main couple. throughout most of the movie the two leads go sight seeing on the beach, at a rock quarry and other exciting locations. in between these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism,fossil collecting, the duty of a proper citizen and proper diet, all thing i want to see in a comedy. they bore anyone who will listen to them. the dialogue is not only bad, but the pacing in some scenes is so slow i sometimes felt like dosing off. scenes would go on forever and just when it begins to build up and something is about to happen the scene ends. half way through the movie i thought to myself, "nothing is going to happen in this thing, it is truly a movie about nothing".the characters are annoying and constantly repeat things. at one part i felt the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience. the scene i am referring to is the "sing along" scene. in it our two boresome brits play some of there music for us, actually it was the same 4 four lines over and over and over and over. the idea was to get ray to sing along with them, but ray knew, as well as us, that they are the worst songwriters known to man. this scene was beyond tedious, by the fifth time the song was played i started to question the existance of a merciful god.words can not describe the awfulness of this film. the first thing that strikes you is the indecipherable british accents that most of the cast has. remember the thick scottish accents in trainspotting? times that by 10.towards the end our tree hugging, incoherent, couple get into a fight with some of ray's friends that have complete disrespect for the rules of camping. our hero becomes so incensed that a climatic battle ensues between our hero and the head hellraiser. to settle their dispute the two men engage in a stick fight. that's right a stick fight! now this is where the unintensional humor starts. i laughed so hard at the ineptitude of it all that i thought, "this may make up for the other 80 minutes." after this histerical battle our hero runs behind some bushes to cry his eyes out and the other man calls ray over by calling him jim for some unknown reason.a stick fight, a crying nature loving 40 year old and a character name change 3/4 into the movie, ed wood would be proud.though, i was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes which to sum up ends with a long take of a pig. why? who the hell knows. at one moment we see a pig grazing and the next the credits start to role over the screen. one of the worst endings to a one of the worst films of all time.

i don't know who financed it, or why, but this "want to be" vampire flick is really awful. it tries to be hip, and appeal to the young mtv-generation audience, but it is just downright laughable. the acting is horrible, and the directing is horrendous. i heard the budget was $600,000. i want to know where all the money went?

hi y'all,i bought this on dvd from england. you see, i have one of those multi-region players. i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends. well, surprise to amy-jo johnson, she's barely in the movie. although she is on the cover. it's really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place. perhaps someone has a trust fund.oh... it's about vampires who live at the beach

ok, let's see... a handsome young stranger is new in town, and walks around on the local boardwalk. he meets a pretty girl, meets up with the obnoxious leader of the local hip young vampires club, is dared by them to follow them into this cave, gets into a conflict over the pretty girl, an epic fight ensues...no, it's not lost boys, although you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference, since i think even some of the carnival music is the same. (do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie?) even the ending of this stinkbomb is ripped off from lost boys. the make-up is below par, even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and just exactly how many "oh, i had this horrible experience" scenes of teen angst does one movie need? the humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is sadly predictable. yawn.the only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a sequel, an idea that hopefully every distributor in the country will drive a stake through.

i saw this film at temple university. i cannot imaging that anyone will ever see this film in a theater (projected on film). the acting is similar to saved by the bell (the tv show). the plot is simple and unimaginative. the sound recordist likes the sound of wind and the dp needs a light meter. vampires, vampires, vampires.don't waste your money.

sigh¬Öthe stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course the experiments went terribly wrong, burdening us with a half man-half mutant who pukes an awful lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever he's upset. lance henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project, but he returns (bringing the whole family with him) when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree. "mind ripper" certainly is a watchable horror movie, but it's very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame clich√© you can think off (including the estranged father/rebellious teenage son sub plot...yawn). the characters are like wooden puppets, the dumbest things are being said and done and there's a completely pointless dream-sequence...coming from the monster!!! there's a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert-locations are effectively eerie. lance henriksen is adequate as always, even though this is yet another inferior production he stars, and giovanni ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in. for some reason, this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as "the hills have eyes part 3". is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert? is it because wes craven was once again involved, as a producer this time? or maybe it's because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky michael berryman in the 1977 original? who knows...who cares? wes craven probably financed this project because his son co-wrote the script and it's always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are. not recommended!

a scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong.the creators become trapped in a remote desert outpost,pursued relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation.james stockton,the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster,is called the outpost to help undo the horror that now lurks somewhere within the dark halls.james,together with his son and daughter,soon find themselves trapped inside with the others,trying desperately to survive.and with the outpost sealed from within,there is no way out..."the outpost"/"mind ripper" is highly unoriginal.the sets are pretty claustrophobic and there's a bit of gore.however as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levels.there's zero suspense,the script is weak and filled with big holes and the ending is extremely predictable.so-called master wes craven produced this one-i wonder if he is happy with this trash.joe gayton directs without any style.the acting is horrible,only lance henriksen can act at all.ok,i'm a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed.avoid it like the plague-it's just the same old boring crap again!

this is wes craven at his worst! this is the very worst horror, if you can call it horror, you will ever watch, esp from one of the masters of horror wes craven, poor direction, poor acting, poor set, poor atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of rubbish ever! the bad guy is totally unconvincing, you couldn't even feel sorry for the guy! the gore, and horror involved in the film is laughable, it's just plain rubbish! the only good points i can think of is, it stars natasha gregson wagner, giovanni ribisi, and lance henriksen, but not even that cast, could stop this from spiralling out of control, and into one of the worst horrors ever. if you still ain't watch it yet, don't bother, you'll only hate it.

hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade b performance and he delivers a rather good one. outside of madsen and hopper the acting is horrid; you've seen better at your local high school. the sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of b-movies. the scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes i've ever seen (it doesn't even come close to fitting in the movie). the script was probably a great 10-page outline, but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies madsen left behind. i do have to say hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the hummer had me laughing out loud, but i don't think that was the intent. yes there is a little style, and hopper can always draw my interest. however the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this.

well, shuck me sideways. i haven't seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal 13 seconds or half caste. someone should take away this guy's sony handycam! this movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $20, doesn't necessarily mean you should.i remember that one of the things that robert rodriguez wrote in his book, "rebel without a crew" was that when you set out to make a no budget feature, you have to use whatever assets you have at your disposal. rodriguez says that you should take an inventory of all the locations and props that you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. robert rodriquez was friends with the mayor of some town in mexico, so the mayor let him shoot all over for free. what you got in el mariachi was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budget.i'm sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book, and he took that advice to heart. in this case, he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put on a haunted house every year. seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep a cornfield interesting for 90 minutes. not a single installment of the children of the corn series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield. hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in north by northwest. take a hint, fella... cornfields don't make for riveting cinema. it would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations, because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first 15 minutes. this movie looks like it cost about $30. (or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield maze).apparently he couldn't even find anyone to act in his movie, so he cast himself. big mistake. here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. so, as far as assets go, it seems like the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had. maybe he thought that was enough. in fact, i'm going to go out on a limb and say that i know he thought that was enough because the movie, before it captured the coveted honor of being the sequel to dark harvest, was called simply the maize: the movie. maybe this he's already planning the maize: the musical or even the maize: the mini-series.our jack-of-all-trades (and yes, the master of nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here) plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen. think of the character from the dead zone, but not anywhere near as good an actor as christopher walken or even anthony michael hall. psychic dad has a premonition that his two daughters, who are at the corn maze with mom, are going to be killed. he rushes to save them. from that point on, the whole movie is spent watching pyschic dad run around in a cornfield, looking for his two daughters. he finds the two little girl ghosts from the shining, and he helps solve the mystery of their murder.shot on a $200 handycam. the director cast himself. edited on imovie. improvised story. if that's not enough to keep you away from this a-maize-ingly corny catastrophe, consider this as a final warning... the whole movie takes place in a cornfield, boils and ghouls. here's ghoulie guru's tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie. next time you see a cornfield, stop the car. take a flashlight and go run around in there for like 90 minutes.

my spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry i crapped myself.once you finish watching it, you stare at the tv set in confusion and horror. then, there's a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice hisses, "you will die in seven days." you turn around, and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one that suggested this movie when you were in blockbuster.i won't lie: this is the worst movie on the face of the earth. i saw it with 5 of my friends all 18-year-old guys, and these were our reactions: -one person actually began crying and punching himself -one person screamed and passed out -one person stood up and staggered out the front door to reappear more than an hour later -one person simply blacked out (this one was me) -one person started babbling incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and touretts' syndrome -one person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutesthe movie really is that bad. there's one part where the retarded cameraman actually trips (while holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it in. seriously, you can hear him grunt and swear when he hits the ground. there's only one special effect, and it's special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a rubix cube is special: the camera rotates so that the on-screen action (action, n. some dumbass lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes) does a barrel roll.under no circumstances should it be watched, and the movie itself even warns you of this fact. do you know what the tagline on the back is? "some warnings should not be ignored." i honestly think that the release of this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the producers' part. that's not to say, however, that you should pass it by if you see it at the movie store - it would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see. rather, buy every copy of it you can get your hands on and mail them to people that you hate.

this is by far the worst ever 'horror' movie, no, make that any movie, i have ever watched. shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap. i never ask for a refund on any movie, but i think this will be a first.the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it.i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping.the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster.

this movie was so bad i don't know where to begin, apparently neither did the filmmakers. it starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching tv. the news tells of a corn maze that's open for halloween. he has a "vision" of god knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this "vision" how you ask? i don't know, and as i said before neither do the filmmakers. they're simply visions of people's feet. how did he get these "visions"? it's never explained, we're just supposed to go along with it. he enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he's looking for walk right past him, one time they actually run into him. what does he do? does he chase after them? no. he stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past. do the girls stop? no. they run off then ask "was that dad?" then someone dressed as demon jumps on the "star" (the dad character) he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he's a worker at the haunted maze. the police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a really bad term to use) they cuff him. they cuff his hands in front of him, so that he can find something to pick the lock with, which he does. first off, anybody who's ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back, and secondly why does this "average guy" seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs? well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the "star's" wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction. by the way, it's now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down. leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers, why not. besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well. by the way, the "star" who goes by the name of "walker", we figure out it's his last name, a name in which his wife even calls him by. somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging. i say 'somehow' because i couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. he finds a locket, what does it mean? nothing to anyone who watches this, but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime. somebody killed their kids in his "vision" and i guess that's what he's going on, real detective work. and by now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze, one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film, which is why he's looking for his girls. every time we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a weird robotic sound, like a sci-fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical. why do we hear this sound? is it in anyway related to...anything? again, who knows? certainly not the filmmakers. the peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when "walker" yells out "hey you, mr. bad man...i'm gonna get you." another time his wife is attacked by the "bad man" at the entrance to the corn maze, which like i mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen. the "bad man" calls "walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well. "walker" can only reply with "hey. hey!" before dropping his phone and running off. with no one on the other end to talk to, the killer drops his phone too, he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film, losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats. if this script wasn't written by a child i'd be surprised. opps it wasn't. it was written, directed, and produced by the same guy. and not only that, he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well, where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield, that waste 90% of the film time. in the end "walker" uses the cuffs to cuff the "bad man", who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that "walker" had picked it with. apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield. but after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids "walker" kills the "bad man", and everything is right with the world again. now in reality this makes "walker" a murderer, he's killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his. he knows this, not because of proof, but because of his visions. he never found a body, nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze. and the locket? he gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls. no proof. so he kills a man without any tangible reason. i can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. it must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company. i would rather watch the blair witch project five times than see this film again. the actors should be ashamed. the director/producer/writer/cameraman should also be ashamed. in fact the entire production company should be ashamed. if there is anyone associated with this film, please reply. what were you thinking?

only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be 'unredeemable' i will state the following without repeating the obvious flaws plainly stated by some of the other commentators: the "film" is shot on video (what type of camera i don't know) but the cameraman had it on autofocus(!) all the time, so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus. in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. this alone screams "amateur".i also noticed that out in the 'middle of the cornfield', you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights ... loudly.also what is with that single lighting source that follows (and many times 'leads' the actors) when they walk around. it looks like a newscaster with that 'on camera light' that follows the people around like a spotlight. there was no 'credit' for lighting design/dp and i know why. the 'filmmakers' saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture (note i didn't say "film"). so be prepared for a single glaring spotlight as the sole source of 'cinematic lighting' for most of the movie. ughhh!!!this is probably the most technically inept production i've ever seen commercially released. i "bought" this title because i like bad cinema. usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it. this is just so bad that it's unwatchable. plan nine from outer space is "citizen kane" in comparison to this title.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen, as well as, the worst that i will probably ever see. i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously, just be forewarned...this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it, its just plain bad bad bad bad bad.this movie is the equivalent to having a "pet rock" as your friend. you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. unfortunately, it never does. at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. lion's gate completely deceives on this bombshell... no...this is a disaster. after watching this film, you would swear george w. bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic.stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. its probably how lion's gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe.

anyone can make a movie these days. budget, production value, or experienced crew don't have to stop the self described "director" from "realizing their dream" these days.respect for the craft of film-making, or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.director bill cowell must have thought he struck gold when lion's gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.i personally find lion's gate far, far more in error than cowell in regard to dark harvest 2 being made available to the public. lion's gate's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general's office and lion's gate's officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film, film-making, and good sense.as for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on.

completely agree with other review.i watched this movie for about 5 minutes. i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand, jaw dropping lower and lower. the quality of the filming is beyond low budget. it doesn't even look like a freaking movie. if i were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary i would expect it.in summary: avoid, avoid avoid. boooo lion's gate!completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and i hope that i've saved others from renting or owning it.

besides the comments on the technical merits of the production, or lack thereof, the acting is absolutely horrible. what is really scary about this movie is that i actually own a copy of it, of course, it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as "dark harvest 2", and after having seen it, i can understand why it was in the bargain bin - they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventory.the majority of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them. i suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. in the maze, he runs into the ghost of some children, which are poorly done, and the movie goes horribly south from there.i can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise, they would never have gotten rid of them. absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through, and it wasn't worth the $2 i spent on it.

a guy, with the unlikely name of shy walker, looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. that's the entire plot...with across-the-board bad acting, of course. walker wanders around a corn maze (maize? i get it! hahaha...not funny) and yells "girls? where are you?!?" about 1000 times. for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin, a chipmunk-sounding voice laughs (as if the pumpkin is laughing at him, yeah ok...). his daughters scream for most of the movie...even when there is no reason to scream (maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie?). twin girls straight out of 'the shining' show up every now and then. most of the corn maze looks the same so walker's search gets very old very quickly. the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie (even the music is repetitive) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast, filming upside down, inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary, and rotating the camera 360 degrees (at least i'm assuming these were done intentionally but it's likely just examples of incompetent film-making). more often than not, when walker is wandering through the maze, you can't see his face. i guess the kid holding the camera can't look up that high... this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'dark harvest' (which doesn't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield). don't be fooled by the r rating. walker says the f word three times and now we have "an r-rated horror movie", ugh. the scarecrow on the cover doesn't even show up in this movie...and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back, you know things are bad! instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around (unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr. walker so i didn't even realize he was being followed for a while). i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did (the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). the end of the movie drags on and on...and just in case it isn't slow enough, there's some slow-motion! the last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very poor sound-dubbing. in case you can't tell, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. at least they didn't end with the promise of another sequel!

this is absolutely the most stupidest movie ever produced in front of a camera. i cant believe i was gullable enough to rent this piece of junk. i have seen some bad movies in my time, but this takes the cake....ice cream ,,,, and chips too. omg, i still cant get over how bad this thing was. the acting was a joke.... the plot was non exsistant..and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old child. i have never seen a movie take so long to go nowhere. i mean the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes. i guess this guy had some extra time on his hands.... ( like 3 hours. ) and an extra 60 bucks in his wallet, and decided one night...( hey ..lets go make the stupidest movie ever made. ) and they did just that. give me a break.i'm heading back to the video store right now to get demand my money back.anyone else who has watched this piece of trash, should do the same.

i rented dark harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on -the-box type of thrill ride. scarecrows also freak me out. the movie had an effective title sequence, but what followed was pretty lame (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction...). recently, i noticed that dh 2: the maize had a pretty extensive ad campaign. i thought maybe the first one was marginally successful, so they upped the ante on this one a bit, possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and fx from the killer scarecrows. well, there are no scarecrows in the video... not a problem. the problems start in dh 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot. as far as the actual photography... every time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all these blown out whites, confirming that you're watching some ultra-low budget mini-dv project that some midwesterner filmed at his uncles farm. the acting was not acting at all. the cheap rip-off of the shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards. the editing was extremely amateur and lazy. the sound was jarring and choppy. (e.g.- every time the editor would cut to a new shot, you'd here the sound change perspective with it). it's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days, put a light on top of it for the night sequences (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned through some tape, stuck the footage in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, tossed in some music, bypassed any imaginative sound work or mixing, burned it directly to dvd, and threw it on the video store shelf. any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is void of any skill or style. just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get somewhat of an image on tape, doesn't mean it should be released to the public. if i could give this a rating lower than a one, i would.

no. just no. that's all that needs to be said.summary: a random guy is in a cornfield. for some reason, i'm not sure, but it's his duty to run around inside. the next great thriller?a five year old could make a better movie just filming an anthill, or even just grass growing. seriously.....you can't say it has bad acting, because there is no acting. you can't say it has bad writing, because it has no writing. you can't say it has bad cinematography, because there is no cinematography. you can't say it's a bad movie, because there is no movie! if you don't believe me, go watch it. just don't say i never warned you.....

i couldn't even...i mean...look....okay...wow.not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit.i can only think...how. how do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed (or even their lives) and con-artists like the guy who made this get a dvd on a shelf? it seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at subway and made the worst thing he could think of."hey guys, give me some ideas. start with a corn-field and work backwards." "well, you've gotta have actors straight out of high school, and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached. and boobs." thanks, guy, i'm sure that you and windows movie maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project.

this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies in the history of cinema. the screenplay is really well done (which is not often the case for this type of movies) and you can see that chuck (in one of his first role)is a great actor. the final fight with the sherif deputy in the bullring is a masterpiece!

this is a very very boring and uninteresting action film, and without chuck norris it would have been unbearable!, plus the low budget shows big time!. some of the fights were good, but the story is laughable, and there no menacing villains at all.the dialog was laughable i had some trouble finishing this film, but chuck norris, made it somewhat bearable. i really have nothing more to say, since i was only paying half attention,because it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end. the direction is terrible. don hulette, does a terrible job here, with lousy photography, an awful pace, and overall the film looked dull!. there is no gore. the acting was terrible. chuck norris is very good here, he kicks that ass, and he made the film almost bearable(chuck rules!). george murdock, is terrible as the main villain, and very unconvincing. terry o'connor, is decent here, and had okay chemistry with chuck. michael augenstein, is decent as chuck's brother. overall it's quite simple avoid! * out of 5 (chuck saves it from the bomb rating).

i bought this chuck norris dvd knowing that it was one of his earliest films, and it shows. we all know that he will never win an oscar for his acting, but that's not what we watch him for. although there have been a few earthquakes in california since this movie was made, there never was any desert or hills between hwy.99 and i 5. billy was supposedly crossing over from 99 to 5 along 120, a distance of less that 15 miles. i wish that the writers, producers and directors of these movies would, at least, look at a map. as a truck driver who spends a lot of time in california, i could tell right from the start that the geography was wrong. however, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. so grab your doritos and an adult beverage and enjoy a trip back in time.

i work in an office on weekends, and there is a tv that only gets one channel. so, i don't have the option of turning to something better. i keep it on, though, because it provides a little background noise. sometimes, i get a decent movie/show. not today. today, i got "breaker breaker." the city looks like a third rate set (which, of course, it is). all the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school. i have seen better dramatic enactments at a carnival. the special effects (flames at end of movie are more fake then michael jacksons masculinity). even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor... a badly acted, badly shot, badly written movie.

ever want to see a movie where chuck norris takes the bad guys aside and calmly discusses with them the errors of their ways until they see the light and, with tears in their eyes, they shake hands, right the wrongs of the world together in peace and harmony and forever end the reign of evil in the world?well, forget it, jocko. "breaker! breaker!" instead goes right for the drop-kick as our truck-drivin' man chuck steers his big rig into the small backwoods town where his little brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even-more corrupt law-men. chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and crinkle-cuts every baddie in sight until not an evil-doer dares raise his head. a lot of fights are in slow-motion, for excitement purposes, but just help pad out the movie to fill 86 minutes.and there's a lot of fights here, which leave just about 15 minutes for plot development...and that's about all the plot you get. but what did you expect: calm discussion?one star for "breaker! breaker!"; and that's a small 10-4, good buddy.

ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work:first put in loads of hillbilly truckers--good ole boys who have secret desire to take law into own hands. second put in evil hillbilly cops controlled by a texas bred outlaw. third put in karate fighting trucker played by chuck norris. fourth put in a chump teenager as norris's nephew captured by evil hillbilly cops. fifth show chuck norris fighting in slow motion.now mix all together and what have you got?you guessed it...one very mediocre movie!

i caught this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. however, since it is supposed to be an action movie, i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional.chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family, and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film. good thing too, 'cuz the sub-par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast. actually, the judge was pretty good, but i can't really describe what makes him work, you'll have to check it out for yourself.and the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic!

in terms of quality movies, this isn't one of them. it's actually the first chuck norris movie i've seen and i was left pretty underwhelmed. the fight scenes are slow and don't have a lot of variety. norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring. the movie also is quite short, but for some reason the movie doesn't even seem finished when it ends. it's a pretty anti-climatic ending. all the same though, i've watched a lot of bad movies, and this isn't one of the worst that i've seen. it's worth a watch, i'm guessing especially for norris fans. there's also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie.

saw this used dvd cheap, and got it for a chuckle. i had recently also found "the octagon" on dvd and bought that one to reminisce, having seen it in the theatre as a pre-teen, and loving it at the time. the problem now with "going back" to these american karate films, is that i've since then seen so many hong kong and thai action films, in which the fight scenes are long, fast and jaw-dropping. i'm thinking particularly of fights like jackie and benny "the jet" at the end of "dragons forever", or tony jaa's circular-stairwell fight from "the protector". the hollywood kung-fu offerings are just not "filmed right", and even make someone of certified skill, such as chuck, look awkward at times. and what's worse than a fight going into slow motion? then you know it looked crappy at normal speed, so they slowed it down for effect. it really highlights how ridiculous an opponent looks as they stand and just wait to get kicked in the chest.poor chuck, he just has no intensity in this film, nor does he project any righteous menace. compare that to his former co-star bruce lee, who had charm and attitude to burn. when bruce would square off against some opponent(s) you could nearly see the air around him crackling with what was about to happen. in "breaker, breaker" chuck seemed to accidentally be kicking people, with complete nonchalance. when the judge comes to see him in jail, and sentence him to death, chuck is staring off with a sad look, and i thought "ok...he's doing that 'third eye' focus thing and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of this", but he does nothing except look up with a doe-eyed stare. terrible. and while the dvd case gives you hope, listing a run time of 1 hour, 5 minutes, it's actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there's 20 more minutes of viewing pain. for great fight action, go watch jackie chan in the first "police story"....the fight in the shopping mall at the end is pure gold......

save some very early norris, "breaker, breaker" has nothing to offer which can't be found ten fold better on any broadcast channel. a pathetic attempt at film making, this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. in spite of that, i did watch it, thumbing the fast forward button, because the acting was so awful it was comical. of course, the film is supposed to be an action/drama but turned out as a treatise on how not to make a movie. everything which could be wrong with film is on screen in this "dog". if you happen across it, give it a peek. it's so bad, it's funny.

i've always been a fan of chuck norris for what he's accomplished and his movies. for while i had been meaning to watch this film, but for whatever reason didn't have chance. apparently i didn't miss much. this has to be one of chuck's worst films. so this trucker, billy dawes (augenstein) is given the chance to make his delivery, but on the way he is detoured and forced into a jerkwater town where a foolish local corrupt judge trimmings (murdock) who runs the whole town, has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him. he denies the charges and makes a run for it. the local hick cops beat him and he disappears. but now his brother jd john dawes (norris) another trucker goes looking for him. he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town. in the meantime the female of the film calls on local truckers on a cb radio, and they all come rushing into town demolishing it. lol with there big rigs. eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs.this movie was pretty bad. it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops, because there such losers. but there is virtually no story, the acting is bad, and the ending ¬Ö..well it doesn't really have one. the judge has his house rammed into by a big rig and you never know what happens. does he live? norris never even gets to trash him. in the meantime norris takes on some thug cop at the end. who cares? norris also manages to take on everyone in town, gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting. come on! this movie was apparently made to cash in on the cb craze of the time, why there was one is beyond me. they barley even use the cb's in the movie. adding to this, the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet. this movie is bad, but if you're bored and need something to watch it will pass the time. as far as norris he went on to make much better films than this. 3 out of 10.

breaker! breaker! has chuck norris as a truck driver and a karate master, talk about juggling two disparate careers. he gives a load he can't deliver to his younger brother michael augenstein and then when the young man doesn't show up, chuck goes looking for him.what young augenstein has got himself into is a speed-trap run by judge george murdock who comes from the roy bean school of jurisprudence. of course norris deals with matters in the usual chuck norris way and when he gets in trouble, the call goes out over the cb for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy. this speed-trap known as texas city has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal.chuck's of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one. he's got the tight lipped look of a man who realizes the academy won't be looking at this gobbler. george murdock is overacting outrageously as the judge roy bean wannabe.this one is strictly for the fans of chuck norris.

summary: not worth the filmas an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clich√©d "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fianc√© and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

this movie was nothing like the book. i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down. this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway. the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action. none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book. for a gone with the wind fan (of both the book and the movie) this was deeply disappointing. if you loved the book scarlett, don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen. they only share the title in common.

margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess! fine costuming and sets can't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley (as the title character) and the ever-bland timothy dalton (as rhett). even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script, which is astoundingly cliched and predictable. add to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing, and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer. scarlett is just amazingly lousy, and i can't imagine how it ever got made, much less made it to video.

alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's. margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels. i was a huge fan of margaret mitchells book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money.although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton, this is a really terrible film. the script is horrible and full of clich√©s. ann margarets cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her.the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy, feral villain - lord fenton. sean bean's performance is along the lines of "the man you love to hate" and portrays an unsafe sex symbol.but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script.don't waste your money on this film, unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance.

i supposed i was actually expecting a bollywood remake of "the fog", from the title, but this is actually more of a bollywood remake of "i know what you did last summer", with some elements of "scream", kind of, sort of, and not a very good one either. apart from a couple very entertaining song & dance numbers, this is pretty terrible. it's obviously got a decent budget & yet it's wasted on reheated leftovers that weren't that tasty to begin with. a young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest, because he wants his sister to win (she, thankfully, doesn't look as creepy as her brother), but she enters anyway and wins, and of course the creepy guy comes after her, and is killed, after which comes a rousing game of "hide the body". of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they're waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist. interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers, especially the celebratory dance number at the party for simran, the girl who won the beauty contest...it's highly colorful, it's well done & downright fun, and utterly wasted in this terrible film. i would much rather watch an old ramsay brothers movie than this piece of crap, although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available, for the most part, which is a crime in itself. but not as big of a crime as this film. i took one for the team watching this one, so take my advice, don't bother. 2 out of 10.

legend has it that at the gala hollywood premiere screening of 2001: a space odyssey, about 20 minutes into the film rock hudson yelled out "would somebody please tell me what the hell this movie is about?" well, i have rock beaten by about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. this movie made absolutely no sense at all. who were those people? where were those people? what were the rules of the game called quintet? are there any rules to quintet? were robert altman and his cohorts making the movie up as they went along? what was paul newman thinking when he signed on to this? maybe ol' fast eddie saw zardoz and thought "well if connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense, so can i." maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff. also, did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats? you never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life. quintet just confirms what i've always thought: when altman's good he's superb, but when he's bad, he makes stuff like quintet

quintet marks the only venture of both paul newman and director robert altman into the realm of science fiction. it was said of newman that he could not do comedy, but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with slap shot. but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again.this is one of the biggest downer films i've ever seen. it's a futuristic ice age, brought on by who knows what, but presumably it's a nuclear winter. even during the ice age of thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life, but apparently not here. seals have survived and paul newman is a seal hunter on the outside.but hunters do need a little r&r and newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of russian roulette. to win you have to kill five other participants in your game.it's a sad turn to see what man has come down to. which is one of the reasons i just could not get into this story. the atmosphere is bleak, the story is bleak, the people are bleak, it's all so bleak. no wonder this thing came up short at the box office.it's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of paul newman films, including me.this is man's future, what a bummer.

the best thing i can say about "quintet" is that it's not quite as bad as i remembered it being on my first viewing.but that doesn't mean it's good.this weird, sci-fi thriller is not quite like any other movie i've ever seen, which i guess at least gives it the stamp of novelty. but it's a borderline disaster of a movie, and one of the worst robert altman ever made. on the dvd special feature about the making of "quintet," it's clear that even altman didn't know what the hell the movie was supposed to be.it's set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. the film was shot at the abandoned site of the montreal expo '67, and i do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements, even if much of it looks like it's being filmed in an iced-over shopping mall. paul newman, looking zonked out and absolutely disinterested in anything going on around him, and brigitte fossey, play drifters who wander into this futuristic city looking for newman's brother. soon newman is caught up in a deadly game of "quintet," which all of the bored inhabitants play for lack of anything better to do, and the rules of which are never made clear to the audience. all we know is that the object of the game it to kill everyone else you're playing with and remain the only person alive. this gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only thrill, because as one of them says at one point in a psychobabblish soliloquy, only by being near to death can one appreciate being alive.the movie is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its unrelenting gloominess. it's almost as if altman was purposely setting out to make a movie no one would want to sit through. there aren't characters -- oh sure, actors walk around speaking lines, but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors altman assembled for this register not a whit. only bibi andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could possibly be found in a movie like this. but nevertheless, it does succeed in establishing an atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is one of pure awfulness, and it is oddly fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly starve himself to death would be fascinating.altman really hit a dry spell after nearly a decade of superb films. "quintet" followed close on the heels of the atrocious "a wedding" and was followed in short order by the not bad but mostly forgettable "a perfect couple," the by-all-accounts terrible "health" (which i've never seen because it's not available anywhere to see) and the disastrous "popeye." thank god he rebounded.grade: d-

the things that i find irritating on screen, the things i nitpick about and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are those moment where the writer, director, set-designer, on screen caterer, or whoever, doesn't think it through to the end and, by a single act of omission - or commission - undoes all the other work done by everyone else who has worked on the movie. that moment of "wait a bloody minute.... what just happened?" that stops the narrative dead in its tracks. (not that this film's narrative needed a lot of stopping, because anyone who has ever seen it will know that quintet's narrative drive has pretty well frozen solid before the end of the opening shot.) there are several of those moments in this movie. and you get so long to think about them too. the film is two hours long and the scripted dialogue probably ran to five pages. there's a lot of time to ponder its deficiencies.the movie is set in a frozen earth. another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying. it's cold. very cold. it's actually very cold on the screen. the movie was shot in canada in winter and there are icicles and real snow and people's breath misting from their mouths in every scene. time and again we are reminded how fecking cold it is. people wear big hats and layers and layers of clothes and waddle around like over-dressed weeble people. must have been a horrible shoot. my nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero checks into a room of a hotel. woken up in the middle of the night by voices coming from the room next door, he overhears a conversation of vital importance to the meagre plot through an large grill in the wall dividing the two rooms. i'm not questioning why there is a convenient grill in the wall between the two rooms. what got me annoyed was the fact that the grill had not been blocked up by the long term tenant with the noisy visitor. if you are trying to keep warm the last thing you need is a huge gaping draughty hole in your wall that leads into an unoccupied unheated room. trust me. i live like this, i watched this film sat on my living-room sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle. my breath was misting as much as the actors'. if that whacking great hole was in my wall i'd block it up with something. maybe not the best choice of movie to watch in an unheated room in midwinter but boy did it make me notice the lousy insulation in the film.

this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling, moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts. it just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film.but it's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral. a vaguely plausible plotline (and that's being generous)becomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzarre events are never explained.this wouldn't be quite so bad if the scripting wasn't so cheesy, the acting so wooden (despite a strong british cast) and the direction so uninspiring. this is not an example of good british film making nor indeed should it make tarantino bat an eyelid, at least not in comparison to his earlier work.my advice in this case, if it's hard to get hold of, don't waste the effort. if you're a brit like me and it's in your local video shop, steer well clear. perhaps head to the video entitled "american beauty" - now that's an example of great british direction.

independent film that would make hollywood proud. the movie substitutes good looks for good acting, a cryptic plot for a good story line, and self-absorption for character development. may be i missed something, go see it for yourself.

weak direction, weak plot, unimpressive music, i wonder why udita goswami is there in the movie world in the first place ? she tried to reveal a lot of her talent (mostly skin) but failed to impress.music wasn't that impressive as well, only one song "jhalak dikhlajaa" was worth listening to..... aksar, the title ? well they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end, but it didn't make sense..there were many unwanted twists and turns in the story, which made it more boring. however if someone's a dino morea fan, please go ahead and watch it.

emraan hashmi post murder did some good roles in bhatt films but other director just made use of his kissing and naughty imageaksar is one of them and it came after aaa, jawani diwani in a row and i was already fed up of him and such roles the film has a nice twist at the start i felt like an abbas mustan film but then it turns into a routine film with sudden love, sudden jealousy and a bad climaxanant mahadevan makes a terrible film music is saving grace camera-work is fabulousemraan hashmi just repeats his act of his earlier films and has 2 expressions throughout dino looks stiff, talks as if he is practicing hindi and does okay in some scenes udita is expressionless and irritates

aksar is an awful movie. the script, the story, the acting are all simply laughable. dino morea plays a man who pays emraan hashmi to seduce his wife. yes, this is as ridiculous as it sounds. both morea and hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprisingly bad acting. udita goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. she is good-looking but has zero acting talent. the film has one hit song called "jhalak diklaja" which is composed and sung by himesh reshammiya. i never could understand the hype around this song as i never found it particularly good though it is catchy. the film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it just looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing. avoid this cheapo at any cost.

i often wonder how movies like this even get made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them.with aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along, adding twists and turns when he liked, no matter how ludicrous they were. the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as "jo sheena roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai" and "yeh versace hai madam" (yeah right).every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. acting was awful. constumes (lycra for udita and awful suits for a stocky emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion), screenplay etc etc, just one word- rubbish.for those people who love hashmi and his movies, watch it. as for me, i'll never get those two and a half hours back. the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent.

what movie is this??? a horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the "bhatt camp". the movie starrs emraan hashmi, udita goswami and dino morea. the movie has "no base". it just goes like this... dino an udita are married and living in a rich mansion. however dino doesn't like udita to the heart as he wants only her wealth. he loves someone else (tara sharma). so he bribes emraan to have an affair with udita so that he could catch them and finally split up with udita.. how boring!! however emraan falls in love with udita and vice versa. lastly when udita gets imprisonment for killing emraan, dino pretentiously tries to save her showing his false love to her. udita on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly. so she lends all her wealth to dino. finally dino comes out of the police - station and goes with tara with all the wealth. what a fraud!! the songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie. now the individual ratings: (out of 5) emraan: * * udita: * 1/2 dino : * 1/2 overall acting: * 1/2 direction: * * story: * music: * * * 1/2 final rating: * 1/2 poor performances and poor casting....... music: good... i rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (dont waste your time !!!!)

not a good one. -not at all.this installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of amityville itself.it's basically nothing. my bet is that this film was made for some extra fast-cash to buy a boat or something... because this one's just ridiculous... thankfully, it doesn't kill or ruin the series, but it just has no effect on the series at all.i'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than "the amityville curse".

at the rate these movies are ploughing through the artifacts from the amityville house it won't be long before we get down to the floorboards, but for now it's a mirror that's causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry in the series. a homeless man hands it over to artist hairdo ross partridge, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. this mundane horror trundles along at a dull pace, leaving us waiting for a build up that never comes as the various 'spooky' goings-on lead to a dumb finale. bland and lifeless, with ropey acting and partridge's huge hair not helping matters.

oh dear. this sequel has a mirror, this time, which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the amityville home. the mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest. the mirror is given to a photographer, keyes(ross partridge)by a bum(..who just so happens to be his lunatic father, and the man responsible for killing the family)and it's evil soon terrorizes those in a loft(..such as keyes' painter pal suki, portrayed by julia nickson-soul)where he lives when they look into it. soon keyes is having nightmares, looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood, worried that he might follow in his footsteps. soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops bashed his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's administered a drug to immobilize him.pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this, such as david naughton(american werewolf in london)as the proprietor of the loft with which keyes lives, richard roundtree as an eccentric sculptor/artist, terry o'quinn as a psychologist-detective, and especially lin shaye as a hilarious ditsy, rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum(..the one which held keyes' father) soon to be closed down.rounding out the film, the sexy, leggy lala sloatman as keyes' supportive girlfriend, barbara howard(friday the 13th:the final chapter)as naughton's betrayed wife(..he was on the verge of starting an affair with nickman-soul), jack orend as the sadistic fiend who attempts to provoke his son into killing innocent people as he did, and robert rusler(a nightmare on elm street 2:freddy's revenge)as a rejected lover(..of nickson-soul)who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his dismissal.this film is a poor special effects movie merely using the amityville title as a cash-in. the franchise has never been that great to begin with, but as each sequel was green-lit, it grew worse and worse. after the third film, furniture from the infamous house become "possessed" items tormenting folks. the cast try hard, though, but the material(..a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means)is lacking in quality..and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters. o'quinn, as little as he has to work with, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in excrement such as this. all's not lost, you get to see sloatman always wearing super short skirts(..or her man's shirt in panties), showing off her legs throughout..hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. believe it or not, amityville:a new generation was the seventh film in the franchise! coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by nickson-soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it.

'a new generation' is the third amityville entry to base its plot around writer john g. jones's premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. first a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. however, this is also the first amityville since 'the possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. this time around, keyes terry (robert partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named franklin bronner (sonny montelli in 'amityville ii') murdered his entire family. unfortunately for terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood.this 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'it's about time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. however, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. one of the biggest weaknesses of the amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. on the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*.there's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. or maybe it's just tedious anyway. director john murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. there were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. if they don't take it too seriously, why should we?which is a shame, because 'a new generation' has a more-than-capable cast. i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name 'julia nickson' in the credits. she captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, i was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. terry o'quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while i'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing ibsen.the sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. clearly, murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all.'a new generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. however, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'the possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.

well, at least this was the last sequel that i could find at blockbuster, because this movie was just downright horrible. i mean, i can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house. we're talking starting a horrible fire, bulldozing, flood, etc. but a mirror? how hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror?! this was the most horrible movie that could've put the title of amityville into the picture! well, a group of friends who are pretty much from the start, are a bunch of freaks. one of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy, teaching me a valuable lesson, don't buy things from homeless creepy guy. of course, the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group, though i can't imagine anyone missing them.please, skip amityville: a new generation, i've already got a few complaints about my generation, so i think this was a premonition. not to sound so crazy. :p but believe me, this is horribly acted, not well thought out, and not even scary! i feel so bad for the original writers of the amityville horror, they must be crying every time person witnesses this film.1/10

there isn't enough space to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess. silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of this movie's problems. the film looks like it was conceived in the mid-eighties and just stewed until it could finally be made in the early nineties. the mullet-headed "hero," (complete with fashionable "miami vice" three-days shadow beard), the ham-fisted slams at ronald reagan, it would be funny if it didn't take itself so seriously. as it is, the movie is just pathetic. i actually feel sorry for the poor actresses who wasted their fine nude scenes in this awful movie.

movies just don't get worse than this. horrible plot, terribly timed, pathetic characters and effects and yes this is using "b" standards.and for the guys: nothing, this movie is a terrible let down, couple scenes that could have been great but you get nothing but build up with no delivery.this movie appeals to no one, horrible movie,it had bad; plot, acting, "b" flavor, special effects and everything else. plus no nudity or erotics for guys or the girls.

the fact that a film is on dvd doesn't guarantee that its quality is very good. the fact that a film's quality is threadbare doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. this review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single dvd.the plots of these films are of little consequence. they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films ¬Ö anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett ¬Ö or, in a pinch, basil rathbone. there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a one-shot basis ¬ñ such as "seven per cent solution" or "private life of sherlock holmes". in any event, these films are considerably less estimable.here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes, even if the results tend toward disappointing. this appears to be the only disc with these films on it (although "deadly necklace") appears by itself in the same version on other discs."(sherlock holmes and) the deadly necklace" dates from 1962, although it neither looks it nor sounds it. some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios. not that hammer hasn't turned out some really schlock stuff, but where christopher lee was concerned, they usually did a better job. the print a direct transfer from a rather worn 1:1.33 copy in black-and white. the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color, and the snipped ends of the film's aspect suggest it may originally have been 1:1.66 or more.the film is set in the early 20th century ¬ñ not improbable, since holmes was still working then (and didn't actually die until 1957). however, the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story. it involves an egyptian necklace, and professor moriarty shows up as a world-famous archaeologist as well as the prince of crime. the plot is melodramatic and banal.the biggest defect of this film is that ¬ñ for whatever unfathomable reason ¬ñ hammer filmed it in germany. it was nonetheless filmed in english. it was then dubbed in german and then re-dubbed in english. so what you hear isn't lee nor any of the other original actors, but a bunch of unknowns ¬ñ not that, outside of lee, i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors. this is too bad, since lee (see his "hound of the baskervilles") makes a quite decent holmes. as it is, his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no raisins nor cinnamon.the music for this film is primarily jazzy, in a possible attempt to be "period". too bad nobody thought of ragtime. as it is, the music doesn't relate to what's happening on the screen, and often is at odds with the action.the other film is "(sherlock holmes and) the speckled band" from 1931, starring a young raymond massey. the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the 1962 effort, and in fact a bit better. massey makes a quite respectable holmes, although he certainly doesn't own the r√¥le in the way rathbone did and brett does. the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers. the acting ¬ñ as is true of many films of this period ¬ñ owes a lot to the post-victorian stage and to silent films.it should be noted that, while "the deadly necklace" is available on dvd by itself, "the speckled band" is available only with the former film.there is very little else to be said of this film. the settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriages) and the 1920s (electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone). taken altogether, it's an interesting curio and a sufficient inducement to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with "deadly necklace" only.

creakiness and atmosphere this film has, but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed. raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes, almost comically so in early scenes in his bathrobe, which he trades in for a laborer's garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr. rylott (lyn harding). what wasn't clear to me was why rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters dead. if as in the case of helen (angela baddeley), he didn't want her to run off to get married, he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatched.other curiosities abound as well. after setting an early wedding date with helen, the fianc√©e is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture. the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet stoner's death provides merely a diversion, and what could have been an interesting murder tool, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstanding.athole stewart competently portrays holmes' aide dr. watson, though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea. as rylott, lyn harding is sufficiently menacing, a trait that would be put to good use as holmes' nemesis professor moriarty in two later films - 1935's "the triumph of sherlock holmes" and 1937's "murder at the baskervilles".with repeated choppiness and an unsteady camera, it's surprising that the story line isn't more disrupted than it is. it's integrity is generally maintained, even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps. i guess that would be my main complaint with the film, as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp.

this show demonstrates the depths to which uk tv pre-watershed drama has sunk. with these dull scripts, mediocre acting, poor plots, awful dialog, one is forced to watch a dvd of any old er episode to see excellent hospital drama.none of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act!if you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style tv, this is the show for you. personally i like something with more meat on the bone. sadly as with all other uk licence payers, i'm funding this dross.

may 2nd: someone clicked 11 nos, and then proceeded to do 15 more on my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey!may 1st: as i write this, i'm still very much under the impression of what must be the funniest thriller i've ever seen. i've got a major case of the giggles, but i'll try and calm down. (it's kind of hard to write when your nose spills snot and the mouth ejects sporadic drool onto the keyboard.) a pair of young women who just returned from a vacation take a ride on a shuttle bus. a couple of young guys join them. but the bus isn't really a taxi service: it's a kidnapping vehicle. (don't snicker!) its driver has been part of an organized "white slavery" gang who snatch young women from airports, and they've been doing it for five years. (don't laugh.) five years on the same airport, without the police or even the fbi ever getting any wind of it. (no giggling, please.) apparently, dozens of women go missing on in the same exact place for years and years - and yet no-one notices a trend. is the fbi that incompetent? the world of "shuttle" seems to consist of three types of people: easily kidnappable blonds, dumb/comatose/invisible fbi agents, and omnipotent psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blonds with tattooed behinds).the driver has barely stayed alive on this one mission, and yet he's done this for - i repeat - five years, without being killed or losing one of his limbs. (stop laughing...) did i mention that the driver is immortal? need i mention it? we all know that movie psychos have immortal dna. you can stab them, bounce them against the walls of a bus repeatedly, caress them softly with a hammer, prick nine-inch nails into their ears... hell, you could stick a hand-grenade into the average hollywood psycho's mouth, and he'd still escape with only minor scratches. no, the driver is not satan or even a minor demon, but just a regular hollywood psycho with better survival abilities than the biggest, meanest sewer cockroach.the basic plot outline: a guy loses all the fingers on one hand in a silly scene. (a magical bus that reads and obeys minds!) the passengers try to escape. they fail. they get hurt. they sulk. they argue. they try to escape. they fail. they get injured. they argue. they try to escape. they fail. they get injured. they try to escape. they fail. they try to escape. the kidnappees manage to snatch the gun from the driver! alas, they do not kill him because the golden hollywood rule of gandhi-like pacifism prohibits them from doing it. (no giggling.) one of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang! (stop laughing.) he is played by an actor who studied in the rob zombie/john travolta school of over-acting & silly mugging. he threatens rape. later on, one of the gals hits him with a crowbar over the head, about a dozen times... very hard. only seconds later does he regain consciousness. yep, he survives. (immortal, remember?) he gets killed a little later. (no idea how, though! he is not supposed to be killable.) the kidnapees argue. they try to escape. one of them escapes! alas, the psychos are just far too god-like in their powers not to re-capture their prey. the game starts all over again: the passengers try to escape. they fail. they sulk. they stare into the void. they get hurt. they try to escape. they fail. they get hurt...you get the picture.frankly, i believe that a drugged, heavily disorientated, inebriated snail would have escaped these nincompoop captors with ease. there were so many opportunities. at one point these bumbling psychos (remember: five years!) even send one of the kidnapees into a grocery store! she leaves a message to the police. however, yeah... you guessed it: this fictional fairy-tale u.s. city has no police.and just as you thought the movie couldn't get any dumber - not even if luc besson and brian de palma joined forces to lend a hand with the script - it does. the girls are kidnapped in order to be sent to some remote island(?), and this is achieved by transporting them as cargo. apparently, this fictional america has no fbi, no police - and no border customs either. it does however have immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. one blond had her billionth chance to kill the driver, and yet she failed. how is it that victims in these dumb thrillers never try to finish off their immortal adversaries once they have them down on the floor and injured? i guess i answered that one myself: they're immortal! so why bother trying, she must have thought...so why was one blond gassed to death and the other one boxed and shipped alive (complete with a kitty-litter box, and the funniest photograph since demi moore's primary school pictures)? could it be the tattoo? i think they killed the prettier one, but that's just me. was her tattoo that ugly? could it be that i don't care? why should i search for logic in a movie made by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? besides, how can i even think straight when i'm laughing so hard half the time?!naturally, this being a 21st-century horror/thriller, the mobile phone doesn't work... perhaps this invincible gang control not only the fbi, the police, and the customs, but satellites in space too.do i have to spell it out? there are far easier ways to kidnap people. and far more intelligent people who should be making movies. give an idiot a camera and he'll lay an egg every single time... that sort of answers the eternal riddle of which came first: the egg or the bird-brained director.

waste of 1h45 this nasty little film is one to avoid, its like a cheap badly plotted cross between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap, why the writer wrote this is obvious..he has no soul and did it to try and me some money. the twists were obvious, when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and didn't etc.. only good thing about it is i've discovered 1 new actress worth watching..peyton list, don't watch shuttle though, there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world. spend your time more wisely watch good films, do some exercise, cook a nice meal..anything but waste your time on rubbish like this

just saw this film at the fantasy filmfest berlin. i am not impressed.as far as the story goes. too girlfriends return from their mexico vacation. while waiting for their luggage they get to know a couple of boys, who then take the last and of course wrong shuttle bus to the city. on board is also one other older man, so weirdly portrayed that you instantly guess that he is one of the bad guys. the other one is the driver.the shuttle takes them into industrial wasteland and then one after the other goes done, a little blood, some cut of extremities, some violence, mostly playing with the fear of the girls in the end after some ups and downs, heres and there's, some not too new scary moments, everyone is dead but the driver and the girls. the girls end up in some garage, where one of them is killed, after confessing that she had slept with the other girlfriends boyfriend. the other girl, which is the conclusion, is sold by the left-over kidnapper (yep, weirdo got killed) in some cargo box to asia (a freight harbor being the final picture.) first. story. tons of loopholes, questions you ask yourself, loose ends, and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. i can't see how such a unprofessional looser is supposed to have abducted dozens of women (as is indicated by a drawer full of drivers licences...aha) second. acting. mediocre at its best.third. scare factor. ok. but i am bored by torture as a means to nothing but itself. trade with humans could be a good reason for a horror flick, but it's not used as one, just as a background.fourth, music and sound. some nice tries, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, warehouse garage, and truck sounds have not been really explored. music? would have been worse without it, but apart from that. some pseudo moving synth string theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination. ok, i guess.verdict: avoid it!

"shuttle" is/was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way i ever could imagine. this movie has lost its story, if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. all the next scenes are totally out of proportion. the driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun - knife etc.. even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box. but what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage. i really felt sick and misled when the movie ended. it could have been such a great one if the story was far more better. in my opinion even a kid would make a better story. and why shipping the girl with water and food. i quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through. and when the movie reached its almost admirably sick over-the-top final twist, i had completely given up (better say "throw-up). the worst thing about shuttle is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse. maybe writer/director anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time. think the better he'll move to a different genre. i keep my fingers crossed. but from now on i will read the comment on his future movies first before looking. a waste of time.

this is about as stupid as it gets.a classic case of two-dimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation. it reminds me of a scene in "scary movie" where carmen electra flees from the killer. there are two signs, one marked "to safety", the other one "to sure death" (i am reciting from memory).and just like in scary movie, the characters always run into the direction marked "sure death". why oh why did the girl start the fire in the teller booth and hold the door shut ??? did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy? why oh why, after cutting and overpowering the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out? he was running over their friend and killing him a minute before, yet they have scruples ?? why oh why a hundred things more ... if this movie were a road, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. everything is so far-fetched, it's starting to physically hurt at times.add mercilessly overplaying "actors" and a small budget to that and here's what you get. looking at the rating and the comments, i get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie.the one thing missing really, is the infamous red toolbox from "while she was out" - a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.

this movie is stupid, made by stupid people. the plot i suppose works well enough for a horror movie, but the actions these characters take is insanely stupid! like, incredibly non-sensical stupid to the nth degree! basically the whole movie consists of these 4 idiots being captured, repeatedly, despite having many, many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor. it does not make one lick of sense and is not entertaining whatsoever. stabbing yourself in the eye is more is more rational, and probably more fun than watching this.****spoilers**** the ending is hilarious!! the only good part of the movie! i nearly died laughing at the end! that whole stupid movie, and it ends with the dumb girl getting shipped off in a crate to white slavery in asia!! hilarious! i thought it was a totally awesome ending to a really sh!tty movie.

i hate guns and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in 'shuttle' happen to you or close ones and you find a gun, you shoot your attacker. three times. five times. whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. i think even god would say, "good call." in a very 'hostel'-type film, but more realistic ¬ñ as this really could happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, that is ¬ñ 'shuttle' was a decent film, though on the long side. a few good shocks (always call aaa even just to change a tire), basically just one surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. and aside from the typical "tie him up" instead of the previously mentioned shooting him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. getting past those, it's enjoyable for what it is. basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from mexico home (wow, that's original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. and after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene, they enter a "too-good-to-be-true" half-price shuttle ride. clich√©d jocks, previously introduced, con their way on the shuttle, to join what appears to be alan ruck's stunt double from 'speed.' from here, it's obvious what happens (i did mention it was a 'hostel' knock off) but still, i didn't find too much horrible, yet nothing spectacular. though, it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted, i would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.

the beginning was decent; the ending was alright.sadly, this movie suffers from complete and utter shallowness of the characters, unrealistic confrontations/fight scenes, lack of anyone intelligent outside of the shuttle. this makes for an awful middle screenplay. stuff to look for: overly obvious foreshadowing, fast-healing cuts, overly smoky fires, fun seatbelts, delayed reactions.i did give it a 4, not a 0, because the start of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development. the relationship between the main, dark-haired girl and her fianc√©e is touched upon briefly, and the placement of the blond friend's impact on that relationship is present, though awkwardly so. the business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and decently done, though, as another commenter pointed out, not unexpected. ~viper~

i had a hard time sitting through this. every single twist and turn is predictable. you're sitting there just waiting for it ... waiting for it ... and yes, there it is! just as you predicted at the very beginning of the movie. or 10 minutes out. et cetera. smart writing? no. torture porn? no, there's no nudity. other reviews calling this torture porn are most likely written by people on heavy drugs. unfortunately there's no torture and no nudity (yes, no nudity).there's no suspense at all in this "thriller". the only good part about this movie is the ending, but i'm not going to spoil that.i'm giving it a 2/10. a 1/10 would be a horrible b-movie. this movie had better acting.

brainless film about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport getting on the wrong late night shuttle bus and ending up in a whole world of trouble. great twists and turns are totally, and i do mean totally wasted, in a film with a plot so incredibly stupid as to defy description. what is going on in a general sense is okay, i mean the idea of a guy kidnapping unattended girls for nefarious purposes is a good one. the problem is that the details are so beyond belief that i would be shocked if you don't turn off the film in utter disbelief. gee, a guy who is suppose to be taking you home doesn't go any of the ways you know, and you stay on the bus? it get worse from there, think of every bad choice and this film has the characters make it, even to the point where they could just walk away, but never do. whats annoying is that some of the twists and turns might have worked if there was something intelligent before it, but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this film. okay, maybe there is, the end, the end is clever. the end is the sort of thing that should freak you out. it should be the "oh #$*@!!!!" moment and become a classic of horror cinema. instead it just lies there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. one of the most brainless films of the year.

perhaps spoiler !! well, i ve seen it at the film festival in cologne and i have to say it s ridiculous ... sorry author and writer and ...whatever but it is the worst try making a good movie i ve ever seen ... if u ve got 5000 times the possibility to get away from your enemy and u don't do it .... its getting boring ... there are szenes in the movie witch gives u the impression that they are forgotten e.g. a szene in front of a security cam, they are asking for help and a somebody sees it and calles the police ... than there is a cut and .... nothing ??!!! ... the killer gets a shot in his head and 50 secs later he is behaving like nothing happened ... no its no zombie movie ... and finally the final ... the big end which we were promised .... hmmmm, lets say take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best endings in history so badly that everything goes wrong .... im not going to vote "1" because the actress is beautiful ... ;)

"shuttle" is an indie thriller about four young adults who get a ride late one night on a shuttle bus from the airport to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath.although some of the sequences of scares and it's unconventionally interesting plot work, some aspects just don't. the bad dialogue and unlikeable characters gives a good reason to not care for them. but, often the suspense works and asks you the question of "what would you do?" and usually what you would do isn't what these idiots on the shuttle do. if you're expecting a mindless, bloody horror film, you'll be mistaken. this is a film that causes you to use your mind, but, unfortunately, not until the end.four out of ten.

ok this will contain spoilers. now i have never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative/feed mix up at the elephant enclosure in the zoo! it has more plot holes than moth eaten lace and as for the 'realistic' plot line. well sexual slavery is a dreadful and very real world wide problem and this pile of bilge utilises this plague as a plot device to titillate and tease, shame on everyone involved for that piece of questionable judgement. but back to the film, if you were going to kidnap people from an airport, some of the most secure and camera happy places in the modern world by the way, then why plant a stoolie on the inside of the van who does bugger all until the plot needs a twist. just wait until you are out of the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive calmly to the warehouse and kill the guys, job done. on the passengers side, on at least three occasions the good guys have the bad guys incapacitated and are armed, waste them! once in a movie it can just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the bad guys skull, but come on three times! and after he's killed most of you. also the guy is willing to put down the gun to stop a scarred cheek but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be cleared up with $20 dollars worth of drugs. i could go on and on about the amount of holes in this but i won't waste any more of my time. suffice to say that i have rarely been so insulted by such a dreadful piece of drivel and as for the real problem of sexual slavery, girls go voluntarily to new 'jobs' in distant lands and are abused, raped, and often killed by the gang master who meets them off the boat/plane and takes their passports and freedom. this s**t is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this! do not waste your time!

seeing the names of the starring actors (statham, snipes and phillippe) i thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting. instead all i got from it was not just boring 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen, and hearing tons of lame and shabby "bad cop" phrases.the main problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story to begin with. and when you have that, than no one can help you, not statham, not wesley snipes...not even john mcclane could save this movie :-) it could be cool for the kids, if they aren't over 12 years of age, because they don't care so much about the story, and there are some big explosions in the movie.

those people,who told me"this movie is good"-shame on them!this film is for an audience,who has no problem to watch everything{especially when it's all about tough guys,guns,chasing&heists}.i 'd compare this movie with"the inside man"{the same loss of time}. i'm tired of copy and paste movies.and i'm discontented,but what can i do?fans of that types of movies are much more.... if you want to watch good movie from that type ,i will recommend to you "lucky number slevin". i'm not mean, i just dislike this movie{weak actors,weak script,weak action}.probably someone else will like it.many people-many tastes.however for me"chaos"is tasteless!

frankly i'm amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews. i'll be completely honest and say that the only reason i even got through it is because of ryan phillippe, and not for reasons particularly connected with his abilities as an actor, though i think over the last years he has proved himself to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990's indicated.as far as action/suspense movies go, this movie fails in nearly every respect. the acting is ok, i guess, but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense, a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to chaos theory, as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually 'clever' - but then again, judging from other reviews, some were. don't be fooled: the script is a boring, derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it. wesley snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film, and statham is a thoroughly dull actor.not recommended.

this is the award that made me lose all respects for the hugos.if such a "distinguished" panel can't see or care about the obvious story-telling problems of battlestar galactica, then what worth is their award? the answer: not much.award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, neither of which are in evidence in bg, in this episode or any other that i've seen.shooting in drab video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. shaking the camera is not "creative" it's vomit-inducing and lazy as can be.all bg has shown is how corrupt most award-giving "academies" really are and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of pr money.

it may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946, but the movie is now a bit boring. i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing, and it was very predictable: i mean, we know from the beginning of the movie that welles is the nazi war criminal, and i'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end.not worth watching. it's sad that welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career: kane, ambersons, and a touch of evil.

get shorty was an excellent film. it was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. be cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. john travolta as chili palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. he plays it like he's a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a shylock. uma thurman, great in nearly every role she's ever played, comes off as strained and confusing. is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? the chemistry between her and travolta is strained and uncomfortable. other than that, just add every movie clich√© you can think of. a well-educated rap producer by cedric the entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in christina milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in vince vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by stephen tyler. the only funny part was the rock, who invents his own new clich√© as a gay samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. probably the biggest crime is the plot: it makes no sense. get shorty was clever with chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. but this film tries that with about a million different characters. and even chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. fans of get shorty be warned: this is a very different, very worse movie.

blindingly stupid guff from the formerly talented john hughes, who'll soon be making a film with the sperm from 'look who's talking' if his stars get any younger. he recycles the 'home alone' formula yet again to produce this idiotic comedy, in which a baby makes his way around chicago while inept kidnappers joe mantegna, joe pantoliano and brian haley try to catch him, along the way enduring much tiresome slapstick. if mantegna and pantoliano can't find a laugh somewhere in your movie then you're in trouble, but the laziness of the movie is most glaring in the scenes where crowds of people fail to notice a baby crawling around on the pavement. utter nonsense.

this was painful! recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper, this british-belgian co-production from 1977 (could've fooled me, it looks ten years older than that at least) is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half-hour mark, consider yourself a trouper. the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst, which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn't really there. harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i've seen, with the obligatory 'trippy' moments (especially where the animation of the brainiac-type subtracto character is involved) that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated. the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored. as for adults, stick to jonathan swift's original novel.

peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film "on her majesty's secret service" (considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series). other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like "gold" and "shout at the devil", both adapted from wilbur smith novels. "gulliver's travels" is an odd one on his list of films; it seems strange that a director of hunt's style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind. a half-live action/half-animated retelling of jonathan swift's classic satire, the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made, and in all honesty it simply doesn't work. and there's not a damn thing that hunt (with his usual eye for fast-paced action), or star richard harris (who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles) can do to rescue this one.lemuel gulliver (richard harris) is a brilliant medical student living in 17th century bristol. his father (norman shelley) wants him to go to london to make his fortune; but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called the 'antelope'. during a voyage, the 'antelope' is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef. the ship sinks and everyone is lost, apart from gulliver¬Ö. who finds himself washed ashore in the kingdom of lilliput. when he comes round, gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small humans, no taller than his toe. to them, he looks like a giant. they persuade gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an adjacent island. but gulliver doesn't like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation, so he makes plans to escape¬Ö.harris is left to carry the entire film here. his first couple of scenes involve other actors, but once he is shipwrecked in lilliput he spends the rest of the film striding over knee-high sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts. the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time, but it certainly hadn't been done a lot. a few disney movies like song of the south, so dear to my heart and pete's dragon had tampered with the idea, but it was still pretty much in its infancy. "gulliver's travels" is not an especially well-animated film, but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon co-stars are at least competently done. occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins (there's one scene where we learn that lilliput has gone to war with its neighbour because of eggs !?! - and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things). but at its heart, this is very much a kids' film and the satirical overtones are barely dwelled upon. everyone involved has done better things during their career ¬ñ "gulliver's travels" might fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but apart from that it is a forgettable and underwhelming experience.

if you think hannah montana or the suite life are at the bottom of tween sitcoms then you've obviously never watched icarly. icarly is without a doubt the worst show i've ever seen. from the lifeless acting to the low budget sets the show reeks of cheapness like last week's chinese takeout left to simmer in your overheated car.the show revolves around a pretty, perky, and "supposed to be" funny girl named carly, as she and her friends make a live web show called icarly. carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs some counseling or something, because he's a few cells short of a brain.the plots of the shows are highly ludicrous and unbearably annoying. but having to watch carly and her friend, sam, do their little icarly show-within-in-a-show is even worse. they basically show weird pictures and stick things up their nose as the laugh-track plays over and over. i mean seriously, every two seconds the laugh track seems to come on for no reason.so, what's the point of this review? you may ask. just to ridicule icarly? well, yeah, but i'm also warning you to beware of this show. because seriously, if i had to choose between watching icarly and barney? no questions about it, i'd choose barney.

i... no words. no words can describe this. i will try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives into their toasters... after watching this show.this... cosgrove person... her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance upon the nest of highly agitated insects. perhaps i exaggerate. however, i have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show.the characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun on any day of the week. though heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them act like fools on the cheaply built sets, i have no doubt that it will happen eventually.the main plot of this *belches loudly into the faces of the actors* is that of a foolish girl who hosts a live weekly web-cast on the creatively titled icarly.com with her brainless friends, one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn't afford. her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brother.i haven't watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer, or perhaps a cold, but some of the plot points i have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator, the doorman of the apartment almost dieing, and the world's fattest priest coming for a visit. no, really.avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma. if you do decide to watch it, laugh when the laugh-track tells you to, as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long. the show receives a one star rating because the imdb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers.

im hoping this was made before half past dead and exit wounds because it was rubbish, seagal wasnt to blame it was down to the crap directing when the few action scenes took place. the plot was also confusing and basically just felt rushed out, maybe it was shelved and released to capitalise on seagals newer films??3/10he's not through yet, bring on under siege 3 and loose some weight!

this has got to be the worst steven segal movie i have ever watched (even worse than eco-piffle like on deadly ground & fire down below). i'll start with the good points..., it's got stylish direction for a dtv movie and has wonderful scenry... that's it! the story dosen't really go anywhere, it's just an array of well staged set pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys (the body count can easily match tarantino at his bloodiest!). the plot is needlessly complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are. the acting (i use the term loosely) is mediocre at best, seagal's usual one constipated expression and wooden acting i can take but the others especially the brits were down right terrible.what's in the package? why are bad guys after it? is seagal being set up?who gives a s***!when i rented this movie at my local blockbuster (once i'd paid) the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the shop i could have picked! (i felt like punching him till my arm went numb)anyway, i haven't seen half past dead or out for a kill yet and i daren't go back for more humiliation at my store, but they can't be anyworse than this turkeythe soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip - it just gave me a suuden urge for half a dozen asprins.all in all this is seagal at his worst! the guy who's gained about 100ibs and looks well past it, he's a guy who just doesn't no when to stop, he should retire gracefully now! and have a go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something.my rating 2/10 (1 point for scenery)

when you watch a seagal movie, you expect good action. you expect fighting, not just a lot of shooting like in this flick. and: you expect a rather simple story. ok, i can live with a more complex story even though it's a seagal movie. but this one, this is, i don't know what to say. it's very, very confusing indeed. at the end of the movie, i had major problems figuring out what had happened. and i know i'm not the only one. the story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what's happening in the movie. there are many people in the movie, people change sides all the time, and it switches locations too often. terrible. i just don't understand why it looks like seagal is making a sort of sequel to this one.

the foreigner is a straight-to-video steven seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in march, 2003, an intention which was reportedly reversed when seagal's prior film (half past dead) tanked at the box office. according to some reports, the film had a lavish $20 million budget, including location shoots in warsaw and paris, and was completed as part of the studio's obligation to a two-picture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of exit wounds seemed to indicate that seagal still had a solid following.despite the size of their investment, sony screen gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie. it is nearly incomprehensible. what am i saying? it is incomprehensible. i don't think i understood what was going on at all, except in the very broadest terms.seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy. other mysterious guys try to stop him. other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him. other really, really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff, all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out. the intended recipient's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. because he is a self-proclaimed "consummate professional" who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband, seagal at first defies the wife, then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas, as well as from her husband.many people have mysterious, cryptic conversations. many people blow each other's brains out. some guys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result, so the audience sees somebody die, but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill. allegiances shift often, adding further mystery. or should i say confusion?i don't know who was on whose side, or what anybody really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition. at the end of the movie, i just sat there thinking, "that's the end? what the ...?"i couldn't even figure out the credits. imdb says that aussie actress kate fischer (from "sirens") was in this film, but i'll be damned if i know where. either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project. she could have found some activities more beneficial to her career, like having unnecessary surgery, ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines, or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry.seagal used to be a pretty fair hand-to-hand combatant, but the action scenes didn't manage to redeem this film at all. seagal is in his 50's now and is a very large man, so he is reduced to a mimimal level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a knee-length coat to hide his inchoate brandoesque girth. he might even get a little winded removing the wrappers from candy bars, although that's understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girth.steven seagal seemed to be making a comeback with exit wounds, but if his last film was half past dead, this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half.

i've watched a lot of tv through the years. so much, that when i start seeing new shows that basically seem like reruns of old shows, i get insulted. luckily, i am not too sensitive because all "hot properties" does is updates the cast (meaning make them sexier)of "designing women" and drops them in new york city instead of georgia.the jokes are more tv-14-ish, but it does not make the show any better. the only thing that this show has proved is that nicole sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like "my mother the car" a classic. her comic talents remind one of a modern day lucille ball--only funnier. unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy which might be good for some brainless soap, but they just aren't funny.fred

this movie is so bad there are not words to describe it. if i got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this. the plot is so dull and unimaginitive it is not even worth mentioning. the best part of the movie was when the credits roled and i got a chuckle out of knowing the lead actors name was james bond iii. just trust me and stay far away from this trash heap!

absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash, and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in english class. this is literally one of the worst films i have ever seen. it totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present, so the story is just really really dull. thank god the 80's are over, and god save whatever man was actually born as "james bond iii".

for me, it just didn't seem like gi joe at all. when i watched it as a kid, i just didn't care for it. in fact the part i liked best about this one was the opening credits. they change so many facts around and turn the story around as well. cobra commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptile people in antarctica or somewhere that is frozen. though i always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here. there is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie, but for me it just ruins what i watched the series for in the first place.

i speak badly of g.i.j.:t.m. mostly because i think it lacked something that g.i. joe had. yes it had something that g.i. joe didn't have like celebrity cameos by don johnson, and burgess meredith but i think g.i. joe: the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the g.i. joe tv series had. most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now. it's a good movie but i wouldn't say that it was the greatest movie in the world i.m.h.o. :)although violence is what g.i. joe was built on i'd say that serpentor striking duke in his chest wasn't the very best way for charlie adler's character to go out. neither was seeing golobulus remind cobra commander why he was chosen to lead the cobra forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what cobra-la felt was rightfully theirs.it wasn't the best way for the g.i. joe series to go out but it's better than nothing. :)

i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was: 1) whether to show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police is (i surely could add various adjectives here, but i think my point on this is clear). 2) whether to show how a twisted-minded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers? 4) or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie¬Öthis was one of those movies, that in a way - did not disappoint me. from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award, and surprisingly enough ¬ñ this was consistent throughout the whole time. it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end ¬ñ and i was not disappointed there either. was it a complete waist of time? yes. which raises your question ¬ñ why did i watch it throughout? well, i was trying to fall asleep, and i thought this was a great candidate for that, but unfortunately i had too much coffee before that¬Ö

only in the hollywood audiovisual fiction world could anybody, including fbi agents, be so unbelievably stupid. the good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything they're interested in, answer phones, go up stairways, all in search for a demolition expert who's out to get everybody. oh yes, and then we get the hollywood supervillain. he can be shot, even if he's got a vest on, and then fall down a long flight of steps and then still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. every clich√© you can think of in suspense movies were used. i only watched it because yuki amami is so hot. oh,,,,but yes, it's great to see how morally superior this fbi agent is, when she's pretty certain that there's a bomb in an opera house, and she doesn't sound the alarm. who writes these scripts????????????

well now, here's the thing - for this movie to work, you'll have to accept the following - a woman who's murdered is alive again at the end of the movie, a detective stops interrogating the dead woman's fianc√©e because a newspaper reporter asked him not to, and that same reporter, smitten by a good looking blonde hauled into night court for suspicious behavior, winds up getting married to her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook. are you following me on this? i can't tell you how many times i paused and rewound the picture to repeat scenes that just didn't make any sense. in the end, the blonde (claudia dell) and the reporter (richard hemingway) remained married, but i have no idea how they came to that decision. in fact, i can't figure out how the film maker came to the decision to make this flick. oh i suppose there's some entertainment value here for just the sheer nonsense of it all, but it would have been nice if even a couple of the pieces fit. still, i'm not ready to add this one to my top ten worst list. i think that night club scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it. but why was it in the movie? i just don't know.

this film was actually shot and made in 1987 but it didn't hit the theaters until 1990. as i watched this film i could see the good intentions that it had but i'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work. story takes place in california in the 1890's and some italian immigrants who own vineyards are told they have to leave their land so a railroad can come through. dennis hopper plays william berrigan who has offered money for the land but has been turned down. giancarlo giannini is sebastian collogero and he is to proud to leave and asks the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land. berrigan grows impatient and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to vacate. these thugs are headed by a man named andrews (burt young) and he doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who gives him problems. andrews and his men kill collogero one night and his son marco (eric roberts) vows to seek revenge and get the land back for everyone. marco blows up the bridge that the railroad was going to need and they also destroy a tunnel and this sets back the project for several months and berrigan now starts to get heat from other investors. this film was directed by peter masterson and besides "the trip to bountiful" he has at best a spotty career in directing. he's a fine actor but here he seems to be in over his head. this was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and its easy to see that it didn't occur. roberts hairstyle is perfect for the 1980's but this is suppose to be 1890! the cinematographer is toyomichi kurita who ended up being a good cameraman but this was only his fourth film and he certainly had not learned everything at that time. its not a sharp looking film at all and i noticed in several shots during the day that the sun would be glaring off of something and the scenes just don't have the crispness that would have helped the overall look. the script is just a revenge story and no surprises take place during the course of the film. we know giannini is going to get it and it seemed just a matter of time. the cast is top notch and they do their best but the whole film comes across as uninspired. this was promoted as julia roberts film debut but i'm not sure that is correct. she might have appeared in a film called "firehouse" before this.

this was obviously a low budget film. it shows in every scene. what is nice to see is where it was made. a lot of the film was shot in columbia, ca, in the sierra nevada mountains near sonora, ca. some of the film was also shot in jamestown, ca, very near columbia. there is a railroad museum in jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture. "high noon" was also shot in jamestown, as was "back to the future iii".

this was pretty bad. pedestrian work or worse. i don't think it was homophobic, just really bad. if anything it was really amateurish, like when you're 14 and first discover curse words and skin mags.the main point of this movie, the romance, falls really flat. i can't help but wonder if the writers ever had any serious relationships before this movie.plotting and pacing are horrible, going nowhere at all. one minute we're watching these guys catch cheaters, then we're at a gay club, then we're at a date. out of nowhere the girl apparently likes comics, and then they sleep together. none of this feels real, like an elementary school production of shakespeare if hamlet was written by a frat boy.the ending was some kind of creepy over the top revenge fantasy by a loser who got dumped by a girl. unnecessary and actually kind of disturbing.still, you have to watch it. why?as others noted the director's commentary actually is hilarious - what kind of of professional talks about "banging" or "hooking up" with the actresses? dialogue sucked, relationships lacked chemistry. you will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious jackass.

they should make terrorists watch this video as torture, and not just for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy. about a half hour of this would convince even the staunchest fundamentalist to spill the beans rather than sit through even one more minute of this disaster.this movie is awful. i rented it because a friend said it was hilarious, only to find he was talking about the blowhard director doing the commentary rather than the movie itself. i guess if you find unrestrained arrogance funny, you'll like this. it apparently is true that he goes on and on about chicks he's "banged", the most tasteless example being when the lead actress comes on screen.actually cj stacy was the only good part of this movie - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile. this apparently is the only movie she's done according to imdb, i hope she is involved with theatre or indie stuff as i think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production.

this so called movie is horrible! the actors cannot act. there is no plot. i believe they need to start from scratch and film again. i hope that they can correct the acting flaws in this movie. i would like to see the trailer after they shoot it again. maybe there is hope for it. i am not out to hurt feelings but i believe high school kids can do a better job. the wardrobe could have been much better. sorry, but this just did not do it for me. i normally enjoy the trailers from this site but... this one i cannot find entertaining. i hope they take criticism well because i believe they will get much much more from others in regards to this film.

let's see how many ways you can insult my gender: 1. of course girl #1 is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and sounds/looks like a heroin addict.2. of course girl #1 sleeps with the guy on the first date after getting wasted.3. of course the lesbians are butch "germans" who are into s&m.4. this one was actually a surprise. ending the movie on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of characters was sickening. seeing a woman beaten isn't my idea of comedy.5. director's commentary - talking about hooking up with actresses in the movie, just so you know, is crass and incredibly unprofessional.

i was completely mislead by the comments on this film, mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it. expecting this to be a nice run of the mill american pie style film, i was deeply disappointed.firstly the camera work is awful, i don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the actors move close up and far away of their own accord.secondly the scenery! my god i've seen more furnishings in a bird's nest. the club was totally unconvincing with around 3 extras dancing in the back ground at any one time. the flats were bare and lacked personality.thirdly the actors. wow. the director obviously went for the typical "reaper" character set up, a wimpy main character with a gruff "i don't give a f**k" character that takes pot shots at the main. everything the main character said and did was a chore, so much so it made me wince.overall the plot, the supposedly big revenge theme, lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation. the characters acted irrationally and didn't seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. no character had any depth to them, they may as well have been cardboard cut outs walking past the static camera.a truly horrible piece, worse than a first year students 2 minute short for youtube. advice to the director? change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell one copy at a yard sale in ohio.

how many disaster movies can there be before we get tired of them. come on, we can see them on the discovery channel all day long.i agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera. the great predictor's grandson makes a prediction and everybody starts moaning about how he is ruining the family name. the evil mother-in-law convinces the wife to throw him out into the arms of his mistress, whom she wants to meet. can you believe that? the wife wants to approve the new wife! at the same time the mistress' has someone in love with her that doesn't have a wife, but she sends him packing.now, that the soap opera is over, the earthquake appears.the special effects are really good, but the dubbing is bad. that is why i like subtitled films. the actors are all very experienced and have won many awards, so you will get to see some of japan's best in an oft-repeated story.but, the soap-opera story returns with a kitchy ending.

geologist realizes a big earthquake is coming but no one will listen. whats worse is his father in law had predicted the 1923 tokyo disaster and he's been called unworthy to be his successor. of course the big one comes and tokyo is knocked flat.a poorly dubbed japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half. the second half- after the earthquake destroys a model city its an escape drama. there are some nice moments but the film wastes them either by undercutting the action by too many poor miniatures or by having people do unreal things. hokey and not very good it has an ending you won't believe...

remnants of an ambushed army unit hook up with a group of cowboys to fight their way through indians on the warpath. sounds like it could be an exciting western, but this one is dull, dull, dull. it moves like molasses, the action scenes are uninspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photography isn't very good. eastwood, in a very early role, plays an ex-confederate who doesn't like the idea of fighting on the same side as yankees. that's about the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie, but eastwood wasn't experienced enough an actor to pull it off, and his character comes across as petulant rather than angry or embittered. a very ordinary western. actually, a very less-than-ordinary western. worth a look if you're a die-hard eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career. otherwise, don't bother.

first of all, katherine hepburn is badly miscast as clara. she just can't be convincing as the devoted, selfless, rather smarmy wife that the writers have created.but the real weakness of the film is its shallowness in the face of a potentially great piece of drama. schumann's bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder amounts to "oh, oh, i have a headache" and the occasional angry word. suicide? the word is used, but there's no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see him in the mental hospital he's calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic. a superficial treatment. and brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no sign of his gruff humour, his love of tweaking the noses of the establishment, no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women resulting from spending his youth playing piano in brothels. and was clara's long concert career entirely about promoting robert's music, or was she, in fact, a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself, a female pianist carving out a place for herself in a male world? any sort of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none, but this is a standard hollywood, middle-of-the-road approach, particularly disappointing because the real story is so much more dramatic, so much more interesting, so much more human.

this movie is standard goofy sci-fi fare from the 50s. in its favor, the plot does manage to pull off an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves. but come on now, if aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? why wouldn't they just suck it out of a star!?!? the only credible reason for the presence of kronos is a direct attack on earth society, not the mere collection of energy. nothing like that is even intimated; kronos may have been built by a superior race but its activities on earth are the most primitive. the end that the scientist-heroes plan for kronos is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. it amounts to the "reverse the polarity" gambit which has been used so much in bad scifi it has become a joke in itself. low and behold, this causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy. no one in power seems to care about the impact the release of that much energy (which by the film's end includes, among other things, the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surroundings. and unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the surroundings are the suburbs of los angeles. whoops!

i first saw this movie at a saturday matinee when i was very young. i thought it was cool and often thought about it. well i finally resaw it on dvd. it was still very entertaining but in a different way. it has to rank as one of the goofiest, campiest, 1950's sci-fi movies. it seemed filled with stock military footage. the dialogue is stilted and effects are crude. there is one line of dialogue that had me in stitches. the line jeff morrow says while on the beach with the babe. rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends. it is a classic.

i once heard this movie described as either you'll love it or you'll hate it. from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings, i would venture to say that this is true. i am placing myself in the hate it crowd. i have seen some truly bad movies, boring movies, and even low budget movies. this movie is bad on all three fronts.this island earth's exeter (jeff morrow), returns to his sci-fi/b-movie roots as dr. les (minus giant head prosthetic). the doctor and his assistant arnie (george o'hanlon - aka the voice of george jetson), along with les' girlfriend assistant vera, are tracking a meteor. this is the crux of the cast and is almost a double date. les has vera and arnie has his "susie" (synchro unifying sinometric integrating equitensor - aka the computer). lets just say the relationship between george and his robotic maid, rosie, (and his relationship with "susie") is more believable than the cold, clam-like feelings vera has for les (and vice versa). the object of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor, however. it is really an alien art nouveau/art deco energy storage device, which moves around like a 3 legged dog. there is also the little alien "energy" being that controls dr. hubbel (aka, the chief scientist there). the alien is obviously and from the get-go, malicious and evil. is this the kind of science we are handing out? no wonder the aliens from the explorers were afraid of us. from watching some of these movies, we shoot first. there's no need for questions afterwards. the whole movie is synonymous with watching some really boring science experiments, like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery. its not the fact that this is a low budget sci-fi movie or thats its a bit cheesy and outdated. it is really, really, really boring. the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on. that is it. most of the things we learn about what's going on are through monologues and self dictation. now add crappy dialog, cardboard acting and cheap-sets and you have the makings of an ed wood clone (by the way, ed has made some really boring movies as well - please avoid the orgy of the dead). the dialog ... oh, the dialog. jems such as :"..from under 2 miles of ocean ?why not ?! it came through a billion miles in space."or"do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who's probably pulled the scientific boner of all time ?"this movie is obviously trying to pull a forbidden planet, this island earth, magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits, twilight zone. namely, a low budget sci-fi movie (or tv episode) that is compelling enough to get past the technical difficulties and strange situations. at the core, these movies are enjoyable on some level (the story, the underlying meaning or the sheer comical nature of the dialog or situations). this movie has none of that. it is just 90 minutes of boredom. i couldn't even enjoy this on a ed wood level. i definitely recommend skipping this one and seeing one of the movies i mentioned above instead. it is so bad, that if my name was dr. forrester, i would never think of showing this movie to anyone ... except frank maybe.

jeff morrow is leslie gaskell, barbara laurence is vera hunter, and john emory is hubbel eliot. along with some ancillary air force personnel and a comic geek, they are in charge of a super-secret underground laboratory on the west coast. morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but nonplussed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the pacific ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the mexican coast.nobody knows what this colossal, blocky structure is. obviously it's some kind of carpentered artifact because it's all made up of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on top.it turns out that the machine, dubbed kronos, is from some far-away planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy. you see, here on earth, we have learned how to convert matter into energy, but on kronos' planet they have figured out the other half of the equation -- how to convert energy into matter. and now they're running out of energy on the other planet. are you taking notes on this? good.maybe you'll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by kronos' mission. for instance, if kronos' builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why don't they just convert a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to extinguish la's lights? but it's doubtful the writers could explain it either. reversing the polarities of two antenna is described as an "anthropic conversion," which means a "towards-human change", which doesn't make sense. but it doesn't seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter. the diagram that morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction, from positive to negative.there's a problem with kronos' locomotion too. it marches along the coast, threatening "populated areas" (read southern california), but it has no joints in its two or three legs. these stumps just thump slowly up and down, squashing some people. the film doesn't make much of these squashed people. they're shown as mexican peasants, so maybe they don't count for too much. the usaf also drops a hydrogen bomb on kronos -- while it's in mexico, mind you. nobody raises an eyebrow.not much acting is called for and not much is given. jeff morrow has a distinct and resonant voice, great for radio or for tv voice overs. his face is less expressive. he has only one expression, no matter what the situation is -- a tight smile, as if he's having his picture taken at the universal studios tour. barbara laurence had a fine, golden quality when she made "street with no name" a few years earlier. she was a slender seventeen-year-old as richard widmark's wife. here, her grooming and demeanor reduce her to the level of b-movie actress, though she's still beautiful. it's always good to see morris ankrum in one of these movies. he's made so many, i get them mixed up.on the whole, the film comes across as flat, i'm afraid. (there are some nice shots of a b-47 in flight, though.) the sets reveal a low-budget enterprise. that's not necessarily bad in itself, but there's nothing to make up for the barren settings. little tension in the script, no directorial display, and little effort put into the performances.you might get a kick out of it -- a relaxed high -- because this is distinctly unchallenging. it's just that there are so many better films of the genre out there.

some nameless aliens off on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot kronos to rob the world of its energy. they've got a prototype clanking around mexico for openers and if he proves successful more will be sent. it would certainly take a lot of time for just this one kronos to perform that task.for reasons i can't explain the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist john emery who telepathically directs kronos to his first targets. since emery is killed off later and the monster seems to function well enough without emery as a controller, why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre.in any event scientists jeff morrow, barbara lawrence, and george o'hanlon who work under emery aren't fooled a bit about his nature. and of course they come up with a plan to deal with the raging metal giant.kronos is a perfect film for the fifties, the bad guys are never seen they're just out there looking to undermine mankind. it's a perfect film for the cold war. and jeff morrow assures us we'll be ready for them in the future.the players look like they're having a grand old time mouthing as many clich√©d lines the writers could put in the script. i get the impression that kronos is the kind of film ed wood might have done on a bigger budget with a bit more care.

we chose to see this movie as an alternative to the polar express showing at our local imax theater. what a waste of time and money! first, it is not cute. the snowman, at times, looked demonic. other times, he was simply a zombie. he showed no expression or emotions most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy.secondly, santa states in the beginning it's a movie about the spirit of giving. santa and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving? i'm all for a little parody, but this just wasn't funny or entertaining.the idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different. too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flute...not even a "thank you" to santa.the only funny parts of the movie were the "outtakes" at the end of the film. too bad they didn't use them in the movie. it would have been better.

yes.a real stinker. i saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me that this is a great "psychological" movie. this film makes every effort not to be understandable. i was aware that i was in for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutes.i waited since i expected to see something valuable, and most important of all, i paid for this film. the wait was unbearable. after seeing the film, i talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments ( they call themselves under this title ) of turkey this "movie" had recognised as a masterpiece. yes, a masterpiece, but in the category of stinkers.i think that a movie must be self-explanatory. this film is just the opposite. keep away from this thing which calls itself a "movie". burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". rate: 1 out of 10

in the mountains of japan, forlorn young artist sessue hayakawa (as tatsu aka "the dragon painter") paints magnificent landscapes. he prays "divinity" will restore his fianc√©e, whom he believes was changed into a dragon, 1,000 years ago. meanwhile, in tokyo, an forlorn older painter, edward peil (as kano indara) laments not having a son to carry on his family line of artists. when mr. peil sees mr. hayakawa's paintings, he sees a painter worthy to become his "son and disciple." hayakawa also falls in love with peil's daughter tsuru aoki (ume-ko), believing she's the reincarnation of his long lost princess. but, with his love fulfilled, hayakawa loses his ability to paint¬Ö an introduction notes, "'the dragon painter' was originally released in 1919 by the haworth pictures, a hollywood-based production company formed the previous year by sessue hayakawa, a japanese-born actor who enjoyed great popularity in the silent period. the film was ninth of twenty-two features produced by haworth, each of which was tailored to hayakawa's talents and to his stock company of japanese actors." fortunately, a print of this film was found, in france, and restored.the description, "the dragon painter is a fantasy-allegory of love and creative inspiration that is lost when longing is fulfilled," is accurate. "with its production, hayakawa intended to provide a different view of japanese culture to american audiences, avoiding the stereotyping, violence, and melodramatic conflict expected in 'oriental' films of the period." hayakawa was successful in that part of his goal; although, this film probably did not and will not appeal to most viewers, and is not the best example of its intent.**** the dragon painter (9/28/19) william worthington ~ sessue hayakawa, edward peil, tsuru aoki

i saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when i couldn't get to sleep. it didn't help in the slightest. i found myself staring up at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. i could quite happily never see this cartoon again, simply because of that face.now, don't get me wrong - i love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone. but this twisted and terrifying rendition simply is disturbing. it is mainly the cruel laughter, and the exaggerated features that terrify me, and i still have nightmares because of it. please, i urge you not to allow your children to see this. it is far, far too scary. please, i pray you, keep it away.

this movie describes a truly horrific event, to be sure. but it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast. it is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character, as all the emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves. for example, a character is shot at the start of the movie, and you get the clich√©d desperate, "am i gonna make it, sergeant?", "yeah it ain't nothing'", but it plays out like a sketch from a wayans brothers movie (i don't know if they've made the war movie yet) or something starring leslie nielsen.the sergeant played by sean penn reminds me of al bundy from married with children, while fox is the greatest self-deprecating good-guy clich√© you can imagine... thank god he curses and smokes during it.his emotional "noooo!!!" is definitely more suited to comedies like back to the future than so-called serious movies such as this.to their credit, some of the "main" scenes... (without giving too much away, where they actually perform some fairly horrific acts) ...are well done and do make us take the subject matter seriously. but that is in spite of, not thanks to the acting.

the problem with this- and with all vietnam war films- is that they're all too biased. antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of u.s. soldiers were heroes, while prowar films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie. this film sucks. it's time for a movie that is neither prowar nor antiwar, nor liberal nor conservative, but completely unbiased.

i had great expectations surrounding this movie (not as it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1/2, but high enough), and when i saw it on cable, they were all shattered. starting by the acting (poor,almost mediocre, an astonishing waste of good actors and talent) and the story itself: since when does a 5 men squad go out on patrol on a supposed ¬´hot¬ª zone???to suicide??that¬¥s one big mistake, that costs the film dearly. very good actors do very poor acting here, like sean penn, that recently repeated the irritating way of talking on ¬´i am sam¬ª, and michael j. fox, that wastes a good opportunity to beat charlie sheen on ¬´platoon¬ª, performing just ¬´average¬ª. but the most irritating character was diaz (played by john leguizamo, another stupid waste of fine talent by the director), that was a cheesy,scared and insecure kind of person, even more irritating that jar jar binks (yes,you heard it). the battle sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with michael j. fox trapped by his feet on a vc tunnel.mr. de palma has a weak work here, and if it wasn¬¥t for films like ¬´scarface¬ª and ¬´the untouchables¬ª (these ones excellent films), i would consider him a ¬´bluff¬ª director: too much publicity, bad filming.3/10

one of the worst shows of all time. the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for. the fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors??? never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part. every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show. the stories were as unbelievable as the actors. lame would be the best way to describe it. somehow this show makes a slug like ice-t more believable as a cop, and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded.

some folkie friends recommended this, but as a film it's really lacking in originality. i found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes, and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning. however, if you like traditional english/appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. i've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie, with professional musicians filling in for the actors.

i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and no-one had a good word for it.i happen to love bluegrass and country music so it's not as if i'm unsympathetic to the subject matter. but the problem is that at heart it's a very conservative movie- little more than a filmed mills and boon story. a bodice-ripper of the most simple-minded and soppy kind.it's not just that the love story at its heart, that between reece and dr. lily penleric is more than a tad unbelievable. (why any male would be attracted to the nostril-flaring man-devouring lily is beyond me, and frankly, mike harding as reece seems to be just going through the motions).it's simply that the whole movie is too tame and well-mannered for its own good. there is precious little danger, dirt or drama. sure there's a moment of "excitement" involving a school run by lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic (it's just so poorly written and acted). and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolved.as for good old reece kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like eberneezer bumpass?) i ask you! is the ending of this film believable? fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed? i think not...

visually beautiful with some fine music, this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-tv quality. the romance between two characters, which spans a cultural and educational divide, is simply not plausible. of course, from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up, win over the locals, and find true love, but that doesn't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns. this film had lots of promise, which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized. perhaps a nice under-the-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable, but i certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase. i'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.

this was a fabulous premise based on lots of factual history. but the serious lack of character development left us not really liking or caring about any of the characters, especially the musicologist! she did not get any sympathy; she seems like she deserved his own black cloud. the songs were great to a point, but became repetitive after a while.

*spoilers!* when i first saw the preview for this, it looked like a good old fashioned hallmark movie. i love bluegrass music, so i couldn't wait to see it. when we rented the movie, we read the back and it sounded even better. the film was pretty boring for the first half, every now and then a song would be played. then (i'm embarrassed typing this)a lesbian love seen came in. i that ther was something more then friendship between the teachers but i certainly didn't expect nudity and prolonged make out sessions. i was watching this with my mother and i was quite embarrassed, because i picked this movie. but besides that, it was an okay movie. the acting was fine, the actress who played deladis was great. to be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. i don't care to see the movie again but i bought the soundtrack the day after i saw the movie. and there are continuation discs that follow. if i were you, i would skip the movie and just get the music.

as a true canadian, i always avoid canadian movies. however now and then i get trapped into watching one. this one is better than most, which is to say mediocre. it has many of the usual flaws of canadian films...self-conscious acting...an excess of cinematic gimmicks and, above all, the self-effacing canadian habit of using canadian cities as stand-ins for american ones. i mean using the historic metropolis of montreal as a stand in for harrisburg pennsylvania is just short of obscene. i was in a generous mood. i gave it a 4.

first off, i am a huge fan of tolkien, and as one i will base most of my critic on his books.the movie is a standard adventure movie, well made with nifty special effects, nice sound track and fine acting. now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews wouldn't be half this good as they are here.the problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from tolkiens books but then it goes and "hollywoods" everything it can, numerous scenes from the book are eighter missing or changed quite a lot, the characters are changed from the book also, a thing that i think should be punishable ! what the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it, i know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book, and it didn't work here eighter, mostly the motivation of the characters is left hazy at best.as a adventure movie it would rate 7+ / 10 as a adaptation of tolkien it rates 2 / 10i mean honestly, what on earth was arwen doing at rivendell ford ? and as for the comments that this movie "is the best ever" i can only say that eighter you are very young, or you havent seen good movies...peter jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings.

if you haven't read tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! if you have however... after having read the books several times, over many years, i have come to love the characters and story, and feel i know it intimately. i have my own personal vision of the shire, hobbiton and the character-gallery. thus for me the movie was a disappointment. why? it dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline. great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is, is simply ignored. even 2001 special effects can't do tolkien's (and your own) imagination justice. peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible, and i don't think anyone else could have done it better! but the fact remains, i regret seeing the movie. the next time i read the lord of the rings, peter jackson's limited vision will leap forward, not my own.

no doubt about it, rampling is gorgeous -- a classic beauty, here very young. she manages to appear simultaneously sophisticated and poignant. her two male foils act well too. but seen in 2003, the flic is allamerican-trying-to-be-artsy-and-not-be-hollywood-while-shooting-beautiful-sh ots-of-the-french-riviera-and-three-pretty-young-people-in-their-cute-old-ca r. i enjoyed the view (both the actors and the nature) but the movie is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite.

historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences, etc. however, historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history. this film does not. the only scene i actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. he confronts the dangerous intruder with, "i don't remember sending for room service". the main entertainment value is in its badness; i recommended my local video story put it on the "turkeys" shelf.

as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, it's not bad.it's on par with sam raimi's "hercules: the legendary journeys", as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. you'll see the similarities at several points. most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.jack palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best. same for oliver reed. the problem is that their strong performances make square-jawed don diamont's less-than-stellar acting skills seem even more awkward. perennial bit player cas anvar was very good as well, playing a character much like salmonius in the aforementioned hercules.if you enjoyed the low budget swords-and-sorcery movies of the early 80s, you're probably going to enjoy this show as well. it's actually a shame they attached the marco polo name to it. it really has nothing to do with marco's life, contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie.

help! once again, paul schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. i rearranged a vacation so that i could see this "world premiere." what a mistake! why did schrader even want to make an exorcist film? lofty intentions are fine, but if i wanted 2 hours of theological babble, i would visit my nephew's sunday school. father merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. but an exorcist movie needs more! the relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production. who is this movie for? i didn't bother seeing the harlin version, but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrills.the exorcist series has been quite strange. the first film was excellent, but every sequel has been unloved and pointless. why do they keep making them? i suppose schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money. but why should we go?
