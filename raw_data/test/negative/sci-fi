the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra bullock. her picture (from years after this film) basically is the cover art... and the back cover art... and the inside cover art... the same picture. her name is prominently shown on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disk itself. she is the first name in the list of stars. her biography is printed inside the case. this film must revolve around her character, right? wrong! it is her first movie and she plays a minor role. after watching the movie, every role seems like a minor role. the character dog actually displays some personality. less than an hour after watching it, i don't even remember the names of many characters.maybe if i watched it several more times, i could actually figure out the plot, but i don't think it would be worth the effort.oh, wait, i just remembered a funny bit! shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the "doom-cam". looks just like a first-person shooter game. hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.i am generally not a person to be critical of movies, but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen. i kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it.i'm just glad that the money we spent on this (used) went to charity.

this film stinks more than limburger cheese! if you find this at a garage sale, leave it there! i love sandra bullock and yet hate this movie... although ashamed, i do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra bullock is in this at all. they play it up to be "a sandra bullock movie". she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. well everyone has to start somewhere...

i broke my own rule buying this movie from the $5.88 bin at walmart. basically, if a movie has a big star in it, and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. well in the case of this movie, the reason is because it sucked! they plaster sandra bullock's photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait, and it reeled this little fishie right on in. i was thinking of donating the disc to charity, or giving it to the library, but i don't think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie. worst lines: "what do you mean army buddies?" "what do you mean your dad?"

now before i tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. bone eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. i don't know how these movies even get onto dvd. if i saw this in theaters i would get extremely upset. bone eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones. it's the 'bone eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets.first of all i thought okay well the dvd artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy. when i rented it and looked at the dvd label it looked scary. but then when i played it in i could agree on one thing- the title 'bone eater' is better than the movie itself. tell me what's more stupid? a bone eater that just attacks by throwing a bone ate you and you disappear? don't worry that's not a spoiler you see that happen in the first 5 minutes. or is it more stupid that 'bone eater' has a horse? you know what i think is the stupidest? the whole movie.the cgi is awful. yeah i thought the idea of 'bone eater' was creepy but once you see the actual thing you think this is some kind of action movie or just a cruel, mean joke. the film felt longer than titanic and this was half an hour. once the film actually has its moments of suspense it just stops. i admit the acting was not the best but actually decent and that the violence wasn't over-the-top but everything else is a stinker.overall bone eater is a film you can skip. if you like interesting movies with great creatures, great cgi, and suspense 'bone eater' is a film to skip. if you like bad movies no matter how cheesy they are then 'bone eater' will satisfy.

with the exception of the fine rack on clara evans...this show was pretty bad...so why did i watch it? too much coffee, and had to relax before hitting the sack. watching bb change into his lamest big chief outfit, was amusing at best, downright laughable at worst.i could have made a better skeltor and special effects on my dell.boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me, and he's looking more and more like the scarecrow from his tv series days back in the early 1980....the women eye candy need to go back to acting school, although evans size 40 and playing a 17 year old(she's in her early 20s was a stretch)....the sci-fi channel has done better that this...but for us folks that don't get out to the bars much anymore, i guess we have to take what we can get...after all anything that gets you away form cnn, msnbc, and fox coverage of election 2008 these day is a good thing.

yes, thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie. the acting is below-average and the special effects are horrible. in fact, the worst i have ever seen. it is a very low budget movie. there is no way this movie will can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. mr. bone eater was more of a funny creature for me. it could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget. the movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol. i would name this movie the time eater (waster). i am sure you would have a lot of better movies/etc to watch. still watch it if: 1. you have nothing else to watch. 2. you get to watch it for free. not worth renting at all.

i would give this a zero if they had that rating. fun was no fun at all. i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. the others i watched this movie with also agreed. the acting was annoying. i am tired of jim carey's over the top ham acting. the supporting cast was no better. while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way. i actually disliked the leading characters (dick and jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot. a worthless movie and a total waste of time.

this movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i've seen in a long, long while. to be fair, i was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but i was anticipating to at least be entertained. with such low expectations, how could i manage to be disappointed? jim carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. he seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his fletcher reede from liar liar. this new character, dick harper (a.k.a. fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp. if you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character, it is most likely because carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. carrey's outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward--and, ultimately, sad.tea leoni as jane does little more than provide the abbott to carrey's costello. i typically find tea leoni refreshing and underused, but not in this case. jane harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty-five, and it is in that non-specificity that the character of jane becomes uninteresting to watch. she simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie's general theme, which seems to be that... wait, no, this movie has no theme. unless you count "big business is evil" as a theme. i thought that was more of a given.richard jenkins and alec baldwin both deliver believable (though tired) supporting performances, but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing. it's very clear that alec baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister c.e.o. as he puts into eating a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot of lately).slight tangent, but has alec baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit? anyway, take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. this is the one to catch on hbo in a few months. dick and jane are present, but there's no fun to be had.

unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that jim carrey (producing and starring) and brian grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. basically dick harper (carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. that's until the company of dynocorpe sinks and closes down. now dick and his wife jane (t√©a leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. no matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want. so they start robbing a few places. and then they decide to rob the guy that set dick up, his ex-boss jack mcallister (alec baldwin). i think the most laughable bits are when carrey's in the elevator singing "i believe i can fly" and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery, and is speaking with a voice changer (he sounds like a crap robot). okay!

as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism. after all, fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success. after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. the idea that a charming, charismatic, top v.i.p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible. the actors seem confused with the situation as well. of course, the stereotypical, rich, uncaring head of the operation doesn't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder. one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro, obsessed with possessions, the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together, and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able, quite happily, to put a gun to another man's head. jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going. the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work. the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever. carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality. carey shines when he is presented with a strong, daring character (man on the moon, the truman show, ace ventura) which this film never presented him with, despite its best efforts.

part of the movie's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. while this is good for drama, in comedy, we know the pains it need not be emphasized. as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane. it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name, but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line.however, if the movie was retitled to be "the art of the steal" and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal (stupidly of course) would have given the movie a major boost. while, at the same time the movie should show the ceo at least in the beginning to be a crook, so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that. the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind, a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly. a scheming husband character who is that of a wile e. coyote on the road runner would be more funny, including the slapstick comedy. but in this case, a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here. i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie. but since the viewpoint was done wrongly, the robbery part had to be limited.you will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes (during jim carrey's great rise), but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy, that is the part that needs a major overhaul. it can be funnier, if problems were faced more like john travolta's civil action during the downfall. that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.

i thought the movie was sub-par. the acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. the director dropped the ball on this movie. it was not james (jim) or tea. imho it was the music that killed it. there is a scene where things go down hill and jonny cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. after that the movie could not recover. the deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - i even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene. the music kept me from being pulled in to the movie.i say it had potential but was poorly done, i would even say rushed into final production. kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. the theater release was good, i though so after watching it, but the movie release exorcist:dominion was a helluva lot better. same story just different director. same should be done here.

what a terrible misfire. not only the title but the idea is the same as that jane fonda, george segal vehicle of a few decades ago. why? i wonder, someone with the clout of jim carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. he could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. money, money, grosses, christmas. but i'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. i call it uncomfortable because that's how i felt. aware as i was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny. and failing, miserably. it could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the post enron days but no, that would be pointing too high, too risky. what a shame!

a satire about greed and money, what? there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. jim carrey's reign was certainly short lived. he is an unbearable presence on the screen. the insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. he produced this, this "masterpiece" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. "the number one comedy in america" shout the desperate tv adds. of course, jim carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over. if i sound angry is because i am. i spent a sunny afternoon in california, plus, between tickets, parking, flat cokes etc, almost 45 bucks on this thing, starring and produced by mr carry. not anymore, do you hear? not anymore.

oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. it not only is frantically unfunny, but worse, a very good original was trashed in the bargain. jane fonda, believe it or not, actually turned in the performance of her life in that one. even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life. maybe she is just flat good as a crook. any other time, wow, what a waste of time. but she and segal team up beautifully, so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby, catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.because very very very little of that one remains, to this ones horror. nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss..... and uhh........oh my lord, that's it? well, looks like it. it truly is that bad a film.

jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he's a great actor (eternal sunshine, for example).however, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has nothing else to recommend it.even if you do like carrey's comedy, i am not sure you will find this film amusing. i went to see it on a saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. they giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. i think it raised about five genuine laughs.the problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. it can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (i'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.the strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. but these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), i would have done the same. and in my entire 25 years of movie going, i have done that just once before.

see dick work.see jane work.dick and jane are married.they are successful.they have a son. they have a nice house.they have a latino housekeeper.the housekeeper teaches spanish to the son.the son speaks spanish.ha-ha.see dick get promoted.the pompous ceo is a crook.see dick take the fall for the pompous ceo.jane quits her job.oops.see dick and jane out of work.dick & jane turn to crime.as a plot device, they decide to rob the ceo.see the robbery get botched.see dick & jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the robbery.yay. see the end credits.okay, so you've got the plot. beyond that, dick and jane careens from one scene to the next. one barely connecting with the last one or the next one. the whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. jim carrey didn't bother to bring his "a" material, he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing. but heck, when you're getting paid $20 million plus, why bother. tea leoni is frantic. i guess i would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop.there's just something sort of off about dick & jane. carrey and leoni aren't funny and have little chemistry. the script isn't funny. and it's not well-plotted.but it may be bigger than that. the reality of dick and jane is, perhaps, a little too real. maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an enron-like situation, when real-life still lacks a happy ending.

dick and jane harper (jim carrey, t√©a leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.i've always been a fan of jim carrey. it's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. the last one was bruce almighty which was pretty good. he has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. fun with dick and jane proves that he still has it. even though the film was funny, it was still kind of disappointing. it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be. it's worth watching once though unlike most of carrey's movies, it doesn't have a good repeat value. part of the problem is the script. i was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made the forty year old virgin. some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard. if jim carrey wasn't in it, than the film would have been a lot worse.next to jim carrey is t√©a leoni. she's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny. she doesn't match up well with carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance. they should have gone with someone else. the supporting cast includes alec baldwin, richard jenkins and aaron michael jenkins. the latter plays billy harper and he actually gives a decent performance. he wasn't as annoying as most child stars are. alec baldwin was okay and richard jenkins tried too hard to be funny. to be honest, i'm a little bias here. the film altogether was pretty average but i liked it more because of jim carrey's performance. fans of jim carrey should enjoy it but that's about it. in the end, fun with dick and jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable. rating 6/10

there is no "fun" poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants! or the desperate plight of head-shop owners, for that matter! that the richer-than-god brian glazer didn't see the irony of having the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does - rob honest, hardworking people of their life savings - doesn't surprise me! hell, how do you think he got to be richer than god?!in this alleged satire about greed, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the mcmansions, the mctoys, the mcchildren, the mcillegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the mcmansions, the mctoys, and the mcchildren! but the main problem (aside from the revolting bigotry) is the premise: as the former executive of a now-infamous company, dick would be the big scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! no soup kitchens for him! and, raking in high six-figures, you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a gore/lieberman poster!

i rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is booooooorrrring. despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). wondering if the fast forward function on your vcr works? rent this film and put your concerns to the test.

a killer (john karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. detective decarlo (james luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). tracking the killer to his home, decarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.inspired by the crimes of ted bundy before he was caught, killer's delight is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick. director jeremy hoenack has no idea how to pace a film or even make it suspenseful. he does know how to show lots of close ups of the killer wringing his hands though! the only thing this really has going for it is the captured 70s atmosphere (look out for the bathroom wallpaper). well, that and a downbeat ending. the media blasters/shriek show dvd has lots of nice stuff though including an audio commentary by hoenack and karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternate opening.

detective sergent vince de carlo (james luisi) and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer/rapist. can psychologist carol (susan sullivan) help, or will she become the killer's next victim? and what is with the killer's hilarious white dude afro? inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy, "killer's delight" aka "the dark ride" is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much. if anything, it's more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie, as much of the violence occurs off camera. sure, we get mutilated bodies, but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department-especially considering that they are from the aftermath, and not during the crime. those hoping for the likes of "the toolbox murders" or "maniac" will be very disappointed.fortunately, there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get's the tone right, and is quite suspenseful to boot. also, john karlen is quite effective as the killer, though his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle) is more than a bit distracting."the dark ride" is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation, as it lacks the proper exploitation elements, and is dated even by the standards of the time. those looking for a better example should probably turn to "don't go in the house" and a few others instead, as this just doesn't cut it.

i hated it. i hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art. this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid. after the first half hour, i fastfowarded through the dvd version, and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over. i became angered that i had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap. tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art.

i will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.the simple plot is.. well.. simple. i got to the point where i didn't care if they destroy the building or not. if i had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, i swear i would hurl the dvd out the window. and there's also the protagonist. they try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert! sniffing the girls bra, sneaking peeks at her when she's naked, putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps, putting her bra on a blow up sex doll (which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll.. umm)what irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting. in the photo gallery on the dvd, you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint (digitally too).. the film looked a lot better without the effect.. so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy... bah. i could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap..i think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 - 10 minutes. this doesn't compare to delicatessen ( like so many are tryign to do). delicatessen has characters you can get into and like.. these people here just grunt and giggle.lastly, i would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a german impressionistic film liek the old silents. one of the problems with most foreign, especially artsy, films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the 'space' of the scene. it results in the audience not really understanding what;s going on because they don't get a sense of the space of the surroundings.anyway, it's rubbish. the short film on the dvd, surprise, was a heckuva lot better.

i always say, "there's nothing like a good movie". and i must say, this was nothing like a good movie! drab, dull and tedious. it was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. i don't mind the concept of a film without words, (ie: entering a fantasy or dream world), but there has to be something there to capture your imagination, not just empty images, which is what this film is. there seemed to be no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to discern any story. (was there even a story?) you could tell the actors were trying their best, but unfortunately, poor direction sabotaged all the actors' work. it really seemed like a type of cinematic masturbation...only existing to pleasure the director and nobody else. big waste of time.

i had a different experience with this movie - it never got charming, or delightful, or funny for me. one big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the ianguage(s) spoken in the film. another was the lack of choices re subtitles.i found the lack of dialogue annoying, especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was. the wildly inconsistent development of the feeble plot was puzzling. were there characters, or only vague gestures? was there even a plot?on a separate matter, i'm getting prompted to correct the spelling of "dialogue", with the suggested substitute of "dialogue". maybe this movie in its entirety, including the imdb portion, is designed to puzzle, or amaze, but i'm getting more irked than amused.

like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of jeunet & caro or emir kusturica. but have you already seen delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. i thought delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. i don't think it's a worse film than delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch delicatessen again. there is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you. there may be a distant similarity to the films of kusturica, but he's really in a different league, so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on tuvalu.

you know, this is one of those "emperor's new clothes" films. it's like, so off the wall and strange that you're supposed to like it if you're really into film. well, i think that's a bunch of bologna. films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts. some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. i have bizarre dreams too, sometimes, that make absolutely no sense but i don't feel the need to put them on film, expose everybody else to them and call it art. weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it. if other people don't get it, that doesn't make it profound, it just makes it incomprehensible. bizarreness for bizarreness sake, for me, is not good, let alone great, art. and comparing "tuvalu" to "delicatesen" is like comparing "the godfather i & ii" to "the godfather iii"---same genre, not in the same league.

one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far: the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.as nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! the cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. in comparison, the one of the "shining" is funfair! nb: a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera! they are wrong! it isn't the south of france (nice, cannes) but totally the opposite: cabourg & normandy, to be simple the beaches of the d-day! that's why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn't sun!

it seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. some manage to do so with great talent. herv√© hadmar doesn't. on the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very "d√©cal√©" style. director hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. the movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade. what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.

this movie really sucks. this is my second review because its so bad. the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not. i cant believe it was rated r there is basiaclly no violence, no sex, no nudity, no swearing nothing. really crap film.

bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, implausible, bad dialogue... this movies is bad, bad, bad. however, if you want a movie to poke fun at (a la mst3000), this is your movie. i wouldn't suggest spending much money on it, but if you do see this movie, make sure it's with plenty of witty, like-minded buddies.

i saw this on cable. someone had to lose their job for greenlighting this one for air. just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown! savage instinct should be shown in all film classes. it is the perfect template for how to not make a movie. the editing alone is so jumbled you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained (poorly) monkeys, traveling across unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. the audio is often not legible. acting? i can't call anything i saw here acting. reciting? hmmm. can't call it that either. failing? that works. all that being said...it is hilarious! i cannot stress enough that there is not one redeemable factor in this "film" other than the hilarity derived from it's own incredible ineptness. fun, in a strictly masochistic sort of way. watch it...if you dare.

if you like really shocking movies this is for you. the acting is the worst i've ever seen and the story line goes no-where. if you come across this film in your video shop don't even consider borrowing it. the chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie.i gave this movie 1/10 only because i couldn't vote 0. avoid it at all costs.

susan inadvertently stumbles onto a drug smuggling ring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house. the leader of said drug ring, mongo (whom only has one week until retirement) thinking she knows much more than this bubbly blond actually does seeks to make sure she won't tell anyone anything and thus begins one of the more bone headed films that i've sat through.all the actors in this film can't really act in the least. susan makes a pretty ineffectual hero for most of the movie (she'd never escape multiple times if not for the fact that seemingly every one in the movie wants to have sex with her) and she doesn't take the offensive until the last 20 minutes of the flick. when she does she spouts some generic "i have had enough" line, preach on sister, that very thought ran through my mind multiple times when i was watching this my grade: d-

this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. it really does not qualify for movie status. it is very cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. it looked like a home video! i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. it is that bad. i noticed the name from whence this came¬Öasylum¬Öand i will never rent anything with that name on it again!!! when you rent a flick, check to see if it is from this "company." one thing is true though--if you like horribly acted, amateur movies, then you might like this loser. it is absolutely boring and terrible!!! you have been warned!!!

i had to suffer through this movie three times while i was a zombie extra in the director's new movie after sundown. the first time that i saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. i could not take it any more i busted out laughing right in front of the guy. the movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (female nudity) was nowhere to be found. i am a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was just too much for me. the worst part was that i had to watch it so many times. also do not expect the new movie to be any better.

the fanglys is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of christ or something, i mean halloween isn't that important is it? anyway, sheriff pete (burton gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned (co-associate producer john william galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. could it be the fang lady (justin hamilton)? the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows? being the fun sort of guy he is mark (asisstant director & producer robert harvey) convinces his missus kelly (laurie reeves) to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven (josh gobin) found the night before for a halloween party. the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly & she agrees, along with steven & a girl he picked up named camille (natalie woods) & their nerdy friend jerry (tim boswell) they all set out for a night of fun, well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. however they soon discover that the legend of the fang lady is far from the bedtime story many make out...edited, executive produced, written & directed by christopher abram the fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film. the script is very predictable, dull & doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever, in the right hands & with a decent budget the fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't. it moves along at a fair pace but the on-screen 'action' is so poor that it doesn't matter, i don't quite know what else to say other than the fanglys is a really bad film & i can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it. the dialogue is basic, the character's are clich√©d & lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time. there are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage? i'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. oh, if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed, assuming you can actually make it that far of course (believe me it takes some doing).director abram doesn't do anything special. abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish, i can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods. there's no atmosphere, scares, tension, excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good. forget about decent gore, there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm & a pitchfork stuck through someones throat.apparently the fanglys had a filming budget of $2,837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release, & to be brutally honest it shows. what about the retarded guy & his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous? the terrible special effects, the camcorder cinematography & the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through.the fanglys is straight-to-video crap, it has no redeeming features whatsoever & it's low imdb user rating score is fully justified, it's one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock & wishing the thing would just finish.

this film is terrible - honestly. the acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which i usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. of course, before that it has the clich√© "you really believe that? ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged out for a while. the witch's cannibal son was made a retard (i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy, but this film failed at both). it has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad film even worse. heck, the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene, and even that could of been better.honestly, don't even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly don't consider buying or renting this, else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.

yes, it's a sbif (so bad it's funny) classic. with a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. blood looked like watered-down cherry koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the "human" bones, and miss witch had the cheapest mask wal-mart could provide.did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was? most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms, it would be career suicide to have this on your resume. do yourself a favor and watch ebert's video of his colonoscopy instead!

i went into this movie with an open mind. i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. i promised him i wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise. we kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.this "movie" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100. i really don't know how this got distributed. the lighting was poor. i have seen better acting in elementary school plays. there is really nothing positive to say about it.

director john madden, of shakespeare in love fame, gives us another pretty bad film in ethan frome. the plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of starkfield where he learns the story of the local crippled man ethan frome's sick wife and one-time romantic tryst with the maid. adapted by richard nelson from pulitzer prize-winning author edith wharton's novel, this film isn't interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz. still, there are other aspects apart of the film that work - the cinematography is well done, rachel portman contributes a lovely score, and while no one is at their best, liam neeson, joan allen, patricia arquette, and tate donovan work well in their roles. but overall, ethan frome is only marginally worthwhile and is easily forgotten.

john madden's cinematic interpretation of edith wharton's ethan frome falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece. while the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film. madden fails to convey the innocence, and overall tragedy of ethan and mattie's relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale. the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog. zeena (zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the books least sympathetic figure, where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on. the book more accurately describes zeena's tyrannical control of the house and of ethan. the movie just ticked me off. the addition of the fox was pointless, as well as the scene with mattie trying to kill herself. it was just poorly interpreted and done. film mistakes: ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with denis eady, addition of love scene, fox scene, store scene, saying his plans allowed, lack of displays of ethan's inner emotions and thoughts, introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer, let on to much that zeena knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what zeena is thinking or aware of. just too many flaws and poor directing decisions.

although i found the acting excellent, and the cinematography beautiful, i was extremely disappointed with the adaptation.one of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that ethan and mattie decide to kill themselves, rather than go on. this is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledding accident.the character changes in mattie and zenna are almost non-existent. while in the novella they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids.lastly that mattie and ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale.the change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change.neeson and arquette are superb in their portrayals. joan allen was also wonderful, however her character was much watered down from whartons novella.i do not expect films to faithfully portray novels, but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story.overall, i would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed.

let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film. for the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. it seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid. the crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog? uhhhhhhh. ok. overall, a fat stinking 1/10. not worth your time.

i'd heard this japanese flick is edgy, creatively interesting, a "cool new thang" on the asian movie-making scene ... maybe even something as innovative as hideo nakata's "ringu" or chan-wook park's "oldboy", especially the latter.you can imagine my disappointment when, instead, i found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically (though not in a way that a film aficionado appreciates), clich√©-ridden, even sadly silly instead of funny --- on the whole, a very bad knock- off of the "pulp fiction" style.i stopped watching after 30 minutes, when i gave up on it becoming something more than it is.

fortunately, i haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. after watching the first 30 minutes, i became both disappointed and curious.disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - i still don't know why i had been shown the daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue. and also curious, to see what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the ending summary of all this brutality.unfortunately, though the movie was not boring, i didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that i had to watch from the beginning to the end. to my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is kill bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. afterwards i will take the ratings from the cannes film festival with more precaution, as while oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury, it had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale.i am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.

this digital horror film brings us into the micro-budget film genre where the more blood and chicks in distress the better. the story is weak, the acting is respectable and the special effects, well, they're special alright. a quality horror film for the fans that already know what to expect.

jeff leroy wanted to makes fun of scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. the twist is that instead of frail old l. ron hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. his landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. it doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood. "the screaming" was shot very cheaply on video and i just plain ugly. the space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks perpetually mad and has no skin) is alternately a clay-mation miniature and a large scale animatronics puppet, both of which look awful. the acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. avoid this non-scary, pitiful little excuse.

the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. it features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects i've ever seen. the plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to dianetics. this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement. i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film.

bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. the "plot" is about an american mercenary, played by reb brown (in the film he's called a "military adviser" but it's not really clear if he's in the american military or not), helping the army of a latin-american country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. shannon tweed is a "sports equipment saleswoman" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue. that description actually makes the movie sound better than it is, because it's really a stinker of almost biblical proportions. how bad is it? well, shannon tweed turns in the movie's most professional acting job. if that isn't an indication of just what a 12th-rate piece of junk this turkey is, nothing is from mismatched sound effects to a music score that sounds like it's from a 1940s "z"-grade horror flick (and may very well be) to the same footage (i.e., armored personnel carriers going down the same jungle trail) reused constantly to some of the most ineptly staged "action" scenes in recent memory, this laugh-a-minute sludgefest has to be seen to be disbelieved. tweed looks bored, brown looks hung over, and by the time this thing is finished--if you can last that long; i couldn't--you'll know just how they feel.although there are a lot of explosions and gunfights, this can't be considered an "action" picture by any stretch of the imagination. it's boring (there's a scene in the back of a truck where everybody just stares at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" being killed over and over), illogical (when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a government helicopter gunship, instead of breaking for cover they just stand there staring up at it), inept (soldiers and rebels falling "dead" when no gunshots are heard, a gun battle inside a house where combatants standing against walls are machine-gunned but miraculously the walls escape undamaged) predictable (when the "governor" says to offer a reward for brown's capture because "someone" might turn him in, you know exactly who that "someone" will be, and it turns out to be exactly who you thought it was) and just downright stupid (pretty much everything else in the picture). inept, brainless and stupid beyond belief. don't waste your time.

found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. reb brown,(mark hardin), played a military adviser in south america and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. however, mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. in one scene as mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs sandra spencer (shannon tweed),"dead sexy",01. mark and sandra have the extreme hots for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks, with no time for the comforts of a bed. this is a horrible film and not worth wasting the time to even look at it.

first off, i'am a horror fan. but this "tobe hooper" production (come on, the man from the original texas chainsaw and poltergeist !!) was below standards, even for a fan. the acting was not bad at all, some characters were unbelievable, but the leading ladies were ok. the story was something we've seen a hundred times already, without any surprising twist or whatever. never exciting or intense, and do not count on any special effects besides blood splashing up. the scary zombie kids are white paled faces with dark eyes and that is it.. that might have worked in the early 70's but not now. director j.s. cardone didn't do a good job in keeping the suspense, half way thru there is a risk you will fall asleep. my vote is based primarily on the leading acting, but this could have easily have been called children of the corn 8: from the corn fields to the mines... enough said..

the concept of this movie is pretty compelling: zombie children climbing out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the backwoods of pennsylvania. cool. the problem i had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies. the makers could have really spiced this film up with some terror-like imagery a la "the ring" such as stop action, reverse camera walking or stuff like that. when the zombie children are strolling through the woods they look like a bunch of 9 year-olds walking to a playground in west philadelphia. instead of pick axes and shovels they could have easily been carrying baseball bats and gloves. why would i fear these little kids? anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety. also, who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that creepy, run-down house? the moment i opened that front door and looked around i would have said, "mm-hmm. mm-hmm. son, go start the car. i'm going around back to pee on a bush and then we're out of here." totally unbelievable movie. don't waste your time.

wicked little things has an excellent synopsis: empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past; family moves into house and strange things begin to happen; little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy-little-children-things. but that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends. this group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier, and now appear roving the woods (poor make-up) with weapons looking for flesh to eat. oh i get it, this is a ghost-zombie movie. hmmm....while i can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, this just didn't work. what was the children's motivation in seeking to devour flesh? why did they need weapons? did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool/scary movie? i found that after thirty minutes i felt the familiar resignation that i had just wasted my time on another modern crap-fest. while the acting was good, and the setting/cinematography of good quality as well, the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether. a bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents.this movie is not scary, and while i can appreciate the story, perhaps have even enjoyed it if i had read it instead of watched it, i still have to say that wicked little things is more accurately called wicked little turd.

i guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight.this is a morons delight. the worst stereo-types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable. every character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy. lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked.***spoiler*** how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place?

i've seen worse, which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was. the plot is ridiculous: a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage? in a dimly-lit, smoky new york school -- and somehow this clich√©d hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve? are you serious? a day-long hostage situation -- with a wounded nypd officer no less, takes all day? i realize this film was made pre-9/11, but still. i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutes.the acting was mediocre at best all-around, and the characters were seemingly thought up by 7th graders. the child-abuse kid, the pregnant scared girl, the violent gang wannabe, a confused unfortunate victim, the wise-cracking white guy. please.trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? please -- this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop. they're confused, ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb -- far-fetched -- situation. don't try and paint them, suddenly, as noble, the most laughable is ziggy, who lives in the school's attic and admires michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. you've got to be kidding me.the "no racism" signs in the protesting crowd? a black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up. this is a random message.i understand the overall message, which was poorly portrayed, albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careers.this was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof? the worst scene was the kid, fake snow falling, dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof, "promise me" etc. how original.the epilogue of "i went to prison but now i'm pre-law at xyz university" ... a fitting way to end a joke of a movie.

"crimes of passion" is a film that is disappointing on most counts. where should i start from? the plot? it is despairingly simplistic and full of gaps. the direction? reminds a cheap b-movie. the acting? john laughlin is utterly terrible in his role as "well-intentioned-husband-of-a-frozen-wife" bobby, annie pots is unconvincing as "frozen-wife" amy, and it is only kathleen turner (above average), and antony perkins (excellent) which get passable acting marks. more specifically, antony perkins gives a great performance as the pervert reverend peter shayne, while turner manages to portray the roles of sexy china blue and frail joanna crane satisfactorily.unfortunately, the performances of turner and perkins alone are insufficient to help get the film a grade higher than 4/10. watch it if you want to see turner in some sensational scenes (although even on this count the film can be easily matched by its competition-"basic instinct" for example), otherwise avoid.

if you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie (bad in the way only ken russell at his worst can be), you must try this one. it succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn-booth, and you can just about smell the urine on the floor. kathleen turner struts around in a blond wig, getting her kicks from "pretending" to be a two-bit hooker (she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect), and tony perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who is out to maybe murderer her (yet another movie that ends with tony perkins in drag). annie potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit, which is reason enough to hate this movie. the kinky will love the sex scenes, so rent the unrated version in the red box so you can see turner give a cop a taste of his billy club (i had to pause the vcr until we stopped laughing).

ken russell directed this weird ( not very ) erotic thriller and if i hadn't known that i would have staked my life that the director was brian depalma . absolutely everything about crimes of passion screams depalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams " depalma , depalma , depalma "unfortunately since brian depalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans hitchcock over the years russell should have tried emulating a style of his own . sure an erotic thriller in the style of tommy or billion dollar brain would have been bizarre with a capital b but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience . stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market . oh and anthony perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s . yawn the only thing of any real note to crimes of passion is the controversy it caused . i guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity , but as for the controversial sex scenes ... what controversial sex scenes ? there aren't any and the only controversy i can think of is of china blue dominating an on duty policeman with a truncheon . needless to say he didn't come quietly ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

a few yrs ago, i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell. this theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that rozzie r. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).i thought of this essay after watching 'crimes of passion'.kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue. she's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by anthony perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading. and she won't let either of them have a piece of her until ...i won't give away the ending - but i will say that this is ultimately bland whitebread boy's fantasy. no matter how hard ken russell tries, he can't disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation. except its retrogressive class and gender politics make those old black-and-white films look revolutionary by comparison.

the worst part of all is the poor scripting, leading to superficial acting.dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match.holly hunter's character is exaggeratedly self-centered, and hunter herself indulges in serious overacting, as usual.brad johnson was wooden. john goodman made the best of it.furthermore, the whole death / ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone, and now appears rather lame. barely watchable only if you like old aeroplanes.

this film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. why introduce rachel, for instance? she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her "follow me" truck to run wild and crash into dorinda's fence. that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a b-26 or an a-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place. that serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler. as it is, the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control. the ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves much too much talk -- as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. here, dreyfuss just babbles on and on. the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities/impossibilities that i won't describe. what a dull and disjointed effort!

"a lot of the films i've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because i have a lot of old-fashion values." - steven spielbergsome points..1. though this film is a loose remake of "a guy named joe", it also borrows heavily from "a matter of life and death" and "wings of desire".2. this was spielberg's second attempt at being frank capra. 3. spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a "frank capra movie" in the vein of "it's a wonderful life" and "mrs smith goes to washington". judging from his recent attempts to get a "harvey" remake off the ground, it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream, the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 ventures into capracorn.4. critics at the time bashed "always", stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance, but that's really not the problem at all. the problem is that "always" needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point.5. the film is filled with comedy that just doesn't work. spielberg's comedic tastes aren't very sophisticated, and seem to be ripped right out of 1950's screwballs and looney tune cartoons. these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe, but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage.6. the film's lead couple come across as brother and sister, not lovers. spielberg's films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy, but this film goes to extreme lengths: she's a wisecracking tomboy and he's a wisecracking old man. they're more irritating than endearing.7. the film contains one good scene, in which john goodman argues with holly hunter, but for the most part the film's characters are too annoying. there's no subtlety, every emotion overplayed, every joke over designed, every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness.8. "always" and "hook" taught spielberg how to con audiences. after their failure (and the twin financial failures of "the color purple" and "empire of the sun") spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of "color purple" and "empire of the sun" in favour for the more desaturated "black and white" worlds of "schindler's list", "munich", "minority report" and "saving private ryan". from here on, "less light" and "dark cinematography" became equated with "serious topics".9. after the financial success of each "dark film" spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography, and falls flat on his face once again. "amistad" followed "schindler's list", "ai" followed "ryan" and "lincoln" will follow "munich". these "colour" films are always bashed for being too tacky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but the truth is, if you removed the desaturation, all these "serious" films would feel the same way.10. since the 70s, spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors (scorsese, de palma, coppola etc), by pretending to be an "optimist" and "humanist". he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s. the reality, though, is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermining their content, their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. 11. the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in "always", and the relish he shows, instead, for filming forest fires, air-planes crashing etc, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. people running from dinosaurs, sharks, nazis, tripods, rocks etc...this is what spielberg delights in. the moment his characters stop to speak, however, everything self-destructs. a film like "amistad" failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked.12. the film's flying scenes aren't up to the standard's set several years earlier in the mega-hit "top gun". of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's hard to make things cinematic.13. failures like "1941", "hook", "always" etc are often more illuminating that spielberg's more successful films. they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique. they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working, revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery.5/10 ¬ñ there's one good sequence here (two actors in a room, simply improvising), but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script.worth one viewing.

so when bob and marion boxletter see a guy at a hotel, marion believes it is her long lost brother brian, but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face. marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother brian she and bob leave for new york after tracing his whereabouts. they get a hold of brian, but still he doesn't know what they are talking about, but all the couple really want to know is where brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son joey... and even when they see joey he doesn't know them either. the plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well. experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting bob and marion in the same building as each other is beyond me. personally gregory harrison played his 2 parts great, but i have no clue what was wrong with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little suspense yes but that's it.

i had to watch this movie for a film class, i suffered the whole time through. i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film. the film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (rex harrison isn't even asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. the banning of the film in thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of asians. in addition, there has been critical attention given to biography of anna. many critics argue that anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner. some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story. an awful film but good for discussion of biopics as form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction.

i have just caught this movie on tcm, and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this was the best mgm could serve up to him. it is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. it featured two of my favouriteplayers in eve arden (completely wasted) and dean stockwell(the best actor in the film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady frances gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical. john hodiak played his role ok, but the script let him, and the rest of the cast, down very badly. i gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography. it would have been on the first half of the program when double features were the go.

in london, the venetian carla borin (yuliya mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend matteo (jarno berardi). she meets the lesbian real estate agent moira (francesca nunzi) and rents a large apartment. when the jealous matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover bernard (mauro lorenz) in venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral carla has a brief affair with moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. when matteo comes to london, he concludes that his lust for carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior."transgredire" is another "soft porn" of the sick director tinto brass with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast. the amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful yuliya mayarchuk in every possible angle and her character is abused, touched and licked in every part of her nice body, but without showing explicit penetration. this flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a voyeur experience seeing yuliya mayarchuk naked in erotic situations. my vote is four.title (brazil): "a pervertida" ("the pervert")

if a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as i'm concerned. this concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. a good movie has to start and end strong. it all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. there are so many other movies from asia to watch, many of which i am sure most of you have not seen, that i would really skip this one and look elsewhere. why exactly does imdb require a 10 line minimum for reviews? i said my piece and i hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film.

i have not seen and heard the original version.i am no russian, but i am learning right now.i also have no preferences for russia, bulgaia, the us etc.but what i have to mention is:in the german synchronisation in the whole film all russians speak with russian accent. americans talk "hochdeutsch" (without accent)! i have never heard such a stupidity! besides, this is boring.i hope the original is better.the rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. like a cheap version of a james bond film.

freddy forsyth has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the west's suspicions about putin's russia. forsyth installs a nasty guy as the ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to stalin's communism but more to hitlerian fascism. in fact, his political manifesto could have come straight out of mein kampf rather than marx. and, the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the russian federation. american mercenaries connive with the russian prez to realise his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter dirty dancing's pat swayze...and,yep,things get really down and dirty. he's a former us operative-turned-drifter,jason monk, who is enlisted by the british government to see what the russians are up to. as a corny sidebar, swayze's character who is no monk (!)has sired a russian beauty elena (played by the gorgeous marta kondova) on his previous missions to the former commie state. hardman swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil russians. but young unknown actress marta kondova steals the flick as his nubile, 18-year-old russian daughter elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved mother russia.

the movie is complete disaster. i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one, but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. perhaps script writers really don't know sh*t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting.a great and everlasting formula with mad dictator + 1 lonely hero (an american of course) might seem like a good idea, but come on?! we had such a tyrant in serbia (milosevic) who did a lot of bad things to it's people, but i simply can't imagine him yelling "shoot them, shoot them" with such a barbaric passion, like in medieval times. maybe they wanted to show how evil he was, but it was a stupid idea. much better impression would be if he just did it in cold blood, like the real monsters do.the list of nonsense is too long, but the funniest thing is: no matter how many national tv stations there are in russia, russian president watch american snn (cnn) news?? omfg!give me a break!burn this piece of rubish please!awful!

this is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film. the direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and patrick swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body.spy vs spy films are not - or should not - be about car chases and shootings, the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range.even the action shots are just a clich√© with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn.i got half way through and switched off - completely bored.

i just finished reading forsyth's novel 'icon'. i thought it was one of the most in depth, detailed, and page-turning books i ever read, definitely in my top 10. i acquired a dvd version of the book starring mr. swayze. ok, let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2.5 hours film time would of been impossible, so i understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ. however, when i say "differ" what i really should say is "take the characters from the book, add a few, leave a few out, take away the book's plot, add a modern new plot, add frederick forsyth's name in there somewhere". im not saying this was a bad picture, far from it, some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn't half bad. the story sucked and didn't rely on logic or reality. forsyth's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them.. this could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series. if you haven't read the book then expect a decent tv movie with a good acting cast, if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this.

this film was really terrible.however , it's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. i mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! i haven't laughed as hard as i laughed at that for a long time.there were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that i found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end. 2 minutes later they run out again. what the hell was that for?? also , the tiny white forklift that magically changed into a huge yellow digger was pretty classic. i'm led to beleive that this is because they used footage from the 'carnosaur' trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey. i'm gonna have to see those now!the film is worth watching for a laugh or two , but if you dont find bad movies funny, stay away!

i am a huge eric roberts fan, i collect his movies and so far has get to 60. but i¬¥m honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies. but hey that¬¥s why i like him - he is entertaining.but this one has to take the price, i can¬¥t stop wonder why. somehow they managed to get eric and also corbin bernsen to the picture.while bernsen is plain awful (i really don¬¥t like him), roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie (and that doesn¬¥t mean much). he practically do it on routine basis.the female lead (brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and acts like one to. and tim abell and his crew looks like action-man plastic dolls and acts like those to.the plot is really embarrasing. i haven¬¥t seen any of the carnosaur movies so i can¬¥t recall on the footage that has been added from there, but it explains some things. but still there are holes huge as craters in the plot.spoilers alertthe first attacks are located outside the laboratory in the woods nearby. but at the end they blow the whole laboratory in pieces and just relax that everything is over, but they forgot about the ones outside??????when the helicopter pilot is eaten alive i wonder how she couldn¬¥t notice a t-rex climbing into the chopper????the guys in orange overalls is my favourite - what are they doing, out for a jogging round or what??of course there are a b-movie standard sex-scene with silicon titties involved too. this time it¬¥s lorissa mccomas that greets us. i don¬¥t have any problem with that (she looks awful) but to look at a guy squeezing tits and being on the verge of climax for 8!!!! minutes is just tooo long.shame on you all (including eric roberts) - now i look forward to watch con games (i wonder???)

the only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is not because i haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far. it's because this film was only made partly in 2001. the rest of it was stolen from roger corman's other dinosaur films, carnosaur 1-3.i have a confession to make. "carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite b-movies. it borrows so much from james cameron's "aliens" it's not even funny. but i love it. i can't explain exactly why. it just works for me. i liked the sets, i liked the cinematography, i liked how they borrowed from "aliens". it's all a bit ironic that cameron at one point was an understudy of corman's, with films like "battle beyond the stars" (1980).i own the carnosaur trilogy on dvd, and the most i can say for part one is that it has moments. the most i can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable.now we have "raptor," which does not continue that series. instead, it borrows entire scenes from the carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around it. and somehow roger corman was able to get eric roberts and corbin bernsen to do it. now, i'm not saying either roberts or bernsen are at any kind of career high. but they were both at one point what could be called respectable actors. not here. sure, actors react to effects they won't even see while filming all the time. here, however, they are reacting to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old. there's even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in "carnosaur 1." apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back.when "raptor" was announced i was a wee bit excited. i was however disappointed when corman said that they'd be using the old dinosaur models from "carnosaur." apparently corman decided after this interview was conducted that he wouldn't even do that. and its not that he couldn't find an fx crew to do it. the script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre-existing stock footage.don't compare this to ed wood. ed did better than this. at least he only used the stock footage of bela once, in one film. there are ways of incorporating stock footage into a movie, and "raptor" takes this frowned-upon technique to a new low. even if you liked "carnosaur 3: primal species," stay away from "raptor."

the shanghai cobra starts out like gangbusters, with a rain soaked diner scene straight out of shack out on 101 or gun crazy (the first one). unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful mantan moreland. it's as if director karlson blew half his budget in the first five minutes, just getting the set up the way he wanted it. watch the beginning and think about the phenix city story.

admittedly, i am not a fan of the monogram chan films. . the plot, involving radium theft from a bank vault, is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that fox produced. mantan moreland and benson fong (as no. 3 son tommy) provide some laughs as usual. but otherwise there isn't much here. great title that is wasted.

it was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! and there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. but the biggest problem i had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. the director and writers of "the comebacks" somehow forget to get creative. while i must admit that i laughed at certain scenes,"the comebacks" could have been so much funnier. the actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie. a spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark. some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem. take "naked gun" for instance. their is always something happening on screen. in "the comebacks" they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background. only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching! it still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off. and jermaine williams as ipod. his parody on cuba gooding jr. as radio was hilarious! he seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about. not entirely bad!

a comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, the comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, lambeau fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. in the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no "i" in "team"!i decided to watch the unrated version for this film. it was thirty minutes longer and i though it may be better than the theatrical release, hearing that people hated this movie. after all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie. well, i certainly was wrong. it was as bad as the recent "meet the spartans" but it was thirty minutes more of torture!seriously, who makes a close to two hour spoof movie?! a spoof movie is short because if it goes any longer, it would be overkill! honestly, i love stupid comedies. heck, i liked "date movie," "white chicks," "epic movie," and "little man"! i guess when it comes to spoof movies, it is either a hit or miss and this one definitely missed.on the lighter side, from the many jokes in this film, i will say about six or seven made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. but that's not saying much. following those jokes were more scenes of torture and unfunniness.i can't see how people would say this is not a terrible spoof film. in fact, there is as much product placement in here like meet the spartans, there are as many dance sequences, and unfunny jokes. i will say another thing i like about this movie is the songs. they are some very good songs in here. overall, watch it if you like spoof films. skip it if you like funny films.

do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of any sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour? is there even just a single genuinely funny parody film anymore? all i see are zero-quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera. these movies are not funny, they're not clever, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every conceivable way.the comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself "sports movie". it's the same thing, though. there are a few different writers for these films, the wayans did some, freidberg and seltzer did some others, and i'm sure there's another pair. i can't even tell the difference in direction or humour to be honest, it all seems like the same people wrote and directed them. i can't tell if the comebacks was done by the people who did scary movie or the guys who did epic movie, or someone else, it's just the same jokes from all the others.if you have any shred of taste or value for humour, don't see this movie. if you have self-worth, don't bother seeing it. if you have any respect for film making, don't even consider watching it. don't see it in any broke down, derelict theatre that may still carry it, don't rent it, don't order it on netflix or pay-per-view, don't redbox it, and don't even watch it for free on od. avoid it like the plague.the only conceivable reasons i can see to watch this film are as follows.a. masochism. if you like torturing yourself, there's very few better ways. b. seeing a prime example of why to avoid anything that says "fox atomic". c. you're being paid considerably high amounts of cash.i really would not watch the entire thing if someone offered me $100 to do it. it's just mindless, mental collapsing torment.you might as well watch zohan.

for the record, i hate spoof movies. except for mel brooks and airplane! because those are classics and make fun of the clich√©s, not the actual movies itself. i think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. i especially hate things created by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer, the "geniuses" behind date movie, epic movie, and meet the spartans.i decided to give the comebacks a look. since friedberg and seltzer had nothing to do with the production, i was as objective as possible. it was just like one of their movies. it was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame kindergarten jokes, and disturbing images of bodily injury that's supposed to make me laugh and failed.only someone high would laugh at these jokes. toilet bowl? who wrote this? an 11 year old? i was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of wedding crashers, which was actually pretty decent. but there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning orphanage. the only reason that i gave this two stars (when it clearly deserved one) was because friedberg & seltzer had nothing to do with this.

when i first saw the trailer for the comebacks, it looked absolutely horrible and i had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on dvd today, i figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest, i would rent it and give it a shot. i watched it tonite and it really wasn't that bad. i think it was immature and stupid at times, but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh. i don't really watch many sports movies, so i wonder maybe if i saw more, maybe this movie would make more sense to me, but it's all good, i still didn't mind so much watching the comebacks. i admit, these "stupid spoof" movies are lame, but what's the harm in a stupid joke every once in a while? the comebacks isn't really that bad if you give it a fair chance.coach fields is failing in life, family and career both, but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser football team into the championship. but the team is really really terrible, like beyond terrible. but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all, even though that might turn into something more sad.the comebacks over all isn't the worst film i've seen, i think it's good for a couple laughs and giggles. i know that this was stupid, but i couldn't help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he's beating the nerd's head against the locker, just him and the nerd in general were so funny together. if you have an open mind and don't take this movie too seriously, i think you'll have a fun time watching it, if you watch it expecting it to be oscar worthy material, this is not the movie for you.4/10

one would think that since this film has a bad rep that i would be exaggerating when i say i hated this film.but i'm am serious this movie was just so stupid and so unfunny, and such a waste of time.i mean after the first 30, i had a major headache and the smile i had on my face(that was mostly getting ready to laugh) was wearing off.when this film was over i was so glad and because i had good expectations that it would be funny i was extremely disappointed.the acting is not great, the comedy moments are lame and unfunny.hardly anything is good about this, because i laughed at like maybe 2 parts.overall this is so boring and i can't tell you how awful this is, i think this could be used as a suicide technique.i mean i don't think for some its even watchable.so my final words on this are, avoid at all costs.

1st movie comment ever! i'll start with saying "come on! wasn't that bad... was it?"... no it was't that bad actually. i laughed and giggled enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbish.it's completely different, this and epic movie (epic movie sucked bad.. doh!). "how so?" people would ask. i'll tell you how. this movie is not as nearly as pointless, not to mention that the stupid (and i say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie. not the best around but hey... what would you expect - look at the poster! some people said it was stupid, i find that when writing a comment one should be more objective (my own opinion) but yeah, of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! look, i'm not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century. what i am telling is that, if you happen to see the movie somewhere, please don't carve your eyes on the opening credits. see what it's all about - who knows, you might like it a bit.i give it 4/10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.

this movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from india who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. the fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.the plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. it's a classic and trite sports theme. but alas, the screenplay was too weak for any cast to pull it off. and this cast is no exception.there is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear, so it's not all bad from that aspect.but animal house or talladega nights, this is not.

the first 1/3 of this movie i loved and thought it was going to be one of truffaut's best films. i loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen. especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real pen pal so she could take her place! she then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! i was really hooked and wanted to see more,...and then, the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb! despite her coming from new caladonia (an island in the pacific) and he from reunion (an island in the indian ocean), when he goes on a trip to the south of france, he stumbles upon her almost immediately. hmm,....odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. then, instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. okay--this is tough to believe, but okay,...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! no one is that stupid! yes, the character catherine deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly. plus, if he only wanted her as a sex object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evil.this movie, due to it's very ridiculous plot, does not deserve such high ratings! unless you are a die-hard truffaut fan, try another film--even one of truffaut's--just not this one.

i'm trying to find something of value here. the best i can muster is that truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious, painful, puerile, annoying, illogical, and brainless as the experience of being in love. if that was his goal, then he succeeded, but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watch.there is one scene that screams for a spoof: belmondo compares the features of deneuve's face to the features in a landscape . all i could think the whole time was "glacier," "ice floe," "two lonely fishermen wearing army surplus on a frozen lake in minnesota."the only other point of interest was the resurrection of buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. the tropics are presented as paradise, and things get progressively worse as they get colder, hell being calvinist french switzerland. that was kind of funny.

...if you've been laughing too much for a long time, and need to take a break.after reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself. everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true. mind of mencia is like a half hour version of mad tv, but with somehow worse jokes.one skit i had the displeasure of watching was "the second annual stereotype olympics". what's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming, or gay guy named "sparkles" that wins a banana eating contest? neither of these concepts is particularly novel, insightful, or amusing. do we really need a joke about star wars every episode? that movie came out like 30 years ago. mencia's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about hispanics and throw a few "beaners" in there; and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money. pure comedic genius.then he blatantly ripped off jeff foxworthy on a second show i watched, with a "your gay if..." bit. you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a ryan-seacrest-is-gay joke. it's not like either of those has already been done to death.unless you're a big fan of jason friedberg and adam seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. especially when there are authentic comedians like dave chappelle out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful.

i'm surprised that the comparison hasn't been made yet between mind of mencia and the television program the awful truth, which ran a few years ago. helmed by controversial director michael moore, the show would begin, in the exact same manor as this show, with moore interacting with the audience, and introducing segments, namely short documentaries and skits, which had been put together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current issues. the difference? mencia rarely delves past the superficial and the reactionary. what he says and does is often pandering and rude, and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves. there's a difference between being "edgy", which i have no problem with, but mencia tries too hard to accomplish this, and ends up coming off as arrogant, and with little backing. he does however, make points occasionally, but often in order to get to them, one has to sit through some pretty mind numbing attempted shock humor.

this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave chapelle left. here's the problem with carlos mencia. firstly, his birth name is ned holness, and was known that until he was 18, when he switched his name to ned arnel mencia. he was born in honduras, though he acts like he's from mexico. he grew up in the united states, as well.i might be able to forgive all that crap, but...he's been caught stealing other peoples material. joe rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. the stereotype olympics was an idea he ripped off a couple of dj's from miami. he has stolen jokes from bill cosby. he stole george lopez's material in his own hbo special (13 minutes of it).he thinks what he's doing is so original, but dave chapelle and lisa lampanelli have been cracking on race for years before this idiot (amoung others).this show will crash and burn. the word beaner can't last that long before it gets old. he hasn't done anything new since the first episode."wanna hear a joke? a beaner jumping a fence!! that's funny for 3 seasons!" not.awful.

carlos mencia just plain isn't funny! his show is painful to watch because of that. his sketches/parodies are all very horrible, and this really just feels like a filler for the chapelle show, which while i'm not a big fan of that, it is much funnier than this trash. carlos mencia gives the stupid speeches and he all too often depends on finishing his monologues with a retarded voice and going "der, der der." it's just not funny. he often, when talking to others, makes puns. they are horrible and painful. when people don't laugh, he blames them...why would anyone laugh, he's not funny. he has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show, it's amazing that anyone but 3 year olds watch this. one of my least favorite things he does, is water down every topic and make it seem like a joke! i hope that this racist idiot gets taken off the air as soon as possible because he's dumbing down a station that doesn't need to be dumbed down anymore.

what is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it? carlos mencia is no george lopez. there is a difference. when watching comedian carlos mencia, i think he hates his own people. and more than that, i think he was forced to pattern his show as the "hispanic/latino/spanish" version of the dave chappelle show. what a horrible mistake. (note to mencia: please do not do a "block party" movie. as much as i would like to see santana, tierra, el chicano, christina agullaria, jennifer lopez, shakira and the reunion of the cast of "xica da silva" on one stage, don't.) carlos mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as dave chappelle liked using the "n" word. neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it's from 'their own people'. carols mencia also likes to say, "if you're offended, too bad". it's not the offense, it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.carols mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. it's not comedy, it's not funny. there is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning.mind of mencia needs polishing because carlos mencia needs polishing. find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. until then, the show, mind of mencia is a pass.

i absolutely love stand-up comedy. i love to hear the raw thoughts of the stand-up on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ****ing stupid that they had to share it with someone. there used to be stand-ups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to (rodney dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others (richard pryor). and then, there were the thought-provoking comics like george carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things.now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "mind of mencia," which, as i agree with most commentators here, is comedy central's horrid solution to the loss of "chappelle's show," but it does. carlos mencia spends half of the show doing stand-up bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. he tries to be all three of the above types of stand-ups. he makes a stage character, an every-day mexican named carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your run-of-the-mill normal guy. he then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. and then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view.carlos mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around:laugh.promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in stand-up. the best comedians, which, i fear, carlos mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. they talk universally, and ask you to laugh at absurdity, rather than with it, like mencia encourages. as he creates more skits or "real-life" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it. his show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want (something that, as much as i hate to compare the two, was "chappelle's show's" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it---which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "dee dee dee!" this show is appropriately named. it is indeed a show about "the mind of mencia." it's mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. the show is tailor-made to give life lessons to its core audience, 14-24 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to carlos mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!

yup, that's right folks, this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television. if you want to watch a sad, lonely and unfunny hack comedian attempt to entertain the masses with a half hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your mildly retarded cousin commented on at the thanksgiving dinner table then this might be the show for you. this is billed as edgy comedy my friends but to be honest this makes tim allen look like richard pryor. avoid at all costs. unless you're a masochist.

...so where's my friggin trophy? i seriously expected a banner and confetti to drop from my ceiling for watching a full 30 minutes of that crap. comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately, trying to fill the void left by chappelle with multiple seasons of a retarded man impersonating retarded men. dah duh nah!! if you pay attention to the show, you'll notice that when mencia isn't stuttering over punchlines and laughing at his own skits, he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor. you ever notice how people in buick's drive really slow? it's like dah duh nah! not even the midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from mencia's distinct lack of talent. furthermore, mencia isn't even a "wetback" as he constantly and adamantly proclaims he is, which makes him a fraud on top of it all.if anything good could be said about mencia, it's his effort. the man clearly has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, god knows he's trying.

i haven't watched this show in months, but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it. so maybe it's undergone some vast improvement in all that time, although the commercials and the 4.2 rating on imdb aren't a good sign.it was clearly just a quick replacement for chappelle's show. even mencia says so. and while i wasn't even that big a fan of chappelle's show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far edgier than mencia has ever been). mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and stale. if you can't see that, i guess there's just no hope for you. but to be fair, here are some examples: --mencia blatantly rips off chapelle's lil jon skit. just takes it.--"south park" makes an episode about scientology. one week later, mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists. bear in mind the joke isn't about scientologists, but about how much he's offended them on his show. when up to this point, he has never made a single scientology joke, ever.--after hurricane katrina, two ap photos go around the internet showing a black man "looting" groceries and a white woman "finding" them. weeks later, after millions of people have already seen this, mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time (the daily show would have been on something like that in a day). pathetic.even more annoying than the joke-stealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show, claiming he's breaking down some sort of pc barrier (whatever) and that if you aren't laughing, you must be a weak prude who can't handle any jokes about race. yes, carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was really true, then why was chappelle's show so popular?). he constantly berates his audience for "not getting it" if he doesn't get enough laughs, and often repeats and explains his jokes, a technique most comedians stop using by age 14.the worst part is that mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. it's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier, more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money. his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central, which is baffling (again, it has a 4.2 rating on this site). where the hell are they getting these numbers?? comedy central tries to bill itself as an "edgy" station, but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible, that will never be the case.

i thought "puppets making crank phone calls" was pretty low, but i don't believe that carlos mencia's show even qualifies as comedy. his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" as many times as he possible can. i have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on imdb before, but i really do hope this show is never renewed or rerun.mencia is trying to be the next dave chapelle, and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. it is obvious right down to the rip of chapelle's intro (blues guys vs. mariachi band). however, mencia has absolutely *no* attitude, and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time. instead he sticks to a small number of hardly-shocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes "jokes" about immigration. every once in a while, he'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like middle eastern cultures. these jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture, and perhaps some incredibly old topics (such as 9/11), in a watered down, stand-up style, while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience's style. i think he's too afraid of really offending anyone, so it just makes the viewer feel awkward. he also beats jokes to death. if you've ever seen "why the f*** is this news?" you'll know what i'm talking about. it's funny at first, but he just rambles on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point. it's a trainwreck that is purely painful to watch.

this is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show i've ever seen. i'm confounded that this guy was given his own show. it smells of complete and utter desperation on the part of comedy central, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable dave chapelle. he's a tip from ned's bag of comedy gold: is a punchline not funny? need to give it that extra push into hilarity? f***ing yell it at the top of your lungs. simple, no? and as an added bonus....finish half your jokes with...then you're re-tah-ded!! or duh-du-duuuuhhhh! oh man. so....funny. beaner...hilarious. wetback....does the laughter ever stop?to illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, i'll cite an example. mencia jokes about how "retarded" it is to rebuild new orleans, because it's so close to the water. genius. the line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly. while a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy, finding subtle ways of weaving a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take solace in, ned goes for the obvious. move the city. great. wait, is that funny? ned doesn't have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. the hurricane didn't flood the city, ned. the levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars...and behold! they broke. i guess that's god's way of telling us we shouldn't be there. after all, he's got a seat in congress. what a fool.chapelle was a master of turning a tired racial comedic spin on its head. he was effortless at it, and at all points, we were laughing with him. while mencia talks about black people not being able to swim *yawn,* chapelle took it 300 yards further with the black and blind white supremesist. you don't have to be scathing to be edgy. you have to be original. mencia and his legions of fans are like that closeted gay dude who laughs all too emphatically at gay jokes, thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities. except of course, with ned, he's laughing all too emphatically at the "retards." du-du-duuuuh.

this is one of the most ridiculous westerns that hollywood ever made. gary cooper plays 'reb hollister', a former confederate officer wanted by the law. he meets up with a moron named weatherby, played by leif erickson, who is a u.s. marshal with no knowledge of firearms. weatherby is on his way to dallas to see his fiancee, tonia robles, played by ruth roman. senor robles, tonia's father, has plenty of men, but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly rustled by the marlow brothers. will marlow, played by raymond massey, has financed the loan on the robles estate, making things completely absurd. he even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they're due, simply because he feels like it.since weatherby is a boston boy who can't fight, since he only became a marshal so he could visit his fiancee, tonia, (just another instance of more plot nonsense. are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? wait a minute, this guy couldn't pass the written test either.) he switches identities with reb hollister, who of course is an expert gunman. reb takes the liberty of greeting weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss, while weatherby looks on like an idiot. gary cooper, hollywood's number one stud, is in fine form here as reb. before the movie's done, not only does he take weatherby's job, he steals his fiancee also, and ruth roman as tonia, falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump leif erickson the brush-off before the films little more than half over.there isn't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the film is a dud. and cooper's character is a complete heel to boot. the film also stars barbara payton as brant marlow's girl, a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances, unfortunately, by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. i strongly suggest you pass this one up.

stylized hollywood westerns, full of familiar conventions, seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar. everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from 1939, a larger budget applied, and this production its issue.gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times -- the displaced southerner, fast on the draw and firm with honor, though kinda easy going whenever possible. he plays blayde hollister who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation. he wears a buckskin-fringed shirt and packs two ivory-handled six shooters. he speaks with a countrified accent -- "a feller could get hurt doin' this." (cf., "sergeant york.") the gang is led by sneering raymond massey, who buys and sells land, usually by underhanded means whenever possible. the gang includes steve cochran, who cannot play a westerner though he's very good at scum bags in general. the requisite woman is ruth roman, daughter of the mexican plantation owner, who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty.i don't think i'll bother too much with the plot. no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it's not worth much more mention. as in any 1939 western, it's labyrinthine. everyone except cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets.everything is retro. the plot, the dialog, the wardrobe, even the music. the score is by warner's stalwart max steiner. he's the guy that scored "king kong." that was 1932. this movie was released in 1950.cooper's name, by the way -- "blayde hollister" -- prompted me to look through the records of the raca -- the real american cowboy associaton -- to see if that name cropped up in their archives, which date from the beginning of time to february 4th, 1911, when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary. there has never been a real cowboy with the name blayde. hollister, yes, but not blayde. as a matter of fact, there is no record of any real cowboy named wade, luke, cole, or matt either. the most popular names for genuine cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were clarence, mortimer, noble, nebukadnezzar, plautus, pinchbeck, and hortense.if this movie had been released in 1939, it would have been routine. in 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.

kinda funny how comments for this film went consistently downhill, now add mine. i think the script could have been saved by better acting, and the acting by a better script. together, it was difficult to watch, and i don't flinch from such subject matter.sigourney was the best part (i thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offered to its genre) but even she lagged. can't blame her, who knows what takes were left on the cutting room floor by the director and/or editor. the whole movie had an "okay, that's good enough, let's move on" feel to it, when i know there was more to be mined from the actors and the script, which did have some good lines and some interesting themes.i don't think this counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where sigourney marches up to her son's supposed tormentor's house and has this look on her face and i thought "that's the face of someone who is overacting what it's like to see someone living in a mobile home" and sure enough, next shot, meant to shock us i'm sure, bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a nice house, like hers.as many other posters have pointed out, there are so many better movies with similarly airy scripts about similarly messed up families that hit the notes better -- "celebration" probably being the ultimate example that i've seen.

i just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that, in light of recent dramas such as these, the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. i would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counter-productive this conclusion is, even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree. but, instead, i realized that these films have made the very determination of the great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life (much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle), supplanting it instead with the "reality" of how things actually are. that in fact, what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional, but in fact, a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along, but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus, have ignored or at least denied.only problem is, that too many films have been trying to make this point. and by doing so in nearly identical form. when i had read the synopsis for the film, i immediately thought of 'ice storm.' while watching the depressing lifelessness of the travis family, which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating, i immediately recalled 'american beauty.' and, in some regards, the interactions between the parents and the middle child, tim, i drew similarities from 'igby goes down.' 'imaginary heroes' may be a novel experience, maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that, as said before, is often not permitted to exist in the films of family (which is idiotic to think anyways, considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like 'ordinary people' as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that). but, to the well-versed viewer, these films may offer nothing new. they have in fact, become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to out-do the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family (and here, it extends to neighbors and friends). in fact, 'imaginary heroes,' the latest in this genre (i do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a 'genre'), crams so many disasters and surprises into one family, that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host. it is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion. the youngest son knew this, the father was in a daze and blinded by the push for competitiveness in his all-star son. and it's not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man.granted, it is no less entertaining (to some extent, for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while), and the performances are quite good, especially by sigourney weaver and jeff daniels. but, i sure hope that filmmakers in the future wishing to add to the commentary of struggling familial relationships (which coincidentally or not always seem to be upper-middle class white suburban families) intend to offer something new by way of material and insight. i should see no distinction (and consequently, no purpose) otherwise.

this wretched psychodrama uses every shabby device in the book to wheedle attention and sympathy from us for its characters, who, with one exception, are not worthy of any notice at all, let alone two precious hours of filmgoers' time.as in robert redford's "ordinary people" (a superb film that, in comparison, clearly shows up the vacuity of "heroes"), a late teenage boy has died, leaving his family in the throes of bereavement. in this case, the death was a suicide, an event that nearly always poisons the emotional well of the survivors in a particularly corrosive way. we follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months.the father (jeff daniels) becomes a withdrawn, virtually mute, usually drunken stiff who secretly takes leave from his job for months, sits instead on a park bench all day, and insists on setting a full plate of food at the deceased son's place for every meal. he treats everyone else in the family with unerring nastiness. he sees his doctor regularly but the issue of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never comes up.the mother (sigourney weaver) yells at the neighbor woman, among others, gets busted when she stupidly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) at a head shop (what adult in reality would ever try such a dumb stunt?), and, near the end, swoons into coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer (she's a heavy smoker). ms. weaver has a few flip lines but generally behaves too unintelligently to merit much empathy. it's not that there aren't people out there who behave in these silly ways when severely stressful circumstances arise. but why make a film of such drivel? what can anyone learn from this pair's conduct? the deceased's older sister (michelle williams) is away at college and all too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. the younger brother (played by emile hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. his suffering is genuine, its causes multifold, and his conduct is coherent within the circumstances. but hirsch's character is too soft spoken, too morose and beaten down, to carry the movie. the other bit players, subtexts and cutesy, unreal dialogue don't help.the suicide theme is echoed in an almost nonchalant manner in the case of two other minor characters. so what is the writer-director, dan harris, trying to say about this subject? that it isn't a serious matter? why jeff daniels agreed to play the sap of a father as written in this screenplay is something only his therapist might possibly be able to answer. avoid this dog. instead rent redford's classic. my rating: 4/10 (c-). (seen on 2/17/05). if you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.

this was a character's movie. the plot wasn't that hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well-acted. the story focuses on the travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide. i say that loosely, because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too, they edited the movie pretty poorly. the acting on all parts was very good, particularly emile hirsch as the surviving, confused son. the characters were all very interesting and i didn't mind watching them until late in the film, when it just seemed to drag. my big complaint, however, was the story. the son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot. however, it really wasn't. it was something that happened at the start of the story, but then everything went every which way. then they'd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread. the other thing was that the big plot twists, of which there were plenty, were never really explained or built up to, but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field. in fairness, the ending was very, very cool. but it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (the half that wasn't padding) was pretty much lifted from the story in the pearl jam song alive. which reminds me... there was a "poem" in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed themself. i could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted, word for word, from that very same song. i dunno, this was a movie i had hope for, and they really, really dropped the ball.

===========big spoiler================================== this is a terrible movie with no likable characters. so many clich√©s and senseless scenes. it needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left. please save your two hours. the only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself. the description read "moments of dark comedy". perhaps i missed those when i blinked. the horrible characters start right with the funeral. the funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide? then the father makes digs at the only son left? right at the funeral? how is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with sigourney weaver's character is the bad guy for telling the husband? the father doesn't even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist. the movie tries to shove every dramatic clich√© possible into one movie: father over-driving athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide, the son left feeling lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, child conceived via affair but raised as husband's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bullies, possible terminal illness, etc, etc, etc. do not waste your 2 hours.

viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same. story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt (kip pardue) who was a very promising high school swimmer. ben (jeff daniels) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son tim (emile hirsch) as well as matt but he does communicate (of some sort) to his mother sandy (sigourney weaver) who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it.*****spoiler alert***** sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail. she doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on tim's body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work. after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family.this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on "x2" and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story (for me) just has too many things thrown in. the script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimentation with homosexuality, and a life threatening illness. if all those scenarios weren't enough for you harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards tim. while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another i must admit that i didn't hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that. everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than hirsch. weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. harris shows he can be a good writer/director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived.

the somewhat-belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way (by acting out) but that dad is morose and blaming himself. writer-director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then lays all the story-points out in the most obvious terms: suicide! secrets! gay shame! family sickness! ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow, harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary, sentimental fashion. sigourney weaver's bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she's a joy--that is, until harris gives her a make-over (complete with sensible new hairstyle). it's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** from ****

combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times. looking for comedy in the muslim world pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script; not to mention albert brooks' excellent broodish character portrayal. but man of the year can't come close by comparison. it has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable.the premise initially seemed very promising. put a jon stewart-like comedy news guy up for president of the united states and see what happens. this independent runner is tom dobbs (robin williams, rv), a successful tv personality who is pressured into running by his audience. along with him comes his manager jack (christopher walken, click), and his writer eddie (lewis black). seeming to have very little chance at a successful run, tom dobbs amazingly wins the election.but did he? eleanor green (laura linney, the exorcist of emily rose) is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations. she finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney alan (jeff goldblum, independence day). poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out, the company's evil men decided to discredit and/or kill eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. but eleanor is able to get to president-elect dobbs and finally spill the beans (this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming, too). dobbs goes onto saturday night live and explains everything to the world, thus removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company ...oh, and saving ms. green's life.does any of this sound funny? the comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward. robin williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became president bears down on him.the message of the film is interesting and debatable, too: that special interest owns presidential candidates. i'm sure there's substantial truth in this, and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could. if you wanted to make a comedy about you could. but man of the year isn't it.

i was aware of man of the year's critical pans and unremarkable gross, but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because i know good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall months.what i found out was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired. surprising is an understatement considering barry levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in good morning vietnam and wag the dog) and robin williams' obvious comic gifts. robin williams, in fact, is mysteriously underused. on the "making of" featurette that comes with the dvd, barry levinson talked about how sometimes he let robin williams improvise off the script, like it was some naughty secret of his. um¬Öare you really that much of a moron, barry levinson? whenever you have robin williams in your film and want to use him for his comic abilities (basically, every movie he's been in other than insomnia or one hour photo), don't cage him within a script. let him ad-lib whatever he wants because he is the funnier than anything anyone else can write for him and his uncontained comic rants can instantly raise the bar on any mediocre movie like rv or patch adams. what i found even more baffling in his failure to make use of robin williams was that back in 1987, levinson used this exact formula to perfection in good morning vietnam, injecting robin williams' bursts of comic zaniness into a war picture to make a resounding political piece.so the film isn't as much of a laugh-fest as it could be and feels awkwardly lost in its tone. if the film had potential to work as anything, it might have made one of those thrillers from the mid-'90s in the style of the pelican brief, the fugitive, or one of those jack ryan films. its plot centered around an employee at a silicon valley company uncovering a glitch in a system that reveals that the country elected the wrong president and the efforts of the ceos to eliminate her before the secret gets out, so if you replaced robin williams with some harrison-ford-type actor, or perhaps even harrison ford himself, added a couple more explosions, and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go. i'll never really know and it's not worth it to try to find out.

lets be realistic here. this is one of the worst shows i have ever seen. my wife and kids showed real promise in its first season and only went down hill after that. it is so bad that words do not describe. the acting and writing are so dreadful on a consistent basis i wonder if damon wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose. from top to bottom every performance is ridiculous. damon wayans completely phones it in and george gore ii is so horrible i cringe at every over-acted line. can anyone really watch this show and find it to be entertaining let alone funny? please i implore you. do not watch this show. as soon as tv affiliates stop picking this up in syndication we can finally be rid of this absolute garbage.

i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re-runs. i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season. once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate. the first problem was that they did that irrelevant, scenario of history repeating itself (jr having a kid like his parents did). the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone (ex: katie and franklin) . the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t.v. and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious . the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that clarie claimed as a boyfriend. the fifth one had to be katie, she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her "boyfriend" franklin like the pushover he was. the last but not least was noah gray-cabey!! franklin, franklin was just scary. it was like watching a terrible combination of urkle and tj henderson only more annoying!!! they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show. there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can't act. eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly. however, b.f.(before frank) this show was funny and very entertaining.

my wife and kids was billed as the 00s very own cosby show- but unlike the latter, it was unfunny and unwatchable. in fact, it is so poorly written and some of the jokes revolve around michael mickey taking michael jr's dumbness and the fact that he is such a loser- which got more and more tedious and annoying as the show went on.what was supposed to have been a promising hit, eventually turned into a dumb, silly show later on where the ideas became so ott and ridiculous. and as for the second claire, i ended up disliking this character so much: she became a spoilt, childish and moaning teenage brat, in most of the later episodes.mwak was no cosby show trend setter, rather it was just a poor black sitcom by general standards.

this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and... i stopped caring. this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex. there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment. also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...sounds promising?not really.i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film. basically i started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up.it may work for you, it didn't for me.

i loathe, despise, and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison. it's nothing but a campy, frightening, and completly shoddy trip down memory lane to that oh-so-nasty time, the 70's, a decade im glad i wasnt a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offer!the animation is sickeningly dated, not least of all with it's tacky, missing frames, and characters with huge, bulbous heads, this film is an eye-sore. from the knowing, snide nod to the parents with the freakily gay sea horse, and it's camp hand motions and kenneth williams-esque voice, to the overtly, unsubtly druggy anthem, high cockalorum, this film, im sad to say, is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully recovered from the terror it caused me....this ghastly display of complete terribleness should carry an r rated certificate, so disturbing it is in it's contents!

this is a dreadful adaption of charles kingsley's story. the animation is, to put it bluntly, awful. and the songs are a disgrace to film songs, epsecially the "high cockororim" song, which they keep repeating. i feel sorry for jon pertwee and david jason, 2 of britain's finest talents, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. bernerd cirbbins tries his best to perform in this awful production ,but fails.avoid this film at all costs, even if it is the last film on this planet!

classic author c.s. lewis once wrote an essay stating that no children's story is worth the reading, viewing etcetera if it can only be enjoyed by children. i'd say this film is an easy one to hold up as a defence of his argument.around the age of five or six, i loved it, tracked it down only three or four years later and found it to be wet, poorly animated, dully and confusingly written, and with distressingly repetitive and awful songs (i'm looking t you, hi-cockalorum), showing a production aiming at joyful silliness and whimsy, but resulting with an ugly, twee, frustrating mess.by all means, show this to your infant, but i would heartily recommend that you don't buy a copy or attempt to sit in on the viewing. if you want something set in the same era but with genuine charm and wit, go after 'oliver twist' or the bbc's brilliant adaptation of 'the box of delights'.

i was 12 when this film was released and adored it. the song's were inspiring and it made me feel good, watching it several time's at the cinema. i actually had the soundtrack album and played the song's over and over.26 years later...i'm ashamed. just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it lot's but my cynical older grown up eyes hated it. it's very poorly directed in many places and considering it was lionel jeffries directing i really wanted to enjoy it. the character animation was so rough yet the backgrounds were quite good. i remember the critics at the time saying that it was a poor film and was horrified but now i agree.it is an old film yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that's why i thought it was good then. but that does not excuse it for it's poor acting, directing and sloppiness. the main child actor's voice seem's dubbed which is very distracting too. can't quite see what they were trying achieve when it was being made, all that it become was a weak film.

very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins (1964) and bedknobs and broomsticks (1971). the human cast is very distinguished - james mason, billie whitelaw, david tomlinson, joan greenwood, bernard cribbins - but their roles range from the miscast (a 69 year-old mason as a thieving chimney-sweep!) to the inconsequential (greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat) to the bizarre (whitelaw plays several 'exotic' characters - including a circus performer, an old hag, a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason).the animated segment of the film, handled by a group of east-european animators, is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and, as usual, with this type of thing, there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with, one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good. the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed (far more successfully) other children's films namely the railway children (1970) and the amazing mr. blunden (1972; which i've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk).

a real hoot, unintentionally. sidney portier's character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him. nothing about this movie rings true. and it's boring to boot.

maybe this wowed them in the 50's, but this is one of those flicks that doesn't age well. it's got that preachy, earnest, downtrodden working man vibe of a 2nd rate rod serling live tv "playhouse" broadcast. the "plot" is by the book, the cassevetes character's troubled background seems tacked-on, and the love interest is unconvincing and half-hearted.sidney portier gives an ok performance, but man he sure was an annoying, haughty snot. if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse i'd probably want to hit him with a grappling hook too. jack warden is good, because as usual, he plays jack warden.like 90% of the films rated on imdb (whether they are classics, mediocre or crapola) somehow this one gets rated with 7-point-some-stars. it is in no way deserving of that. save your time

pat o'brien portrays knute rockne, the all-american notre dame football coach. no doubt, this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of "knute rockne all-american notre dame football" - probably, it's most interesting to serious followers of football and/or notre dame football. you will see some good documentary-style film footage.otherwise, it's difficult to recommend this as a film. it's not much more than an historical document. you'll "know" the end is near when gale page gets a chill - and, don't blink or you'll miss ronald reagan doing, of all things, "camille"! *** knute rockne - all-american (1940) lloyd bacon ~ pat o'brien, gale page, ronald reagan

forced, cloying, formulaic. do these adjectives make you want to run to rent his? miriam hopkins was brilliant in the original "dr. jekyl and mr. hyde." a few other early movies of hers, notably "the story of temple drake," are never shown but said to be excellent.here, she is cutesy, bossy, and thoroughly unappealing. ray milland as a greeniwch village bohemian not at all convincing.the two child performers are creepy and also bear no relation to the village as it was then.speaking as a native of greenwich village, i find the setting ersatz, generic, and phony. not that i was around for a couple generations but my relatives were there in 1937. it isn't funny. it isn't remotely authentic. we don't care about the characters.so many movies were made about the struggling masses vs the capitalists at this time, and done with elan. "easy living" comes to mind. it didn't take place in the village. but it rings very true. this rings with a thudding knell.

the most irritating thing about "dies d'agost" (august days) is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to leftist catalan journalist ramon barnils. unless mentioning barnils' name a few times constitutes an "homage," this pretense is an utter fraud. you will learn virtually nothing about barnils in this film nor about the spanish civil war (1936-1939) nor about the special role of catalunya in that war. you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive franco.the footage of the catalan countryside is very beautiful, of course, but "dies d'agost" does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue. the large number of stills shown -- not very illuminating images of the forest floor, for example -- is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here. the aimless drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema. on the contrary, one's strongest impression is of a film made by and for spaced-out, middle-aged hippies. don't waste your time. read a good book about the spanish civil war instead. (i recommend felix morrow's scathingly anti-stalinist "revolution and counter-revolution in spain," which contains a gripping account of the 1937 barcelona uprising.)barry freed

if you are a catalan nationalist anarcho-socialist with unnuanced reverence for the mythologies of the spanish republic, this movie may be for you. two brothers, real-life ones (one of them being marc recha himself), re-enact a fictional version of a real-life journey they had made through the spectacular catalan countryside, and history is evoked (pans of bullet-holed walls, artillery booms on the soundtrack) but not shown. there is very little dialog, and most of it is incidental: the story is told in a third-person voice-over, the voice being that of an actress impersonating the real-life sister of the real-life brothers. the images have little to do with what story line there is, which isn't much. many are stunning, brooding pans across stark semi-arid mountains and rivers (think terrence malick or gus van sant -- there's not a little of both "gerry" and "last days" here), interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames. these are best enjoyed within the film's superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music (some quite good, some rather odd, but all gratuitous). the best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences, with their occasional comment-less inclusion of power stations and dams.the relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic; a major character is a man-biting catfish, never shown. the more the catalano-nationalist anarcho-whateverist commitments of the director are suggested, the more the film's richer, unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes. though the director said at the nyff screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its third-person narrative, i'd like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog -- the result might be more moving, and would in any case not be that much less baffling.meantime, this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object (the bathing suit he had been wearing?) dangling from his penis. this is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is (sorry) pricked by something that's actually happening on screen (what is that? why's it hanging there?), but, as usual, no answers are provided. very warholian, very sixties, and a not a little tiresome.

jason connery is not an actor; he is the son of an actor. his macbeth is the worst i have ever seen. oh yes, he murders king duncan, but he also kills william shakespeare. his wife is even worse. please, give me polanski's version on dvd, so i can forget this monster. jon finch, orson welles, laurence olivier, there you have actors!

i have just watched this "latest" version of macbeth and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a fully fledged watchable movie.one note however, the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of samplers as opposed to a full orchestral score. i think paul farrer needs to get his act together!!!

i had high hopes for this production, being one of my favourite works.indeed, a lot of it is reasonable: helen baxendale is not a bad lady macbeth, but lacks the devilry which the original character is infused with. many of the minor characters do well, and the scottish settings are superb.the big disappointment to me is jason connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines off a cue card with the wrong glasses - surely for the first time, as well. he can do so much better. any production when compared to the sublime ian mckellen (macbeth 1979)who to my mind gave the gold standard performance, is going to struggle to be appreciated, but i actually fell asleep and had to rewind this one before i could get through it - hardly a great sign.honestly, one to avoid.

macbeth, i've always thought, is the most accessible of shakespeare's 'great period' plays. compact, focused, with heaps of violence, it should have been the play most open to screen adaptations. i'm not aware of a really good rendering of the story, however - the best effort being orson welles's vigorous shoestring version. to the list of macbotches we must add the connery/baxendale effort.(it seems it was not a 'film adaptation' at all, but a tv version that was given a theatrical release, post luhrman's romeo + juliet and branagh's hamlet. that might explain some of its flaws, but doesn't excuse them.) it starts well, with a feisty battle sequence with pleasingly grisly witches looking on. poor old gray malkin and paddock are cut from the opening scene, but they aren't alone for long. in quick order they are joined by the bloodied sargent and his account of the battle, the treachery of the thane of cawdor, the luckless master o' the tiger, even macbeth's meeting with duncan when he is invested as thane of cawdor. all of these had virtues that plead like angels trumpet tongued against the dark damnation of their sending off, but sent off they are. these aren't the only cuts, either. this is macbeth in a hurry.from the opening battle we are pitched directly into macbeth's encounter with the witches, which is well done. brian blessed, curiously, directed the witchy sequences, and he has great fun with the special effects as macbeth and banquo are told of their fates. jason connery as macbeth is awkward, obviously unsure what to make of the verse. graham mactavish as banquo, on the other hand, is capable, making his lines natural and easy. within a few minutes of connery's mumbling, the viewer is struck the urge to see the roles reversed and mactavish in the title role. no wonder macbeth felt he needed to kill him.these first few minutes marks the high point of the film. from there we move to helen baxendale receiving word of her husband. she's as lost as connery, and denied the beard that he gets to hide behind. her "unsex me here" invocation of evil is embarrassing, not unsettling. there are some reasonably clever touches - macbeth's "we will speak further" is not a sign of his hesitancy in the face of his wife's wicked ambition, but his attempt to silence her prattling as he throws her onto the bed.the acting of the leads is the biggest let down. connery's method consists of staring glazedly about the screen while he mumbles his monologues via voice-over. baxendale looks pinched and neurotic. an attempt to do something interesting with "is this a dagger" - the fantastical dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar - falls flat due to connery's poor delivery and sloppy direction, which mars the production throughout. we accompany lady macbeth back into the murder chamber, where she gets to stab the reviving duncan, but the effect is comic, not dramatic.big scenes are botched - the appearance of banquo at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix subjective rendering of macbeth's delusion with what those around him see, or don't see. the second meeting with the witches is even less coherent, and the prophetic visions are confusing. timing seems to be an issue here - banquo's banquet is the centrepoint of the play, but the film moves rapidly towards conclusion after it, giving it an unbalanced feel and no scope for the intricacies of the riddles macbeth is caught in to be appreciated, or for his descent into madness to be convincing. another crucial cut is the scene where malcolm tests macduff, and macduff learns of the murder of his family. this robs his revenge of most of its emotional force - and the character of a lot of the screen time. he's a virtual stranger when he turns up to kill macbeth.a point for trying. mactavish's banquo earns another. the first few minutes garners another. but that's all. from then on it's sound and fury blah blah blah.

this film, had it been done properly, has so much potential. parody films are always funny, and people tend to like them because they're light hearted, stupid and silly but fun. this film was funny in some parts, but it could have been a lot funnier. the acting itself was ok from all the actors, but...i wasn't satisfied. it seemed a tad empty, and my summary title says it all about the effects. proper green screens weren't used for this movie...backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible. no wonder this film went straight to dvd lol. it wasn't all a total loss, it is funny and will give you a good laugh (at it, not with it most of the time).

except for the appearance of talented austin powers impersonator richard halpern, this pic was your run of the mill movie spoof. dated movie references will not help audiences that may come across this endeavor in future. watch for "groovy" austin powers in the hot tub. it's a hoot and a half.poor special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous starlets in skimpy outfits, so at least that should keep one entertained (if that's what thrills you).for my money, i would rent the dvd of classic spoofs such as "airplane" or "lobster man from mars".

this is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which i have now demystifed).first, did the film makers understand the concept of 'parody' before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film? parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock, comment on, or pay homage through self-depreciating humour to, the original work. in other words, there should be reasons to parody such work, and they should definitely be clever. i didn't see any of those in the film. i did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. bryan stoller probably went to eric roberts and said "hey, i was drunk last night, watching survivors, and had this brain fart for a straight to dvd release. i want you on board without reading the script...because i plan to direct this film without one!" and herein lies the second mystery: eric robert's career. i use to think eric roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. now i realize it's because he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career that he had). after watching this movie, it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films, which has higher budgets, more...intense...scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more elaborate and compelling plot lines, and a much wider audience than this b-movie reject (c-movie?).

there was a time when michael jackson was revered as the king of pop. then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps. finally, it is now the time that we feel truly sorry for this man.this 'movie' is another reason to. i promised a rabid michael jackson fan to watch it with her. you know the type of fan -- someone who tells him- or herself to like everything the object of affection ever did. while watching this movie, which she had seen twice already, i realized how far this fandom goes. probably far enough to rate this movie above a 1/10, as some people miraculously did.the movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series, most notably cast away, lost and jurassic park. unfortunately, it fails miserably at any level. the acting does not save the absolutely horrible story, the filming has the quality of a too-often played video tape, the special effects were better executed in be kind rewind (for those who do not now this movie: with aluminum foil)... all this would be funny if the movie managed to be, well, funny. unfortunately, it is not. it hurts to watch this.and then there is michael jacksons appearance in this garbage. he appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message, and manages to come across as mobile as jabba the hutt and as serious as a 4-year old. just when i thought "who is the terrible person that lured this poor man into participating in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself", i (finally) reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at jackson's neverland ranch. in other words: he. likes. it.this movie, and jackson's involvement in it, is truly disturbing. do not watch it even for the "haha, a movie in the imdb bottom 100" effect. or be warned.

as an indie filmmaker, i try to at least make a decent film . this piece of ____ was beyond low budget. it was shot on video and not 24p mini-dv at least. the look and feel of this was just baaaad. i met the director a few years ago at showbiz expo in la and he was talking about that book, film-making for dummies that he was putting together. i thought this little video was going to be something but i guess i was wrong. he could have brought the value up a little by shooting 16mm film instead of that awful video. the plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine yards. i had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. damn!!!!! i did buy joyride which was a hell of a movie. maybe the director should read real motion picture books on film-making and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget flick. maybe he should learn from the masters who made, night of the living dead and the evil dead and chain saw massacre. just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits. this is one video that should have stayed dead. i cannot call it a film because he did not use film.

holy sweet murder this is quite possibly the least funny movie i've ever seen. you can take my word for this as truth because it's playing on television right now. it's really one of the most pathetic productions i've ever seen. there is not a single redeemable aspect of this flick. it just lacks any humor whatsoever. the only good thing it possibly has going for it is that it's so unfunny that it's wholly unmemorable. in fact, i just sat through some ridiculous sub-plot and i can't really tell you what went on. the only reason i can even possibly remember having seen this movie is because it's so absolutely humorless it will stick in my mind forever based on that alone.an absolutely must miss. if your friend wants to show it to you, shoot him and save yourself the boredom.

warning!! this review may contain spoilers. the back of the box is misleading. it says all this crap about kids telling ghost stories, which they do, but then it implies that they will all be killed by some killer in the woods. this doesn't happen. the stories they tell are a little interesting, specifically the one with the dog and all that licking, but most are rather boring, monsters in the woods, some mute girl, and the main one, the whole movie.

the movie had an interesting surprise. somewhat psychologically gripping. and the makers could have ended it tastefully without making it just another of a rash of movies put out by hollywood promoting homosexuality and/or other sexual deviances. this could have ended with a "pay-off", but there were other motives behind the pen. what torques me off is that the mud slung in your face after you've seen the whole movie. like the disappointing "the talented mr. ripley". yeah sure, i'm just another puritan. this gay content tarnished the whole film. i wouldn't positively judge a movie for artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote an ulterior political motivation, more so for this.

this is really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. furthermore, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced. nothing happens in this film, you would expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. the plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger that they pick up from the high way. the couple invite the stranger to stay with them, because he is homeless. at this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right? no they just kiss and thats it. also, this film contains no action, no comedy, no drama, and not even suspense. makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script!!!!

it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting. it happens quite often. not only is dark harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise. a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble.some movies build tension by building the story. dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it. i was hoping that like other movies, the suspense would finally explode. it never does. also, the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. they may act one way in one scene, but then act a completely different way in another scene. at first, you think that they are merely out of character, but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. they are just props for the final twist. the final ten minutes try to be shocking. instead, it's rather lame and uninteresting. the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long.this isn't one of those low-budget gems. it's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home.

this is a classic b type movie that you'd rather not waste your time and see. it started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller, but i was mistaking. all movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a tensed thriller, but that doesn't happen. it runs slowly and peacefully til the end, with nothing interesting in it. just the ending was unexpected and original, but that's it. vote: 2.5 out of 10. oh, one more thing. why is this movie rated r anyway???

i was an extra on this film but wish i wasn't because its rubbish. the worst thing about this film is the music but the acting, script, editing, directing and story are terrible as well. the main reason its bad is because the budget is so low and the only way to make good film on a low budget is to have a good script. the script which should have been ripped up before the film was made isn't funny, i didn't laugh once. what did make me laugh is how makers probably think the most important thing was getting the film made, who cares if its total rubbish. the film needed about million pound more budget and a better writer. the only reason i didn't give the film one out of ten is because i felt sorry for the guy who is gonna lose a few hundred grand making this, if you do go and see it just make sure your drunk at the time. ha ha

i don't even know where to begin...it's is not worth typing a review so i will just quote what another user posted because i agree thoroughly, but i give it 1 / 10 instead of 2 / 10 "i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was. the initial precept was promising, but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful. let's run through the main points. plot - good initial idea but truly terrible development. there were many points when i thought "no, nobody would do something that stupid". the ending was amazingly anticlimactic. characterisation - all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures. i keep trying to think of one that wasn't - possibly the mother, but that's it. music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. direction - totally amateurish. cinematography - doubt they've heard of it. camera angles / stability / zoom levels often really bad. i am totally bemused at how this film has scored so highly. it's the worst movie i've seen at the cinema for years, if not ever."

with matthias hues on the cover and only $3.00, i had to buy it. i enjoyed some moments, like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids, but i only really watched to see matthias hues' scenes. i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end. it was a cross between clint eastwood's "the good, the bad and the ugly" and "for a few dollars more" (a 3 man quick-draw showdown, with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer). apart from that, there's really nothing more i can add. the actors gave good performances, (all except the "assassin droid" whose performance was nothing outside of comical) but the movie really lacked depth and purpose; simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time, so we're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so, until the ball gets rolling. for example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, taking up two-fifths of the movie.the scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the films budget. i don't think we ever did get to see this "perfect city" of new angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached new angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in. the "super-high security" of new angeles was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to matthias' approximation of "at least a hundred men out there".if you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses in this film, then you may want to watch it, simply to "add it to the list". however, if you value 1 and a half hour of your time, or $3.00 of your money, you may want to give this one a miss.

troma founder, lloyd kaufman is the crapkeeper in this anthology film made up of two films that were such celluloid feces that llyod tried to salvage them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in copious amounts of nudity whenever possible. does it work? nope, it's still crap that i'd have to scrape off my boots if i stepped in it.will anyone like this mess? sure, young teen aged mongoloids with the combined iqs of a vienna sausage have to laugh at something, i guess. for those who have brains that are even semi-functioning steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence, even "dude, where's my car" would do.my grade: f

"tales from the crapper" is gory, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and scatological. but that's ok, i was prepared for all that from my previous troma experiences. what i wasn't prepared for is that it's also witless, unfunny and boring. very little of the genuine anarchic spirit of films like "class of nuke'em high" has remained intact; in its place, we get endless fart jokes (to the point where you start wondering if lloyd kaufman is going senile, thinking that adults find loud farting so darn hilarious!) and a cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "film" that even kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place. oh yes, there is plenty of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn film probably offers a better storyline, higher production values, funnier humor, and above all more respect for its intended viewer than this atrocity. p.s: kelly powers aka suzi lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the "how to make your own movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen.

i understand that this was llyod kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the pits. the whole movie is voiced over since the audio reel was junk. the voice overs were so bad and terrible quality. as much as i love troma, they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work. the acting was terrible. one thing i did enjoy from this movie was the quick cameo of trey parker doing the aristocrats joke with a goofy wig on. there are a lot of big director dudes in this movie like james gunn and eli roth (friends of lloyd kaufman). again i think this was llyods attempt of saving a crappy movie and trying not to lose 1000s of dollars. i won't go on and on but this movie was a mess. check out other troma titles.

while the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "turd" was the breast count, but that wasn't enough to make me watch this again. all said and done i'm actually dumber from watching this movie. this was a new low for troma. lloyd kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what i was getting into. this was by far one of the worst ever put out by the troma team. the best place to show this movie would be to invalids, sense they can't get up to change the channel. to conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.

when voting i was going to give a 2 but when seeing that 1 meant awful it hit the nail on the head.the portrayal of native americans as blood thirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me.this is the third film i've seen of d.w. griffiths where races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways.the man isn't able to tell his side of the story so i'm going to try and keep away from attacking mr. griffith personally.in my opinion the three films probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their children's children.films like this probably made for many of the resentments that are still with us..some may say the camera work was great,the action a first for it's time.the positives are far outweighed by the negatives,it's like someone taking $10 from you and giving a dime back to make up for it.

warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham-handed, with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we're americans, we don't run from trouble, we face up to our responsibilities. it also suggests that if you're willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you're un-american. walter huston, looking bored, is the frustrated da, and the "average american family" includes such familiar faces as sally blane (looking a lot like her sister, loretta young) and dickie moore, as an allegedly adorable moppet. both are regularly crowded out of the frame by chic sale, only 47 then but playing an octogenarian civil war veteran, ponderously jumping and "amusingly" nipping at prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we're americans, dag nabbit. his st. vitus dance old-coot performance is tiresome schtick; it's like walter brennan based his entire career on it. william wellman directs efficiently and quickly, much like his earlier "public enemy," but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout -- i.e., they'd probably be rubbed out by the mob.

aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence, this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours.it starts with an interminably long intro where the leeds family is introduced, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely clich√©d pa and ma, and incredibly annoying grandpa (played by charles "chic" sales). while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street. the mobsters flee through the family's house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime.the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the crusading da occasionally interrupting long anti-crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob. it all winds up in a predictable manner.good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating, nat pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the gorgeous sue blane in a small role as the leeds daughter. if you want to watch huston play his early trademark crusading lawman, try 1932's "beast of the city." avoid this one if at all possible.

all those who criticize the sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of italians haven't seen anything until they've gotten a good look at this cornball gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating, you almost want them to be rubbed out.the parents in this clan aren't so bad, but their two little boys--one a total brat, one cloyingly cutesy-poo--are insufferable, while their older good-for-nothing son and pollyanna daughter ably compete for audience contempt. but the granddaddy of them all is, well, granddaddy. as played by chic sale (in full "dag-nabbit!" mode) he serves as the films moral compass, throwing in lots of diatribes about "dang, dirty foreigners" for good measure. if these are the good guys, it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars.not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors, but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating leeds family. the incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further. only walter huston, as the district attorney, elevates the clich√©-riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts.the film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing-the-witness formula, and it doesn't flinch in its depiction of the hard-bitten underworld lifestyle, but there are quite simply better--and less xenophobic--examples in the genre.

a few of my fellow writers have covered this movie's plot elements so i will stick to some of the cuff remarks...1. this is entertaining - but not for the reasons you'd think. it's cheesy but somehow still watchable.2. tamra, daniel's love interest has to be about thirty. the christian girl that dan ignores is way cuter.3. muriel stole his shirt from mr. spock. also, if my guardian angel looks like muriel i'm going to have to apply for a transfer.4. okay... so apparently... dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! what kind of horrible guilt trip is that?! muriel says that it was dan's prayers that kept his parents together. i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous. listen, i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way they'll stay together is if they decide they're going to do it.5. i'll echo the atheist's comments on how this movie portrays non-christians. apparently they're all slovenly bullies.6. for something positive - david white is a decent actor. he gives the movie a little bit of credibility, even if he is the only one. he pretty much holds this film together on his own.

this is a comedy version of "strangers on a train". it works pretty well. i am a harsh grader, so the 3 rating reflects mostly on the characters and plot. the performances are extremely good, all of them. of course, the two stars, devito and crystal, shine most. each performer acts well enough to play off of. the comedy works in a level just short of slapstick. devito characters work best when depraved. his character, portrayed as a writing hack, would probably be more real if he was published and lauded as much as most hacks are. his character would, in real life, have a great agent and multiple solicitations. the characters are one dimensional, which is okay in comedy. but crystals's character is not written very well. his desire to kill the "moma" all of a sudden makes no sense at all. it looks like a pitiful attempt at humor. the pitiful attempts are not too often, and the movie flows fairly well.

danny de vito shows us here he is definitely, indeed infinitely, a better on screen performer than off. he plays the part of owen, a miserable would-be writer with a cranky old mother (delightfully played by anne ramsey) he would like to see dead. billy crystal is larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has an estranged wife he feels the same way about. so owen, after viewing hitchcock's "strangers on a train", suggests they swap murders.as director though, de vito's control is inconsistent as he wastes this clever idea, while his film lurches from the very humorous to the very bland. he and crystal are okay in the lead roles, but the show belongs to anne ramsey as the cantankerous mrs. lift.saturday, june 20, 1992 - video

i've always said that there's nothing to beat the original form: the comics. i've been proved right again. this, like all of the other movie takes on the asterix series, failed to impress. the makers of this movie don't get it that what makes all the other such comic-turned-movies (x-men, superman et al.) ventures successful is that they all deviate from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more watchable. agreed, this movie did deviate, in the sense that this movie was a cross of two asterix books, viz. asterix and the great crossing & asterix and the normans. also, uncharacteristic of the asterix series (save asterix and the secret weapon) , a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced. all this ended up doing was create a childishly immature storyline. the funny parts were very few and far between. all in all, a total waste of time and money watching this, let alone at theaters, even at home.

it's not awful but what a waste... lousy gags, bad music, poor drawings and animation...regarding the impressive number of animators and intervallists on this picture (from, hum... a hundred different studios throughout the world? come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way!) i wonder if one guy on the credits = one drawing! the lines are rough, the 3d work inadequate (i'm not against it, but not in this film) but the backgrounds are corrects. the storyline is rather dumb, far from the precise cleverness of the bd, and obviously aimed at an international audience. to distribute a movie all over the world doesn't mean to take everyone in the world for a simple-minded guy... a cultural object is far more interesting when challenging, even when it is a foreign movie (being french in this case it's even worse!).some new stuff is doing well (the olaf character, sometimes, like with the stone explanation, but it's not great) but the modern references are exasperating (music, sms -not even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird named short message service: does anyone know imagination?). but, hey, it's a m6 / tps production with some celine dion in it... pathetic.asterix is underemployed and obelix talks too much. goudurix could be great (like in the book) but he is too clearly a "cool guy" having a love affair (with an uninteresting made up female character). in fact, only the vikings (wizard excepted) are funny. too much action, not enough laughs. the best part of the movie are the end credits. not the music, but the few stills it contains. bd style. well, definitely, asterix is not made to move!

this asterix is very similar to modern disney cartoons. soulless, technically good and the usual in-jokes for adults. maybe it's because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa: castle in the sky, but it was quite disappointing.the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves asterix and obelix going to the viking's territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well. oh and initially they don't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship... yadda yadda.the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes. the vikings get all the best ones. such as vikea (the viking's chief's wife) giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid. or the vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy (literally). oh, and olaf the dumbest viking is actually hilarious (as much for the voice acting as the dialogue).for example, aboard the viking ship: (after a speech by abba, the captain's daughter) olaf: who is this new guy? captain: that's my daughter, cod-brain! olaf: your... daughter's... a man?

this film is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful with a high budget alone. it's obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated into this: the animation is fluid, detailed and superb- the soundtrack isn't too memorable except for the ending song by celine dion (at least i think it was her). the musical score is powerful full orchestra material. kudos to the animators and music composers! 9/10. however, the story and characters fall flat. it feels very 'been there, done that', predictable and plain uninteresting. the characters have distinct personalities but nothing too likable. they annoyed me to no end. i tried really hard to like this, but i didn't care about the story- it was clich√© action-adventure plot. there were 'jokes' that weren't funny. it was vomit inducing predictable from start to end. the dialogue was clich√© and awful- especially the last line "it's not ... that gives you wings, it's love!" whatever it was, i remember cringing. i was wishing it would hurry up and finish. i wasn't the only one either- the people i went with thought it was boring. please watch the asterix and obelix cleopatra film if you're going to watch any. this was a waste of time.

i think it's the first time that i go inside a theater and go out so disappointed. there were two reasons why i went to see "ast√©rix et les vikings": first as a film buff, and second as a big ast√©rix fan.in the end, the film doesn't satisfy any request. it's simply a big animated mess and it proves that the ast√©rix franchise is going from bad to worse.in fact, it has been this way since the death of first scenarist ren√© goscinny in 1977. his faithful collaborator, illustrator albert uderzo took his place, but the following books were clearly lacking of the quality that was present during the goscinny years."ast√©rix et les vikings" is based on the book "ast√©rix et les normands", which was published during the goscinny reign. the basic story is the same: goudurix, abraracourcix' nephew' arrives to the village and ast√©rix et ob√©lix must turn him into a real man, while the vikings come to gaul in order to discover what fear is, because it seems that fear gives wings.the similarities end here. what follows in the book is a non-stop series of laughs, gags and hilarious dialog with the result that the vikings do discover fear and they flee gaul. the movie is silly, unfunny, fast-paced, corny... well, just name a default and it has good chances of being applied...the difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good. but the new ideas simply crashes it in a bottomless pit. even older ast√©rix movies such as "ast√©rix le gaulois", which almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them are easily better.animation has the quality of other 21st century movies, but it has its faults and any film beginner could find the mistakes. the greatest example is the continuity mistake, where the day follows the night after a fraction of second, in the same sequence.imagine. they took animation studios from numerous countries and they still can't get adequate film-making.the changes of the original story are simply unbearable. and they still could be even if there was no original story. goudurix, in the movie, has a pet pigeon named sms and who act as his cell phone (!). grossebaf, the viking chief, has a rebellious teen daughter named abba (!) and she constantly defies her father's authority. there's also a stupid viking wizard, his cartoonish dumb and muscular son, the faithful bride of grossebaf who is obsessed with decoration (her name is vikea!) and... well i can't stand that much longer.we're far from the original gags from the original book. the biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen, mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen. i remember that the greatest moments in the book were ob√©lix laughing at the invaders' names (which all finish in 'af') and goudurix tries to scare them in ridiculous ways.and if everything wasn't enough, somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there's an already existing c√©line dion song which would be featured in the final credits. if it was a new song, i could have understood. but using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that they're ready to do anything in order to attract film-goers.the only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't walk out of the theater without being left cold. in a summer release, it just can't hurt...the only other acceptable point of the movie is how goudurix becomes courageous. his psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible, while it's better pictured in the movie and the motivation point is more believable.so if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money on it. grab the book instead.oh ren√©, why did you leave us?

hargh... this film is so bad it's almost good. trash at its best. jesus' bro vs. pimps...come on. i'd say that you'd actually have to see this, it's so bad... my sides hurt when i laughed. i can't understand why this isn't in the worst 100.

this film almost gave me a nervous breakdown. when i was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, i had just started teaching in secondary (high) school. the whole teaching business was all a bit nervewracking for a beginner, but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom i decided to watch some rather awful films. the flintstones was one of the films that i chose, and then i put "king of the streets" (the uk title of 'alien warrior') on. just before it finished i found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all...my life, the film stock, the ¬£2 i had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the blockbuster ex rental section, the time it must have taken to print the sleeve art, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as negligable as their efforts were)...the list goes on.i love bad films. let me make this perfectly clear - i love watching crappy films from blockbusters. me and my mate dan used to sit and watch many, many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them. but this was a different type of crappy film. i don't think that anything has come close to this, not even tobe hooper's "death trap" (which is probably my second worst film in the world). the whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me; the repetition of music at any available opportunity, regardless of on-screen events; the whole.... aaaggghhhhhhh!!!!! i can't even carry on with this 'critical' dissection, as my gag reflex has started. the futility of that film, even now, three years after i watched it for the first and last time, still renders me speechless (but i am still able to type). the whole "making a car from odd parts" section had me contemplating horrible things.i implore you, if you are interested in watching this film, just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back. i can almost guarantee that it won't be even half as bad as this film actually is. don't, under any circumstances, contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever. not if you are a christian and you want to see a christ allegory; not if you are a bad movie afictionado and you want to experience the true nadir of trash; not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute). make no mistake about it, this film is unholy. it is the antichrist in video form. as bo cattlett in get shorty said: "i've seen better film on teeth".

imagine if you took the christ myth, mixed it with a healthy dose of porn, against a backdrop of bad sci-fi blackxploitation(brotha from another planet like) throw in a dash of after school special, and lots of really bad kung fu fighting. oh and some decent break dancing. with an awesome casio keyboard soundtrack.and some how they make this even worse than you could imagine. there are at least 4 rape scenes, at least one great car explosion, a buff black guy running around in his undies with an uzi.add alcohol and this is the perfect movie.i mean lots and lots and lots of alcohol

ugh. unfortunately this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. none of the characters are remotely likable, which makes this film difficult to watch. they're all miserable thirty year olds who don't take responsibility for their crummy lives. i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film, so there's a chance things got better afterward, but i doubt it. i can't imagine five people as self-absorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten years.three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing, as they had no relevance to the plot, and were clearly a gratuitous (failed) attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull film.save your time and money, and skip this movie.

synopsis correction: the ending does not show ben cruising online for guys. he is looking up arabic language courses at the presido military acadamy in san francisco. perhaps to join the war in iraq as a translator, (fyi- many of the dishonorable discharges from "d'ont ask d'ont tell have been translators (they are now it major short supply) ben also spoke russian. this movie is a good time capsule of life in manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here. mostly a good laugh at lame social skills and the sad portrayal of "grown up" twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode. also a brief study of the always changing scene in manhatten.(somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same b.s.)watch together the films "englishman in new york"" and the "the new twenty" both good for nostalgia. i think the movie "twenty" shows how far the blur between gay and straight as evolved.these two films are gay time travel for sure!!!!enjoy

talk about marketing. the poster/home video cover of 'the new twenty' broadcasts a half-naked male in a "wolfe video." for those familiar with the gay-themed movies ¬ñ this broadcasts a "must-see." (i loved reading one reviewer (from another site) stating they had been "tricked" into seeing a "sodomite" movie. are you serious? the tagline itself as the word "gay." the lord gives you eyes, yet you cannot see¬Ö) that being said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, no less (see: the lonely gay, the aids victim gay and the closeted gay) it's more about long-term friendship and characters that grow apart. in fact, if anything, there's more (here's one for christians to complain about) heterosexual couples having sex outside of, gasp!, marriage. not to mention backstabbing, drinking to excess and drug usage. i see this more of a made for tv-logo or showtime movie than big screen effort. sure, i loved the cinematography, some of the actors could act and i always love seeing a big-group-of-friends that actually act like they've known each other for a million years. but we've see this all before. nothing really "new" here. barely an original idea ¬ñ hence bringing back the same 'ole "i have aids, let's deal with that" for a good portion of the movie and boy, our friend has a serious drug problem, but let's not deal with that until it's almost too late. that's so (us) 'queer as folk' and 'broken hearts club,' respectfully. the film deals with a group of college buddies, now grown (in size not minds) who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing. strangely, as in most of these independent movies, the most interesting, to me at least, was the heavier-set one, ben. he stole each scene, but, again, there wasn't much to take.

what we're given in this trying-to-be trendy film is a "frat-pack" of college friends, now approaching age 30 (which we all know, of course, their generation thinks of as the "new 20"). consisting of four guys and a gal, we have thrust at us the following types: seemingly "unemployeds" and frequent drug users, along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying-to-be. they are all, in their own way, drifting while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness. with one, possibly two exceptions, these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to modeling myself after. there is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. except in the instance of one individual (who appears on the way to finding it), none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his/her life. and so, about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt "i love you."with only the exceptions mentioned, these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories.ps--writer/director, johnson, definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes----with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones. why might that be?****

"the new twenty" is one of the worst films i have ever seen. yes, some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse, but i would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic "indie" film that pretends to be more is worse. "the new twenty" was written and directed by chris mason johnson, and i will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that i wasted on his film.the screenplay & charactersfrom beginning to end, the screenplay failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail. in story telling, the three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man, man vs. the world, and man vs. himself. the screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in new york, and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs. himself, where each of the film's characters are so self-absorbed in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the movie atrophies before the audiences very eyes. each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior (heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict; a fianc√©e who has sex with her fianc√©e's boss/investor, even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character; a man who begins as a decent guy, but is attracted to a foul-mouthed investor, and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foul-mouthed business jackass; a closeted chubby gay cyber geek, who does nothing, but find dates online; and a gay asian man who dates an hiv positive older man, but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops).crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and self- loathing of the fianc√©e that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag; the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a "gordon gecko" type character and become a jackass; a story line for the chubby cyber geek; and more scenes of interaction between the asian man and hiv positive boyfriend are all missing.without proper establishing details, all of the characters' actions seem forced and contrived.direction, cinematography & scorei found mr. johnson's direction to be without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. the cinematography can be described as mundane at best. mr. johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of new york city. this failure created a claustrophobic film, that viewed like the filming of a stage play, and not a film.the score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. i assume that mr. johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot.conclusion"the new twenty" is an annoying and unmitigated failure in film-making.

six stars for paul newman's portrayal of general groves, negative four for the inclusion of a highly fictionalized event where the truth is well documented. michael merriman did not really exist. his character--or at least his fate--is based loosely on that of louis slotin, a canadian physicist who did not come to los alamos until after the war. he conducted his lethal "tail of the dragon" experiment in may 1946. this is a critical point. the effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the hiroshima and nagasaki blasts. had anyone died of radiation poisoning at los alamos before the trinity test, it's very possible that the scientists would have abruptly stopped their work, and history would have been changed. whether for the better or the worse we can only speculate. someone should ask the producers and the director whether they added merriman's character for dramatic effect or to deliver an anti-nuclear message. for a more even-handed and accurate treatment of events at los alamos during the manhattan project, see the tv movie, "day one," or better yet, read the peter wyden book on which it is based.

well, since it's called porno holocaust and directed by joe d'amato, i went into this film expecting sleaze...and while i somewhat got it, porno holocaust was a massive disappointment as it's just so damned boring. the title suggests that the film will feature porn, and that's not wrong - porno holocaust is pretty much just porn, and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again, i was fast forwarding before the end. the first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up, but after that it just degenerates into normal porn, and the rest of the film (for the first hour!) is made up of talking, and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through! the plot focuses on a deserted island where, believe it or not, something strange is going on. naturally, it's not long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientists, who all happen to be sexy women, land on the island. they have sex a few times and some strange things happen, then over an hour later they're attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies...this must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno - a zombie who likes to get it on, but unsurprisingly it doesn't work well at all. the film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark, and that is far too long for a film like this. i have no idea why porno holocaust is as long as it is; if they'd just snipped one minute out of every sex scene, the film would have been under ninety minutes, and that would have made it much more tolerable! the zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear (it's quite a long time before there's a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place), and when it does finally appear, it's a huge disappointment! i realise that this is low budget b-movie trash, but d'amato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this! i'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting, atmosphere etc, there's no point. porno holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror, and i can't recommend it!

d'amato's hardcore/horror hybrid doesn't really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premise, wherein various vapid contemporary types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments, but for the most part the film is so slow, the action so dreary and the cast so clearly repulsed to be having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a chore to watch.this is a pity, because the film sets up a promising idea. a group of scientists are taken to the atoll by a naval officer in a small vessel. the scientists ¬ñ three women and two men ¬ñ are an intriguing cross section of sexual types, suffering to various degrees from nymphomania, co-dependency and frigidity; there's even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women stops off at a brothel to get serviced by two hunky caribbean studs for hire. the creature himself ¬ñ a mangled native islander with a horribly scarred face and an unfeasibly long pizzle ¬ñ bears some affinities with the old creature from the black lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has hovered over postmodern man since the cold war commenced, despite those of us in the west having retreated into hedonism and relativistic science.porno holocaust certainly is a film which shows the post-sexual revolution westerners coming across their mirror image in a nuclear monster, yet the torpidity with which it unfolds really lets down the fierceness of the idea. there is a promising interplay of action shots with pov shots, which suggest that the monster (who looks/stalks on as horror monsters from their pov position tend to do) is akin to the voyeur in the audience getting off on the sex between the "beautiful people." the sight of the monster forcing a gorgeous young woman to suck his over-sized member certainly throws the target audience's ugly fantasies in their face. but d'amato has developed similar ideas better in other films, and porno holocaust is a potentially fierce idea let down by the execution (even d'amato's usual cinematographic skills let him down with much dreary camera-work).

it's strange, while the film features full x-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it never feels as shocking as it ought to.a group of scientists go to an island in the caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident. upon their arrival, a mutated islander goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women. doesn't it always seem to work out that way.among the sored acts we find a some lesbian encounters, a three-way with male prostitutes, assorted heterosexual couplings and the rape of an already dead body. even though it's all fully explicit, it fails to ever shock or stir as it is meant to. as soon as the sex goes fully pornographic it just loses it's edge; the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize we are just watching people having sex.there is some blood and gore with the murders, but given that this is a d'amato flick it's really tame. for a much more rounded experience watch the similar 'erotic nights of the living dead'.2/10

as a serious horror fan, i get that certain marketing ploys are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. so i wouldn't call it naivet√© that i assumed this was softcore horror ripping off cannibal / zombi / jungle holocaust. unfortunately, i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore. i should have realized that when i saw the odd "no actual or identifiable minor was used" warning. notice the identifiable part as though he is daring us to catch him? a group of scientists, half of whom are pretty women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a penchant for 69ing on the beach, in search for a mutated native killing villagers. due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island, the radiation turned this last man into a rapist/ killer.writer/ actor george eastman is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on. the sex scenes are whacked out. women walk around nude exuding a strange overconfidence and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down. well, two chicks slapping each other naturally turns into a lesbo scene because women are horndogs. i saw the chick toss another chicks salad and finger herself.if there is anything you should know about this film, it is that. because the rest of this insane movie is just the same. oh, who am i kidding? there is a ton more to tell here. like the white "duchess" that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a parlor. or the "duchess" taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself. when he refuses her advances, she starts crying. so being the good gentleman he is, he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members. i was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the "duchess" to ask if there is any other way to pay him.and all of this happens before they depart for the island to conduct their research. wait, i thought this was a zombie flick? but the zombie doesn't enter until the 73min mark, but by that time everyone else has been "entered" plenty. i found myself hitting fast forward a few scenes¬Öor several. this is my first splatter porn flick and i don't think it does that subgenre any justice. i guess it is the woman in me talking when i say that i would like more plot and less sweaty, slobbering, hairy sex. funny thing is this could have worked as a decent horror film as the idea of atomic bombing mutating a bitter man and killing his family, was a good one. even eastman's character shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating. it makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself that was disgusted.i don't feel like going into the sound or film quality because you should have already guessed it was bad. this production was shot back to back with 3 other movies including erotic nights of the living dead, which sports most of the same cast. eastman has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck. nevermind, i feel like talking about the sound suddenly. the sound was weird during the sex scenes because while the cast is speaking italian, it seems as though they recorded english voiceovers and played that over their dialogue. so while 2 people are boning, i can clearly hear someone in the background say, "no! yes! wonderful! wait!" there was a slightly amusing italian score that couldn't save this movie. the sfx were minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes. and i would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes as the bright warning label said on the dvd cover (ahem, another marketing ploy), so no fear there. only fear the bad movie.presented in widescreen 1.85:1 aspect ratio. i watched the region 1 not rated version running at 113min released in 2005 by exploitation digital. there is apparently a xxx version by alfa digital, which is the same running time, so i doubt anything is different. prices vary, but you shouldn't pay more than $25.00 for a copy. or as i would recommend, pay nothing and pretend it doesn't exist.favorite quote: shipmate, "civilians are bad luck. women are bad luck. they're scientists too? they must really be monsters." dvd extras: original trailer with hardcore shots & kills to make it look more interesting than it is, trailers for ss hell camp, emmanuelle, & enotld, and a very informative interview with eastman.bottom line: lame porno, but even weaker as a horror film. either get real porn or watch real horror.rating: 3/10 by molly celaschi www.horroryearbook.com

joe d'amato might have made some other notable movies in his very long and very prolific career- prolific, of course, by turns of making very cheap z-grade movies in italy's big exploitation boom of the late 70s early 70s- but porno holocaust isn't one of them, or at least shouldn't be. granted, i should not expect much from a movie with such a title, but i thought considering the back of the box's description that it might have some fun horror scenes with the "horny, mutant, cannibal zombie". turns out the zombie doesn't appear until more than halfway into the movie, and at every turn we get instead a tawdry sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine. which is fine. but it's not very enjoyable, except in the most "what the f*** is this bs" kind of way. there's laughable dialog involving lobsters costing more from mail-order japan than in paris, hot, slim women play biologists and zoologists who have particular sexual hang-ups (letting the door be unlocked to be raped, and a bi-polar kind of enjoyment out of getting gang-banged).it all leads up to the island, where the "main attraction" is a guy who early on just spends an absolutely pathetic (forget ludicrous) amount of time just staring at the newcomers to the radioactive wasteland of the shot-on-caribbean island, and once revealed has a face like one of the guards in jabba's palace and has a sweet potato for a main genital. but much dumber than anything before it is the "relationship" that develops between the monster and a dark-skinned lady who has an inordinate amount of time to escape, but just sits there, blank-faced, as the monster brings gifts and for what must be a racially-motivated exploitation move on the part of the filmmakers the monster only rapes and kills the white women, and not her. and it ends, of course, with a "happy" ending. i use quotes, of course, out of a kind of shock that this could have any kind of legitimate ending at all.bottom line, this is not what you might expect, as possibly being a bloody horror movie with plenty of tacky but cool looking italian monster-zombies devouring human flesh. if anything what violence is in the film is done on a shoe-string; a log hit to the face is immediately cut to the bloody aftermath, which is like the aftermath of a tomato hitting someone. so really, the last part of the title is meant more for market sake. yet even as a porno movie it has little to go on except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation to the caribbean (as an interview with george eastman suggests, this was just one of a few quickies made while on the island). its got penny-bought schlocky camera-work and similar actors, filled with genitalia about 3/4 of the whole time and with wretched lip-syncing and music like nino rota forced at gun-point to make something snappy in a bordello, and it's still a piece of celluloid dung all the same; all of this could be an immense guilty pleasure, but it isn't.

wow. i felt like i needed to shower off after watching this one, but maybe there were other reasons that i will leave to your imagination. i felt used and abused after wacking, i mean watching this film. hairy chests, thick mustaches, and well, hairy everything describes this porn/horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without the hair.as a horror flick, this bites. but as a piece of exploitation/porn from italy's rich cinematic history- it definitely has a place in my library. the copy i have is in italian with english subtitles. i wish it had the really poorly dubbed english, i think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed. the only white guy who gets laid in the movie is "mark shannon"- he is the moustache wearing, hairy chested piece of machismo who really does try and give a performance every time he "steps up to bat". this was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic. nothing like panning the camera from a tropical backdrop to a hairy man having "doggie-style" sex with a woman. i can't help but laugh.this is one of those movies that i pray my future wife and kids never find.

one of a few movies filmed at coronado high school in scottsdale, az in the late 80's as well as just one of the guys, bill and ted's excellent adventure and just perfect (which was a segmented movie played during the mickey mouse club.) movie is definitely for kids as the previous comments have it pretty right on. coronado has gone through an overhaul in the past couple of years and many of the buildings seen in this film are now gone. the field where they are playing catch is adjacent to the football field, one of the few areas still there. the internal scenes near the lockers i believe were in the old 200 building.unless it is playing late at night on the disney channel it may be a very hard to find flick. how they ever made sequels to this is beyond me.

first off, i refuse to even consider this piece of work a music video... i consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song "thriller" in its soundtrack. to me a music video must be no longer than the song itself, and the song must play the entire length of the video. calling this a music video is like calling the great gatsby a poem. on top of this... let's face it... "thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the extremely dated werewolf transformation, the mindless vincent price poem (just because vp recites it doesn't mean it's not lame), and the least threatening zombies i have ever seen. sure, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but don't forget, this also happened at the same time the a-team was the #1 show on tv, so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one... one last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos... what exactly did this add to the equation that "billie jean" and "beat it" didn't already add? from what i can tell, it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog, or a superfluous dance scene... so you could say that all this video really did was give puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos... not quite my definition of great

i've seen several of these body snatcher type movies, but none was nearly as bad as this one.no thrill, no fx, bad acting, bad photography, bad sound, bad everything.blue jello eats'em all!

the opening was a steal from "eight-legged freaks", a film that is everything this one isn't. stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply - along with others that can't be repeated..! drifter type returns to his home(?)town, meets up with old friends etc.... the usual annoying kid, single mother,local loudmouth and so on..bad special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances, (hey, didn't the director see "close encounters"?). good acting? good story? good camera angles? good cutting? not here! do not rent, unless you are sharing the cost and have a lot of beer handy. do not watch on tv, go and drink a lot of beer instead - you'll enjoy it more!

this film is so unbelievably awful! everything about it was rubbish. you cant say anything good about this film, the acting, script, directing, effects are all just as bad as each other. even ed wood could have done a better job than this. i seriously recommended staying away from this movie unless you want to waste about 100mins of your life or however long the film was. i forget. this is the first time i wrote a comment about a film on imdb, but this film was just on tv and i had to let the world of movie lovers know that this film sucked balls!!!!!!!!!!!! so if you have any decency left in you. go and rent a much better bad movie like critters 3

i cannot believe i sat through this utter waste of time. i was just too fascinated by how unspeakably bad it was that i couldn't move. it reminded me of the feeling when you can't take your eyes away from a horrible car crash or the rotting carcass of a cow. you can't help but look, but you feel sick and nauseated afterward.let me elaborate: "plan 9 from outer space", for instance, is not a bad movie. not even "star wars: holiday special" is a bad movie. they both are awful to watch, for sure, but they both have some qualities and at least they leave you the strength to reach for the "off"-button.this "remake" (in name only) of the sci-fi classic left me weeping on my couch, desperately trying to come to terms with why such scripts get filmed, why anyone would soil the memory of the original classic, and whether or not i could resume my normal life without my suddenly acquired longing for the quiet and peace of death.although death, i realized, would offer no rest from the horrid memories of this pile of crap, as the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it over and over again for eternity...

they've shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it. the bad acting isn't enough... the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists. i love the original from 1953 so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead. because this one is such a bore.

alien body-snatchers in the desert. little blue rocks that look like they are made from cheap plastic. the overall storyline isn't bad if you like that kind of thing but the acting is so far beyond poor that it amazes me that some of them actually entertained my in the x files! and the special effects? hello?! where did they get their fx crew from, secondary school? i mean, come on; there was so much more they could have done! it was amateur and extremely basic. i didn't particularly enjoy it (and my dad fell asleep during it!) and of course our hero falls in love with the leading lady! its so typical and highly predictable. bleugh!!!!!

this is a pretty pointless remake. starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece chiller that was. the new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy.brian kerwin plays a 'city boy' photographer who returns to a semi-abandoned desert town populated by a scattering of underdeveloped clich√©d stock characters: the lollipop sucking daby-doll lolita, the 'ornery old coot prospector, the crippled vet and his asian wife, etc...kerwin's character witnesses the crashing of 'something' into a hillside and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of weird blue rock are scattered around. the temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area vanishes, people start to act weirdly, things explode. kerwin's character gets in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in one movie. the film develops no sense of place, no character development, no humour, no tension. everything that made the jack arnold's original a creepy little cold-war paranoia classic has been abandoned. it just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends.the special effects aren't very special - the interior of the ship looks like bits of cling film wrapped round some ropes which were then dangled in front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wire-work ever put onto the screen. the script is repetitive - everyone says everything at least twice, kerwin gets to say "let's get out of here" at least three times during the movie, twice in one scene. loads of things are left unexplained at the end - why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example? - not that anyone watching would care; if the film makers didn't care why should we?the acting is adequate - better than the script, which at times, has an under-rehearsed improvisational quality, deserves. though often the actors look like they just want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible - a notable example of this is when elizabeth pe√±a registers the briefest, token moment of "frustrated despair hands to face gesture" before following sulking son stevie outside to watch him do "angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table" gesture. continuity errors include the (gb) sticker on the back of kerwin's jeep appearing and disappearing, a double action of the gas in the exploding car, a towns-person being in two places simultaneously - once in the alien stevie's pov shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot, elizabeth pe√±a appearing to shut a car door twice... you can tell i was gripped can't you? the movie commits that greatest of errors. it's boring.

based on a ray bradbury story; a professional photographer(brian kerwin)returns to his modest home near a tiny desert town, where most of the citizens wishes he stayed away. a lonely boy(jonathan carrasco) latches onto him for the attention; and the two witness the landing of an alien craft in the rocky region of the desert. the aliens turn themselves into the images of townspeople. kerwin must convince evacuation of the town and falls in love with the young boy's mother(elizabeth pena). acting is pretty shallow; the story line is no worse than some others; this movie leaves you feeling that you got shorted on a decent ending. supporting cast includes: howard morris, dean norris and mickey jones.

having seen carlo lizzani's documentary on luchino visconti, i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low. but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied... i faced a need for critical opinion, which i generally don't like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer. there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally. but when i read the reviews already written on this title, i also felt a bit confused. people sometimes don't know what to criticize. therefore, to be clear, i'll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably: the former one about visconti before his director's career and latter one about visconti the director. the aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents' divorce. we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano: in riches galore, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in true aristocracy. for instance, his father's splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that. there is also an emphasis on visconti's crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people ("left wingers") who later had impact on his style and message in art. that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing (a contrast at first sight). however, the part about his director's career, which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the director's death in 1976, is poorly executed. his movies are not discussed well. why? because there are very few people who really have something to say. franco zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right. there are also some interviews with franco rosi. but later, such movies like il gattopardo, la caduta dei rei, la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger. although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig, i did not like the interviews of his. moreover, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary... there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece, there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster. a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made. there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit. franco zeffirelli, though i appreciate him as a director, makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious. for instance, he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service. therefore, i say: simplified and unsatisfactory. what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself. as a result, we may get his own opinion about his works. for instance, i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig.i believe it is better to see luchino visconti (1999) by carlo lizzani than this doc. although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will get a better idea of the director. visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people's emotions and viewpoints into stone... 4/10

how dare you? adam low, without apparent shame, puts his name to this fake tribute. it's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the great visconti's work. yes it's long and portentous, yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that, most people interested on the subject, have already seen. but what resounds the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the gossip. the last and loudest voice comes from a third rate german actor, ranting and raving. the appropriately named mr.low directed this, hoping, i imagine, to get better ratings than his previous, more to the point, but deadly boring documentary on kurosawa. well i have news for you mr low and your cohorts. you missed a great opportunity and i for one, won't give you another.

luchino visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but adam low (the director of this thing) allows the stronger voice to be helmut berger's! how can it be? what a missed opportunity! we come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all. the beautiful images belong to visconti's world, the embarrassing interviews to the likes of berger and zeffirelli to adam low's tiny little world. a must to avoid!

luchino visconti, the artist with the sword. courage should be the first word associated with his entire opus. film. theater. music. revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. a legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. he introduced the neorealism through the work of an american novelist james cain in "ossesione" he gave anna magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career. he gave us alain delon and maria callas. but the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain adam low and the voice of helmut berger. what a terrible fate.for those interested, there is a 61 minute documentary by director carlo lizzani (a man who really knew visconti) titled luchino visconti a portrait. it is out on dvd distributed by image entertainment

i, like most other people, saw this movie after hearing of it from patton oswalt. oddly enough, it was easier to find than i thought it would be. though, it shouldn't come as a surprise that i found it used.the plot is summed upped masterfully within the title. it's a bed that eats. nothing more, nothing less. there is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good one.a demon's blood ended up on a bed and, as a result, it becomes possessed. it devours anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange fanta. there is an artist who fell victim to the bed, but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it inhabits. the narrative is told entirely through him.this movie fails horribly at everything, even at being bad. still, it's not without its own brand of charm.

ok, this is one strange film! fans of ed wood jr. will appreciate the "inventive" techniques director george barry utilizes, like stock footage and cheesy voice overs. he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device! there is more humor than horror here, but i found it an uneven blend. you will be laughing and crying, and probably wondering why you got your hands on this. barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972, and was completed in 1977, at a cost of $10,000. that's 59 months and $9,900 too much! if you like your cheese on the campy side, with vintage '70s "gore", you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack.

i first heard of this film when patton oswalt talked about it on his "werewolves and lollipops" cd. he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. being a lover of terrible cinema, i knew i was in for a treat.this film is, hands down, one of the weirdest i've ever seen. certainly one of the weirdest shlock films. basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now possessed and it now eats. along with fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. the people can range between horny teens, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy throwers. there's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room.most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action. death bed takes another path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what's happening while slow, dull murder scenes take place. also, i must say everyone who's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet. i would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment, it would sting a little. i guess nerve endings weren't invented until 1981 or so.the story is wacky, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are sparse, the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors i've ever seen. probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart-asses are involved. certainly one you shouldn't miss.

it's difficult to criticize a movie with the title like 'deathbed: the bed that eats' and involves a ghost narrator who's trapped behind a 2-way painting he drew and a bed that snores and ¬ñ if i'm not mistaken, masturbates. (now, that's getting back at its human companions!) furthermore, it foams up (in orange, for whatever reason) to absorb edibles lying on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. again it's suffice to say, that don't expect too much when you see what i guess is stomach acid ¬ñ the final remains of anything that orange suds takes ¬ñ dissolving only certain things. it'll drink the wine, but the bottle's okay and it'll eat away at the chicken bone, but the bucket's just fine. heck, the bed even replaces the unused containers. hilariously, at one point it downs pepto-bismol. i had to laugh at that one. i don't think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously. it's low budget, and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money. i thought, in a world where there can be a killer 'lift' and a 'blood beach,' this 'deathbed' might be amusing to watch. for reasons that might involve cost, 90% of the film is voice-over, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright/confusion on why a bed would attack (i can think of one ¬ñ and i never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed) and you'll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. (a victim loses all flesh on his hands, barely saying "ow.") only one scene, that went on too long, was minutely tense ¬ñ a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back, using a sheet. where are the mst3k guys?

this movie was really stupid and i thought that it wasn't so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people. then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie. i could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes. the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right. without muscles, you really can't move your hands but he did. the brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands. the movie wasn't great but it was okay until the hand scene. i was laughing so hard that i don't really remember how it ended. it had something to do with foam or something.

when i attended college in the early 70s, it was a simpler time. except for a brief occurrence in 1994, i've been totally free of the influence of illegal substances ever since and i've never regretted it...until now. db:tbte has got to be, hands-down, the best movie to watch when stoned. the odd, dreamlike state it creates is very strange when you're not smoking anything, but i'm sure that it would seem completely normal after a big doobie. (not that i'm recommending this, you understand.) the soothing narration, provided, as it usually is in quality cinema, by a tb victim trapped in a painting, would be ideal to help the stoned viewer to follow along as things get complicated. plus, everything in the film is pretty organic...from old-fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken.now, there's also no question that the young man with the (ahem) "hand problem" is absolutely sailing away in the film. at one point, you just know that he's going to say, "hey! when i move my hand, it leaves trails!!" trust me...you'll know when you get to that point.the only other thing we have to address is this: how good can a film be when at least half the budget was spent on moving a huge bed frame around for interior and exterior shots? definitely a must-see for horror aficionados, but suitable for the general audiences under the right conditions (if you know what i mean, and i think that you do). it only earns four stars because i can't actually say that it took any talent to make.

i had read online reviews praising this obscure outing as a combination of gory horror, quirky black comedy and borderline art-house; the film has elements of all three, to be sure, but they are at the service of such a supremely silly premise (the title immediately gives the game away) ¬ñ and amateurish production to boot ¬ñ that its long-term neglect due to a lack of proper distribution ¬ñ basically until cult epics picked it up for dvd release a full 30 years after its inception! ¬ñ was no great loss to cinema or even the genre(s). the bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a demon's dalliance with a woman; anyway, a dying man who had made use of the four-poster and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the canvas(!) and provides intermittent commentary to the 'action'. several people (from teenagers-on-a-fling to gangsters-in-hiding) supply fodder to the perennially-hungry bed; latest on the menu are a trio of girls ¬ñ one of whom, however, recalls its mistress of long ago and, consequently, the bed seemingly fears her! seeing various objects ¬ñ from cigars to pieces of fried chicken ¬ñ and people getting swallowed up (the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honey-colored liquid) makes the film mildly amusing at times (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeletal formation, which he seems to take rather too easily in his stride!), but also awfully repetitious¬Öso that, at even a brief 77 minutes, the whole pointless exercise feels strained and downright desperate.

while everyone does a decent job in this film, i agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a script-less experiment with really talented actors. as such, it isn't enough to hold your attention. having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving dylan mcdermott and a flaming shot glass that i think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as i did; the other is a split-second with an inflatable dinosaur. crispin glover does his usual nutty twitch-fest guy and does it fine, harry dean stanton does his usual nutty patriarch (repo man, anyone?) etc. good cast, not enough to keep it going. just a few gems, seconds long.

man, are you serious? did you read the book or watch this movie? well, if you did, let me warn you, it is bogus. mark furhman has been seeking a job since losing his job with the lapd. you remember him, don't you? he was the guy that lied on the stand and gave the oj simpson defense a foothold they were looking for. well, he has written three books since then. i have read all three of them. no, i am not a fan, they were given to me. however, i will tell you one similarity in all three, they grossly distort the importance of mark furhman. he shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three. in "murder in spokane", he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer, when he had nothing to do with it. in all books he takes great delight in running down local law enforcement efforts. kind of like his efforts were run down in the oj trial. in this movie, there are plenty of slow motion shots of ladies looking at furhman and lusting after him. many other shots have him at the center of attention, when in reality, i am sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was "hey, isn't that the racist that caused oj to get off?" this was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie over it.

i can't believe it! were they crazy in filming a movie about connecticut in southern california? for god's sake, there's palm tree's everywhere. in one of the opening scenes a guy says "welcome to connecticut" and throws down a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "greenwich herald". greenwich connecticut doesn't have a "herald" it has a "times" as in "stamford advocate and the greenwich times." (refering to the stamford, connecticut newspaper). maybe the film makers should have done a little research, i mean my god, at least get the name of the newspaper right, or film in locations that look at least remotely like connecticut.

this movie is trash because, out of many reasons, it is based on mark furman's book, which is also trash. let me must say that mark furhman is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight - and others that right this type of trash belong in jail. for the movie itself, being based on the book, was horrible as well. the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related, thru his aunts marriage, to the kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders - they are just a family and middle america needs to get over the obsession. this poor guy, and his family, have been hounded by the police for years, they couldn't get tommy so they went after micheal. its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he didn't do it, besides the facts that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have kept this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of god, don't watch this garbage

i was so disappointed in this movie. i am very familiar with the case, having read not only mark fuhrman's book but also the far superior "a wealth of evil: the true story of the murder of martha moxley in america's richest community" by timothy dumas. anyone who watches murder in greenwich should be aware they're watching the mark fuhrman story, not the martha moxley story. this film is nothing more than an ego-trip for fuhrman. just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming (yes, even being ogled by women). the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. if there is any hero to this story, it's martha's family, her mother dorothy and brother john. they kept this case alive for two decades before fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself. they, and martha, deserve to have the true story told.

i just saw princess raccoon at the asian film festival in new york. the gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste. "you could be at herbie: fully loaded," he said with a smug smile, "but instead you're here to watch seijun suzuki's princess raccoon." the audience applauded and cheered. well let me tell you, i would have rather watched herbie: fully loaded twice in a row. princess raccoon, an allegedly whimsical musical based on japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films that i have ever seen. it is so wretched that its wretchedness actually makes me dislike other seijun suzuki films, which is quite a feat.there is such a vast expanse of things wrong with princess raccoon that i hardly know where to start. perhaps its worst faults are being both aggressively unintelligible and mind bogglingly monotonous. if the reels got mixed up or if half of them got lost in shipping the audience would not know the difference. if you don't believe me i dare you to steal a print and have someone run the reels in random order. if you can tell me which one goes where i will give you every penny i have.the first third of the film features a mishmash of scenes, songs (including a cringe inducing rap number), and images that don't seem to be related in any way at all. horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain, adding yet another brick to the immense, and rapidly growing, wall of incomprehensibility. it wouldn't surprise me to learn that the writer wrote down any japanese folklore that came to mind of on a bunch of note cards, stacked them up, shuffled them, dealt the cards out on a table, and then wrote the script according to their order.about thirty-five minutes into the film some semblance of a plot arrives on the scene. something about a shape-shifting raccoon princess (in human form) and a regular human falling in love. i hoped that this was be a portent of the film being something other than a series of perplexing scenes, but no such luck. the film continues in the same absolutely baffling manner. i wish i had gotten out then, but i was trapped in the middle of a narrow row. in retrospect it would have been worth the awkward scene.i'm exhausted just thinking about the last couple of reels. i spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over. every big dolly move, swell in music, or scene that looked remotely like it was concluding things renewed my hopes that the credits were about to roll. for agonizing minute after agonizing minute it went on. and on and on and on. finally, after dozens of false alarms, it cut to what i was sure must be an abstract pattern over which credits were about to appear. then, in defiance of all reason, it cut to another scene. how could i forget? the completely unrelated subplot concerning a ninja being captured, urinated on, and boiled in a soup hadn't been wrapped up yet.i'm never going to get those 111 minutes back, but you can spare yourself the pain. unless you want to taint your memory or future enjoyment of great seijun suzuki films like youth of the beast and tokyo drifter do not see princess raccoon. i would have rather spent my time vomiting.

weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops. randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance. none of that explains why this is such a bad film.it's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available. the acting is flat. even the sparkling ziyi zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line. you may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in japan learning to sign and dance. read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense. even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera.the cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap. the editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance. just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent zatoichi - particularly the closing routine - performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language (but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being unsuitable), recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order.

this movie starts off promisingly enough, but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm. the set designs, costumes, and music were wonderful- as close to perfect as one can get. but the more i got into the movie, the more i felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not the audience. although, i loved looking at it, except for a few brief musical scenes, i can't say i enjoyed it. the director shows enormous imagination, but if he had fun with this film, he failed to share that with the audience, or at least with me. i didn't get a sense of whimsy and i didn't get sucked into this universe.a big cause of this was (surprisingly) zhang ziyi. you can tell she's trying very hard, but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish. she's a capable actress but she has her limitations. i've noticed in her acting, that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co-stars, a flaw that creates a void of chemistry. the language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters. she and odagiri act as if they're on separate planets. she's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang, but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that. odagiri was ok but doesn't make much of an impression.i didn't even care for the characters separately. there really is a sore lack of characterization. the only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good-looking royalty. without the compelling love story at the center of the film though, it's hard to care what happens. the film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting. i had to rewind because after going into a subplot i couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline. there were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized.mostly i'm just disappointed because i really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things i do like. the music and dance choreography are really great.the supporting performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing. it's just too bad the lead actors were so bland.

i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with few exceptions - they don't focus on the main disconnect, hence the main split in the audience.on the one side, there are those who are taken by the visual design, pretty costumes, and variety of elements going into the film. some children's movie fans love the colour and animation, and all the un-scary 'magical' effects, shapeshifting animals, and so on. some culture vultures like the complicated references, the layerings of different folklore elements, and the fact that they can watch zhang ziyi singing and quasi-miming, in two different languages, in what really was intended to be a children's comedy.on the other side, there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point, that a blend of folktales is not a tale at all, and that it's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real.in other words, the ideas could be lovely; but when you put them onstage they have to deliver. here, they don't.a good folktale - from any country - has a clear story, a point, and characters who interact strongly with each other. this lacks them all. a few over-sophisticated gestures to opera, western and japanese, are no replacement for a solid theme.as a fantasy fan, i must say that i've sat through some turkeys and loved a few, but this one really tries to do too many things - cheaply. putting in zhang ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome. the other problem isn't that there's no plot; there's half a plot, which means that you keep getting pulled in, then dropped again as another none-too-sharply-executed dance number kicks off.the characters all seem to know that they're starring in a movie. unless you really like watching other peoples' amateur video, this ain't good. i'd like to test this on real children; i think they'd drop it for uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes.

sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the world's foremost detective sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) outwits the nazi's & manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named dr. franz tobel (william post jr.) out of the country & to the relative safety of london. but is london as safe as holmes thinks? dr. tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever & he has agreed to give it to the british government, but those nazi's want it just as badly & holmes arch enemy professor moriarty (lionel atwill) plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight & selling it to the nazi's. add the bumbling inspector lestrade (denis hoey) of scotland yard, dr. tobel's love interest charlotte eberli (kaaren verne), assassins, mysterious scientists & a puzzling coded message & holmes has his work cut out to keep dr. tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight...directed by roy william neill sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen holmes films made between 1939 & 1946 to feature rathbone & bruce as holmes & watson. the script by edward t. lowe jr., scott darling & edmund l. hartmann is based on the short 'the dancing men' by sir arthur conan doyle & isn't the tradition holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story. to neglect what holmes is all about, the solving of complex crimes & mysteries is a big mistake as far as i'm concerned & the involvement of the nazi's & the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place, awkward & just didn't sit too well with me. the dialogue isn't great, professor moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn't come up with a villain for it & as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series. however, at least it's short.director neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack & bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago. it has no real style or imagination & lacks both atmosphere & intrigue as well.technically the film is ok if unspectacular, the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer colourised version is also available. the acting is alright, bruce & hoey do their usual comic relief turns & rathbone's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous & i'm glad he changed it for later instalments.sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series, there is very little by which i can recommend it & everything that made the other's so good seems to be missing here. leave this one till last & watch some of the better ones first, for die hard fans only.

abysmal indonesian action film from legendary arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like 'china o'brien' and 'do or die' with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat o'brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair-styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet. this guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as "tom selick." powerful. at least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. one poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as, "i would rather trust a rattlesnake!" are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10

anyone who will pay to see troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they are going to get. having said that, i didn't think it was possible to make a movie this bad, and still be compelling. i found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end. first off, it's an indonesian action movie with an american main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of "taxi"'s christopher lloyd and rambo. he puts posters of himself dressed up like sly's "cobra" all over the place and even has a custom built firing range (with action-posed cutouts of his greatest enemies)in jakarta although he's in the cia and has just arrived days earlier. there is a lot of action involving gun-play(no muzzle-flashes on those m-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles(that bust through walls), karate(where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex(where all the actors are ugly). the main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. it involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a "drug detector device". why would they need it? that is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? makes no sense, but, it is taken seriously. the actors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to "act". best line? "now dance to your grave you dirty whore!" best scene? rambo jumps onto flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie's hand, let's go, falls, shoots helicopter as he's falling, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown in water. f**king genius! if you can't appreciate trash, don't watch it. if you can, it's awesome. one last thing, did i mention it was directed by the three punjabi brothers?

on a flight back from london, i watched she's the man; apparently air canada has a crap movie policy. perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. amanda bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town. even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. there are some moments of humor, mostly from comedian david cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon doesn't really inspire emotion, although is is cleverly mixed (with the caveat of mindless plausibility). the ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. i guess if i was a 12-year-old girl, i might have really enjoyed this one.

this movie was different from most of jimmy cangey's films of the 1930s in that it was not done by warner brothers/first national, but was a loan-out to a smaller studio. because it was a "poverty row" studio, the production values are lower than you might be used to seeing with cagney films. plus, the plot is certainly one of the strangest i have seen. instead of him being a gangster, he was a good guy in this one--fighting for the law. this isn't all that unusual because cagney frequently played lawmen--such as an oss leader (the forefather of the cia) of fbi agent. but, to make him an investigator for the bureau of weights and measures was indeed odd--especially since, at times, he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie g-men! all in all, a time passer and that's about it.finally, the videotape i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the poorest i have ever encountered. the sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps.

first off, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. that may make you want to see it, but it is not bad in a good way. it's boring, implausible, poorly shot, ridiculously scripted, and lacking in cool disaster effects.worse, it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun, wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood. everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need. particularly the koreans. the most noble characters choose seppaku -- going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks. "only japanese would think this way," says the prime minister.if this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion, the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this.

i have just finished watching this movie, and for me.... it takes ages to finish because it is so boring.....and the storyline is extremely bad.now... where should i start....o.... the movie is called "sinking of japan" ....yeah yeah... it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad. compare to the movie "the day after tomorrow" i would have rate it at least 8/10.the "sinking of japan" does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes. there isn't much excitement at all...boring... all i can say...one more point... i would recommend this movie to have a better title... maybe something like "the romance of sinking of japan" because this movie does have lots of talkings (waste of time... talk nonsense) & the love story is extremely boring & have been dragging too long...honestly.. i almost get frustrated.overall... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e.g. many people running like hell to avoid death..love story part was extremely not touching enough for me.but hey... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though.... & its has got good songs!

due to rather dubious plate tectonics, japan starts to slip under the sea. initial predictions say it'll take about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year! the government think he's a crackpot, but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out.this big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of hollywood films of the late 90's (i assume, having seen none of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human (well, japanese) spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something like that. i.e. it's as naive in its psychology as it's geology... we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned, and the other half would just panic and be useless.the film does have some very nice special effects, but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent hollywood production would be. it is at least as nationalistic, humourless and lacking in self-awareness as that hollywood film would be though, and probably has even worse acting. it does have the hot evil chick from battle royale as one of the leads... but she's not even slightly evil, and is therefore much less hot.the film is much too long at 132 minutes, and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking. i certainly didn't care in the slightest whether japan sank or not by the half way point, and well before the end i was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should i ever find myself in that situation for real.but, it does have nice special effects, and kou shibasaki is still pretty hot, so i magnanimously give it... 3/10.

this disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by sakyo komatsu. japan is located right alongside the pacific ring of fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a japanese term in itself for tidal wave). naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with hollywood having a field day with films like armageddon, deep impact, and more recently, the day after tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.but i'll have to say this: the sinking of japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look like classics. this disaster movie is a disaster, and a massive one at that. having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.the special effects are gorgeous to look at. from satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. however, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain bores.if you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. there are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a god-like mode. things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. it's akin to godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! a populous nation like japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. there are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. these are characters that you don't give a hoot about.if i may just use the day after tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. and infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.unfortunately for the sinking of japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.

this film has some nice special effects, tearing apart the japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble godzilla. the two leads also put in above-par performances. apart from that, it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick. the incongruities in the pacing are bizarre. at one point we have hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of japan, while osaka is buried under an immense tsunami. yet elsewhere in the country, people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice-cream when another tsunami rolls in... kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance, or even a crease in his cream shirt. other people turn up with burns, ripped clothes and mud-streaks on their faces. the japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant. kusanagi's sacrifice in his final evening with shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days. however, the ill-fated pms musings on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance, hint at a darker paranoia that infects japanese concerns regarding their status in the world.sadly, the final sequence is a rip-off of armaggedon, edited with a cookie-cutter.finally, my own particular bug-bear - the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes. this time around, it is mad(-or-is-he?) scientist toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for japan tobacco. at one point, he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface, in a miniature sub the size of a phone box. gimme a break.

may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news , everything is already happened, a great tsunami looms over a city bay and cut , no more to see, tokay suffers a large earthquake , did anyone see more than the 5 seconds i saw? if you want to make a love story , make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title , do please be kind enough to show me the disaster , pd after watching this movie watch jishin retto or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that did not get a chance to do in this movie. don t take me wrong i love disaster movies and i love the original nihon chimbotsu and jishin retto, i even like the latest poseidon , not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence , new nihon chimbotsu looses the point as many times as pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences, and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything , give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly , i know i must sound like a sadistic freak, however i did go to see love actually when i felt like going to see a romantic film , grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn:t . there is also a tv series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975, i have on dvd and it is much better

what a terrible movie! it represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of french society, where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared. the plot is nonsensical, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting. to say the least, the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired. catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was, even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour. the rest of the usually good cast (vincent lindon, line renaud, jean yanne) seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james ivory's "le divorce", with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores, its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use. having watched "le divorce" you can feel a kind of empathy with the french, regardless of their foibles. "belle-maman" leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.

i rented the matrix revisited with a friend of mine. we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix. it turns out that the matrix revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made. it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix, a movie that the target audience of the matrix revisited has already seen!if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix. there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done. the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" that's about as informative and interesting as an mtv special.

first of all "mexican werewolf in texas" is not a werewolf movie. this title is bullcrap. the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas. i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. and i guess it actually works because that's the reason why i bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. anyway the movie isn't any good. actually it's bloody awful. but i didn't expect anything else when i bought it. it's a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster. if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. but i must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad.this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen. the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. they almost never say a line in a normal way. they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. it's so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. it's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. she's the worst of them all. i have never seen an actor as bad as her (and i've seen pteradactyl). even when her boyfriend dies she can't stop being a bimbo about it. i hate her.some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. the gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. the effects are pretty hilarious really, but that's the way i like it. the chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it's easy to see that it's a guy in suit.overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.

i must say i was disappointed with this film. although it is well acted and directed, the underlying story simply plods along too slowly.granted, in another mood i would have liked it better. i did chuckle a lot, but rarely laughed out loud; and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won. but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day (one neither of us had heard of before) this one paled in comparison.if you see lots of movies, then by all means see this -- it's distinctly better than your average fare. but if you (like me) have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining, save this for later.[rate: 7/10]

if it had not been for christopher guest's hilarious role, i would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. the jokes were flat, the movie choppy and slow paced, certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch, but guest's character kept me laughing so i stuck with it.i do feel there are much better choices out there!

i could not stand the woman who played the mother. i wanted her to shut up. she had a bizarre manner of speaking and the lines she was given to read didn't make it any better. i had no idea why the men of the town were so taken with her to cause all these problems except that in a town populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. even after a terrible tragedy her voice was devoid of human emotion, she seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of her life. she delivered her lines with the same emotion whether she was saying "i love you", "i hate you", "the bank is foreclosing", "my dress is on fire". was this actually filmed in ireland? the sun blazed throughout the movie and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the harvest. i lived in ireland during the summer of 2002, the wettest summer in a century. most everything was still harvested. if the farmers in ireland could only harvest during long dry stretches then the country would have starved hundreds of years ago. it seems as if there wasn't a lot of money to make the movie. the black and white flashbacks looked as if they were filmed with the security cameras one can get at sam's club.

like the previous commentator on this film, i too found myself in tears at times during this movie. sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe-inspiring awfulness comes into existence. from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses (what irish emigrant hasn't had that one), its clear we are in trouble. and it doesn't get much better.whisked back to 1950s ireland, we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation, and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war. schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war. the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances. remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war. the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget...the civil war. every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war.the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland. the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic: house prices. if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into ireland's obsession with its past, it fails miserably. it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies. however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche.for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland: it doesn't. 1950s ireland was a horrible, poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves. however there was more than one topic of conversation.

where should i begin with this movie. all i know is that it is a mess. be the script, story, or the actors. first of all, this movie is very disappointing from salman khan who gave us a fun dulhan hum le jayenge and har dil jo pyar karega before this. second rani is getting really annoying, appearing in every stupid movie since kuch kuch hota hai (glad saathiya stopped this nonsense). the story is stolen from the wedding singer, but ruins the funny movie. the dialogues are lacking. i may have laughed here and there, but entertained? no!!! salman khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies, but here he is insane. his character is poorly written. one minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor. rani mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasn't putting any effort. she luckily redeemed her career with saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time. pooja batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough. jackie shroff is wasted. kashmira shah's beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script. raveena tandon looks beautiful, but puts little performance. mohnish behl gets the award for worst (supporting) actor (they need razzie's because there have been terrible movies in india). he says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks weird, and is not in his regular form. just to tell you, there is more to the cast who are also terrible. if it weren't for raveena's awesome beauty in aa meri life bana de, i wouldn't give the movie a point. otherwise the dancing by salman was terrible. pooja batra was dancing like a wind in savariya, otherwise i wish the costumes were given a make-over and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dancing) had been blown away from the wind. the good song of the album was o priya o priya which doesn't have a good enough picturization. same goes for the half way decent title song. otherwise this movie (and the rest of the songs) are a no-no for everyone.

k murli mohan rao made the much better bandhan in 1998 this film is an awful remake of the wedding singerbasically in short, the film consists of: salman khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenesjackie shroff- wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid he is shown as a lover of pooja bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer?inder kumar- confusing characterization againrani mukherjee- boring, overweight and does nothing special pooja bhatra- tall, fair and actress worthy but lacks talentkashmira shah- says a dial as if a poetrymohinish behl- poor fellow the 2 kids were awful toothe story is the same and has awful comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of shakti kapoordirection is poor music is decentsalman khan just goes through the motions, jackie is bad, rani is as usual, pooja is bad, mohinish and kashmira are nothing great inder is awful

when i read the reviews of kahin pyaar na ho jaaye, i thought, "huh?". it was that confusing. to be sure, i went to watch the film and what do you know? it's a remake of "the wedding singer". several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of indianness, but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 hollywood hit. bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it. i groaned so much watching this and i realized i wasn't the only one doing so! one guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! salman khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. he shrieks and whines too much. why can't he just take it easy? he doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by adam sandler. he doesn't have sandler's sense of comic timing. rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she's no drew barrymore either. the scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname ("hi, i'm mrs pugalia") doesn't match up to barrymore's version ("hi, i'm mrs julia gulia"). i felt embarrassed watching that scene, even though i had loved the original. the music is not too bad. it's probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film! avoid this at all cost!

there are no - no redeeming qualities to this film. they didn't check a single fact - not one about... anything. i feel sorry for larry miller, and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venue.the adults are all idiotic. the effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality. the music is honestly cheesy. the plot is beyond belief.i you want to see something good with your family, see anything else. take some time and check for mildew in your attic. my ten-year-old is mocking this film as we watch it. he's unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching.

you know, i always fancy disturbing or strange movies, especially when they get shown at the fantasy film festival in hamburg, germany. but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst film i saw this year. will this comment contain any spoilers?no, because i just did not understand this movie. but well, what can you expect from a flick that was introduced to a festival crowd "we (the guys from the festival) know that not all of you will watch this one until the very end"...i like splatter movies and i also like movies with a strong graphical language. but this? there are a lot of bloody scenes in this one, but why? what is the director trying to tell us? is he saying that we lost all morality and all religious feelings? or is he saying that incest will always end in a disaster? who knows - i do not.if you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for quite some time - watch it. but don¬¥t expect to think "wow, i got the message" - i did not get it...

didn't the writer for this movie see the other three? i loved the original, i thought 2 was the best, i tolerated 3 (it was ok, nothing special). but i hated this one. who dare they kill off ug? this was certainly not the ug who had been almost like a brother to charlie in number 2. remember his speech? charlie said, "you wouldn't just leave me on earth, would you". ug replied, "charlie, bounty hunter", saying that he was now one of them now. how dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a baddie who get's killed by charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they realized the movie was getting boring. in fact for the first 20 minutes, we get a new cast and have to wait this long until we again find out what happened to charlie, who was the hero we've been waiting to see. i kept waiting saying, "come on, when's charlie going to appear?" angela basset must be doing her best to deny she was ever in this turkey. moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. i think the writers decided, that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted. this movie is totally out of line with the first two. and it didn't even seem like it was written by the same people who made 3. 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and mean-spirited (eric dare) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. i hated this movie. hated, hated, hated it. i hated the fact that anyone could like it and i hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. i give this a one start simply because imdb.com won't let me give it a zero.

trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this film falls down in two of these. it does indeed take place in space - but it is neither funny or scary. the plot is dismal and the one joke, concerning the computer's intellect, is overplayed to death. saying that paul whitthorne as ethan, angela bassett as fran and brad dourif as al bert make the best of their ham script. the homo-esque relationship between ethan and al bert is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so crude as to be laughable. all in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late night tv, preferably whilst do the ironing.

(small spoilers) i just bought the dvd of this movie yesterday. i saw it with my friends and i couldn't believe what had happened.in the first 3 movies, the critters at least had a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), but not only did the critters barely ever make an appearance, they weren't funny! they never made me laugh. i must admit that the story did start off nicely. after an hour had gone by i remembered that the critters movies were always very short. so i thought to myself, "where the $^%#$ are the critters?!?!" they were barely in this movie! if that didn't make me mad enough, the boy named ethan was sitting on his bed after charlie had "murdered the ship" and he knew that the critters were still on board! in the first movie the brown family was scared out of their minds. but here, ethan didn't even care! it was as if the critters weren't even a threat!now what i'm about to say next may ruin the ending, but i'm going to say it anyways. in the first movie, at the end, they had to face the giant critter for a final battle. in the second one, there was the great ball of critter. in the third movie, the critter with his fave burned did a spindash (from sonic the hedgehog) and was going to attack the little kid. but at the end of the fourth one (which is what made me the angriest) the bald critter charges toward ethan, and ethan kills it as if it were nothing.now something that i really don't understand was what happened to ug. he was one of my favorite characters in the first two. then after 50 years, he's evil. that was very disappointing. not only that, but wasn't he a faceless bounty hunter? why was he still "johnny steele?" plus he seemed to have a different personality. he seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first two.being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters movies, and loved the third one, i give critters 4 a 2/10

this is a disgrace to the name of all of the lovable and laughable critters' saga. why do the writers feel the need to make the movie unbearable to watch by all quality standards. the critters are cute and adorable as ever but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby. they aren't as terrifying, gruesome, some what spine -chilling and funny as they were portrayed in the movies before. i used to love their porcupine shots but now it is hidden as if it was thought to be repetitive and boring. and what is with the killing and not eating. i thought this movie would have been cool but everything was so wrong. why did ug have to be evil and killed by that which is known as charlie. this movie sickens me. disgrace! disgrace! disgraaaaaaace!!!!

critters 4 starts, & i quote 'somewhere in kansas 1992' & a replay of the last few minutes of critters 3 (1991) as the recurring character of charlie mcfadden (don keith opper) is about to shoot the last two remaining critter eggs in the universe which, we are informed, would mean the extinction of the entire critter race which is against some sort of intergalactic zoological law or something like that. charlie's bounty hunter friend ug (terrence mann) is now known as counsellor tetra & is a top ranking official at the intergalactic council & orders charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them into a pod that will land nearby very soon, the pod does indeed land nearby very quickly & charlie does indeed put the eggs into it but he is also caught in the pod which i presume cryogenic-ally freezes him as it's never really explained. critters 4 then informs us that we are 'somewhere in saturn quadrant 2045' where a salvage ship comes across the pod drifting in space (the credits have barely finished & critters 4 is already stealing entire ideas & scenes from aliens (1986)). rick (anders hove) decides to claim the unidentified, to them anyway, pod & try & make a bit of cash out of it. with the help of his crew, ethan (paul whitthorne), fran (angela bassett), al bert (brad dourif) & bernie (eric dere) the pod is successfully recovered. they get in touch with the intergalactic council & counsellor tetra say to go to an abandoned space-station where a trade will be made for the pod & it's contents, tetra also specifically tells rick not to open the pod. so in true horror film tradition rick opens the pod, thaws charlie out & the critter eggs which hatch, kill rick & escape into the space-station...co-produced & directed by rupert harvey i thought critters 4 was a pretty useless film & rounds the critter series of films off with a whimper rather than a bang. the script by joseph lyle & david j. schow is both predictable & clich√©d, the space-station with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a few hours, the protagonists only means of escape being neutralised early on so they are stuck, the race against time to save themselves, the constant bickering & arguing amongst the crew, people splitting up & the loser who turns into a hero & saves the day, yawn. a lot of plot devices seem to come straight from aliens & it rips off star wars (1979) with a tacky waste compactor scene. the characters are no better & you probably won't give a damn about any of them. while the other critter films could be described as comedy horrors part 4 cannot, it appears to be deadly serious throughout. critters 4 is also incredibly slow, uneventful & dull. it's over 30 minutes before the critter eggs hatch & after this brief sequence it's nearly the hour mark before their seen again, why make a critter film & barely feature them? it can't be because of the expensive special effects as they look like glove puppets anyway, oh & how can a mere hours old critter operate an entire space-station & set a course for earth? how do they even know what earth is? why did capatin rick want to open the pod anyway? what is all that stuff about with the female scientist & a rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once? why do the intergalactic council want the critters so badly? why only send four men? why is this perfectly good looking space-station totally deserted again? critters 4 looks cheap throughout with bland, dark unimaginative sets & it even steals footage from android (1983) for it's ships & space scenes, critters 4 was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects & the ones it takes from android look seriously dated. for the most part only two critters are used although some-more start to hatch but it's pretty late in the day when this happens, for most of the film they are barely seen & the effects for them are the worst of the entire series. forget about any blood or gore as the critters only kill two people during the 90 plus minute running time which just wasn't enough to maintain my waining interest. the acting is pretty poor as well with angela bassett's over-the-top melodramatic reaction to seeing a few critter eggs particularly cringe worthy. to look at critters 4 it is as cheap & unspectacular a production as you could hope to (not) see. the ending of critters 4 has the universe finally being saved form the critter menace, lets hope it also saves us & our local video-stores from the menace of a part 5...

i haven't seen this movie in years, the last time i did i was really drunk after 5 pints of tenant's at my local witherspoon's but even then i though it was quite awful. this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies, the first two were quite good, 3 was quite crap but miles better than this. the story takes place 53 years after critter's 3, were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space miner,em,people and taken on board. once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on board the space ship, cue an obvious 'alien' rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell. only good thing is when we are re-introduced to ug(or so we are lead to believe) who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them

sending the critters to space does seem like an entertaining idea, but was there really any need for a third film much less this fourth one? a film with brad dourif can't be all bad, can it? well, maybe in this case. this cheap sci-fi effort stars returning lovable klutz charlie(the reliable don keith opper) who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the critters' species when ugh(terrence mann)tells him that he's about to break some sort of trans-galactic endangered species law. so at ugh's request, charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space pod. unfortunately for charlie, the damn thing takes off for space and he's trapped inside. the smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he awakes 53 years later inside a decrepitspace station as captain rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic malevolence, and greedy to the core is blasting open the space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade. rick, unbeknown-est to him, lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh. you see rick and his crew found the space pod drifting and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it. ugh reports to them(now in a fine, prominent position as counselor)that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the terracor organization. once the crew dock, they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition, but what's worse is the station computer angela. angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time. it takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the elevators and computers. brad dourif is al bert, pretty much the impresario of computer functions(..and is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most level-headed and intelligent). he seems to be a father-figure to ethan(paul witthorne)who just wants to make it to earth to find his father..this story though doesn't necessarily reach it's zenith. bernie(eric dare)is primarily in the film to be a druggie victim for the critters to munch on. in the film, charlie, after one critter enters rick's mouth and eats away at his throat{yuk}, becomes the crew's guide in understanding what they are fighting against. the film has some elements i found rather confusing{or for a better word, ridiculous)..the two critters grow in size quickly, are somehow able to coordinate a ship for earth, not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station. the crew are able to tap into a log from a dr. mccormick{anne ramsay, whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which ethan discovers her access card}which shows signs that terracor was looking into creating a species to exterminate worlds and people. knowing this bothers al bert who wishes to leave angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures. things don't work out that way because well-meaning charlie(thanks in part to al bert's "ancient" colt .45)kills a critter which had got on board, but in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship. so many repairs on in order, but they halt them when ugh and his storm troopers dock at angela and prove they are not what charlie thought they'd be. ugh is a changed man and charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the crites for purposes of a cruel nature(representation of corrupt corporate governmental types?). this betrayal is what changes charlie..he has perhaps grown up a bit(a wee bit)and now understands that some people just change for the worse. charlie and ugh will come to a face-off over those critters..will the crew be able to escape a space station which has set auto-destruct? this film really doesn't exploit the critters as much as the other three films. i believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise. the first film was a hoot..a really entertaining romp. but, by the time this sequel cam around, the critters just wore out their welcome. the cast, however, do give the film a boost. the critters do get to feed a bit, but their plans of global domination is under-developed. their role in the film isn't established to the greatest heights. i said to myself,you have this enormous space station with unfortunates trapped on board.. could you not take this idea and run with it? sadly, they don't.

during my childhood time i have seen the first three "critters" movies and enjoyed 'em.they were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous horror loving kids.i have never seen "critters 4",so i finally decided to check it out.my verdict:forgettable and pretty bad flick with strikingly low body count.the script by joseph lyle and david j. schow is both predictable & clich√©d,the plot rips off "alien" and "star wars" and the sets look bland and murky.the tone of the film appears to be deadly serious throughout making it slow and dull."critters 4" was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects;the ones taken from "android" look seriously dated.4 out of 10.one to avoid.

now this is a real turkey by the overrated director franco, who gave us such classics as "las vampiras/vampyros lesbos". yes, i think that bad films can be great fun. i adore the hilarious howlers of doris wishman, dwain esper and ed wood jr., but this one proved to be too much for me. it is the first film i rated 1. where should i start? the screenplay is idiotic to the utmost. the dialogue is unbelievably bad. the directing seems to be nonexistent. the best music cue (used repeatedly in this film) was taken directly from the movie "der hexer" (1964). and it's boring! poor shirley eaton and george sanders! in one shot sanders reads a popeye comic while his henchman torture a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). the only thing that baffled me was that franco promptly showed female nudity whenever i thought the movie would gain from it - this is real directing skill! still, i'm afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not really worthwhile.

take the secret agent / james bond craze of the sixties, mix in some concepts from sax rohmer's female fu manchu femme fatale and stir in some absurdest twisted revisionism by director franco - you have the man-hating lesbian sumuru, or "the 7 secrets of..." - better known as "the girl from rio" in the usa, recalling "that man from rio," which has nothing to do with this. yes, this does take place in brazil, we must give it that. sumuru, or sumitra as she's also referred to, is like an evil version of "modesty blaise," played here by actress eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in "goldfinger." there are numerous close-up shots of her staring off camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene). she controls an entire army of female warriors, colorfully costumed, and rules a city called femina or something (just outside rio de janeiro?). these concepts, which previously appeared in "the million eyes of sumuru," sound terrific, but, despite some intriguing set design & visuals, it follows the same campy atmosphere of, for example, the very dated "some girls do," which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army. at first glance, the sight of all these armed females, usually lined up in a row, catches one's interest, but, after 15 minutes or so, you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual.the plot follows what seems like a secret agent, a male, arriving in brazil with 10 million dollars. he catches the attention of the local crime lord (sanders, hamming it up as an elderly bond-type villain), who sends dark-suited thugs in bowler hats to accost him. this sets everything up for a 3-way conflict between the agent, the crime lord and the mysterious sumuru (the crime lord wants sumuru's secrets). sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - maybe that's one of the secrets. this sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace; there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening: one shot of an arriving airplane, for example, stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop, as if this had never been captured on film before. there's a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if there's something unusual about it. the fight scenes are very substandard, as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes. to add some production value, there's a scene of the real rio carnival about midway through. i'm guessing there were various budget problems, especially evident in the climactic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action, such as the lack of even real-looking guns - it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired, falling over unconvincingly. there are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted. but, mostly, you'll be rolling your eyes. hero:3 villains:5 femme fatales:5 henchmen:4 fights:3 stunts/chases:3 gadgets:4 auto:4 locations:6 pace:3 overall:4

there are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess shirley eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to. the result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence. despite the choppy plot, the film is not overly bad until its climax, where its amateurishness runs rampant (terrible editing, overuse of stock footage). worth seeing only as a curio. (*1/2)

the clever marketeer is he is, jess franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like mario bava's ultimately sensational "danger: diabolik!". franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, as he could freely insert as much sleaze, kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to. and he partially understood this very well, as "the girl from rio" revolves on a man-hating organization, led by a funky dressed lesbo, that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! unfortunately (for them, at least), the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss, played by george sanders. all the right ingredients are well-presented, yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. the plot is rich on imagination, but seemingly only on paper, as the action is quite tame. the film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. there's a bit of nudity, sure, but too few according to normal franco standards. all the characters are sick in the head, so the least i expected (or hoped for) were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes. franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with, and i must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members. particularly the veteran actor george sanders ("village of the damned", "psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in a franco production. too bad even he can't save "the girl from rio" from being a huge letdown. a legendary euro-smut filmmaker like jess franco could and should have done more with this concept. shame, shame, shame...

nothing i dislike more than a kung-fu movie that plays for laughs. it is the main reason i can't stand jackie chan (or his lookalikes). he was not always a clown, i must add. "my young auntie" is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind. it is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought down to the mud by endless silly antics and childish behavior. unless you are 5-year-old, i really don't understand how anyone could find this kind of film funny. but humor is indeed a very subjective thing. personally, i think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. i did think leading lady kara hui was very good here. but i had such a hard time sitting through this one that i could not enjoy her fine performance. if you don't mind all the silliness, you might enjoy it. i know i didn't.

el padrino :the latin godfather - while this seems to be a straight to dvd/video type movie- my fullframe copy obviously looked cropped- so maybe this flick had a limited theatrical run.and the title character appears to more of a gringo than moi( i am half honduran). pretty typical rise and fall of a drugdealer movie with the a-list of b-list actors- robert wagner(drug lawyer),kathleen quinlan(crusading judge),tiny lister(mob enforcer),gary busey(child rapist),brad dourif(white power jailbird),stacey keach(bereaved governor),joann pacula(bereaved milf), faye dunaway(crusading lawyer) and galo make canote as an uncredited party guest.this movie is pretty lame- i only watched it to kill time before the skins game- the only thing that saved it was jennifer tilly as a crazed latina drug dealing assassin - she was over the top and sexy-skanky that it was fun to watch her scenes.not worth renting or seeking out. d+

a little while ago, i stumbled upon this dvd while browsing netflix, and with such an impressive cast, decided to give it a go.never before have i seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie (scarface) and failing so spectacularly.the main issue seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. in scarface, tony montana was the self-proclaimed "bad guy." his spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasn't sad, it was a great (and the only logical ending) to someone who lived such a life.damian chapa, as director, writer, and lead actor, sees kilo as some sort of hero, or at least a complicated guy. however he doesn't want to do the grunt work of creating a realistic, sympathetic character. he was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood where his father, a gangster himself, showed him his life. for reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned, he decides he wants to be a drug dealer, and actually drives to the bad part of town, approaches two dealers and says, "hey, i'd like to buy some drugs." he drops his father's name, and in apparently no time they are not only rich, the two guys who are supplying him are acting subserviently to him for reasons, again, never explained.chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him. however, since he's dealt large quantities of drugs before, why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time? the most obvious case of chapa wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a white supremacist/rapist played by gary busey. in scarface, tony montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself, it's done, he moves on. but in this case they ham-handedly have to make busey not only a rapist/pedophile but also a white supremacist. a little overkill, don't you think? i won't go into detail in this regard too much more, but their desperate message of "please like me! i'm a complicated gangster!" fails on every level. try as they might, i didn't feel bad, conflicted, or sympathetic when his buddies are killed (following a shootout), his wife is also killed (shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father, and during an attempted escape when he decided it'd be ok to ride right next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife is in the car), and his eventual demise.suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy, his only achievement bringing the term "wooden" to starry new heights. busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role. tiny lister did well. stacy keach is playing his warden from prison break role. robert wagner is coasting for a paycheck. faye dunaway, while a touch dramatic, still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved. brad dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can. and to give the film credit, it does one-up scarface in one way - jennifer tilly now holds the title of "most ridiculous attempt at a hispanic accent." (sorry robert loggia.) in short, this movie had an interesting premise, but a poor story arc, unsympathetic characters, and hit-or-miss performances. i'd advise mr. chapa to ease up on the forced sympathy next time - really, we don't need to like your character, we just need to be interested. better luck next time.

it's amazing that this no talent actor chapa got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal, pathetic, cheesy and overlong film about a low life gangster who looks white but is half mexican, much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this trashy movie are given a script that seems made up by a 16 year old, i'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as dunaway, wagner, keach, tilly and busey who i'm sure are very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a film. i doubt many people have ever heard of chapa and after this terrible movie i'm sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs.

what is the deal with all these ethnic crime groups copying italian mafia related movies ? we all know the godfather as in don vito corleone, now we have this mexican one which is just a strait out copy. i cant see why other ethnic groups have to mimic and imitate italian mobsters, but it sure makes them look silly. they sure seem to be wanabee italians. i would much prefer to see mexicans perform there own ideas and like to see there own culture, and the way they do it, instead of copying ideas from the godfather trilogy. apart from that the movie was disappointing, seeing mexicans acting and trying to be italians is not my thing. after watching this, i'm now going to watch the "real" godfather so this movie can be erased from my memory.

i'm a sucker for mob/gangland movies, so i rented this movie. this movie is a complete train wreck. with all the big name actors in this film, i can not believe how bad it was. it was so bad, that i began laughing hysterically towards the end of the film. the actor better known as zues or the big dude from the ice cube movie "friday" does an incredible overacting job throughout the film. first thing i told blockbuster when i returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves. do not rent this movie, unless you want to waste two hours of your life. if they come out with a sequel, i wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. i will be more cautious when renting so called 'mob/gangland' movies.

some weeks ago, at a movie theater, i saw a movie poster of el padrino (2004) with the tag "the latin godfather". how lame have we become, i thought, latin just because he is a mexican? let me remind you that anything latin comes from or is related to latium, italy, so the original guy in the godfather movie is more latin than the mexican godfather and this is why: we are called latin-american people because we speak spanish, a language based in the latin language that originated in rome now italy. so to place a tag in a movie poster like "the latin godfather", is not just ignorant, of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic. now about the movie, i just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 i guess is 3 the most.

a friend of mine decided to rent this thing, lucky it wasn't my money.. pretty much wasted my time though. a story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing/directing. maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over-acting :)(gary busey's character for example) all the over-acted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention (for all the wrong reasons obviously) where the movie in itself failed miserably. in short: a waste of time and money2/10

a great gangster flick, with brilliant performances by well-known actors with great action scenes? well, not this one.it's rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well-known actors, that have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie, without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in.first of all, the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fancy in it. the way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is (when i thought the two hours should be almost over, i was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed).the action scenes look a lot like those from 80ies tv series - the a-team, for example. it's just that in the 80ies (esp. with the a-team) those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in "el padrino". it's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something (not to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through).the acting fits quite nicely to the action. either you get the same reaction to everything that happens (dolph lundgren style), or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody (but unfortunately it's not).my advise is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.

well, i'm a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley. i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday. we sat down to watch it and it was so boring. i don't remember laughing once. it's only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end. elizabeth is great in this though. maybe it's just because i'm a big elizabeth berkley fan though. if she wasn't in it i wouldn't have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up. unfortunately even elizabeth couldn't save this film. just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life. it's a very forgetful film.

this movie might be o.k. if not for all the language in it. i think that the storyline itself isn't bad, but i would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie. i know that kids will learn all the swear words along the way eventually, that's true, but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the guise of entertainment.i used to quite like robert loggia; he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his, but in the last few years all i have seen him do are roles with a lot of language in them. if we had an award for over-use of the f word, he would have to be a contender. unfortunately, i think he's now lost me as a fan. when i see his name on movies in future, i will be thinking twice about picking up that title.look, i'm no prude. i use language sometimes too, in extreme circumstances, but when we're watching a movie it is for the sake of e n t e r t a i n m e n t, something which we hope will bring us some joy and escapism. i do not want to be reminded of what's happening out on the streets in any big city these days, and it's a hassle to have to wonder whether or not a movie is alright for my family to watch.i like matt modine too, but it's a pity that he has associated himself with a picture which has let his image down like this. he probably did an o.k. job in the movie, but i turned off about 1/4 of the way through after having had my ears assaulted once too often by others in the cast. why can't these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to carry on with this gutter language? once enough actors, (especially the big names), kick up a fuss about it, the writers will stop putting it in the movies!i'm sorry, but i cannot recommend this picture. it's a pity too, because i think it would probably have been alright, if it had been made well enough for decent families to watch! thank god i only wasted $2.00 on it!

what happened to mathew modine's career??? i can still recall when he was considered an a list actor...was it cutthroat island the final nail in the coffin of a once promising career??? wow, this guy must really hate renny harlin's guts...this movie wants badly to be a comedy but fails to deliver any laughs, the characters are caricatures, and badly drawn ones at that ... but still what pains me the most is seeing mr. modine taking up on this kind of roles, next to actors so far away from his caliber, i mean at the time when he was making movies like birdie he could never in his worst nightmares have imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a hick humping a cow that just had her anus stapled shut, and maybe whats even worst;next to elizabeth berkley!!!

despite this being one of john cusack and demi moore's early films, it is one even hardcore fans can miss, unless they absolutely have to complete the collection. i have rare moments, where i can handle better off dead, but this movie is ultimately worse. i am just not a savage steve holland fan, and he did both movies. so if you don't like the cheesy, random comedy and amateur animation, steer clear of this one. fyi even for the demi moore fans: she can't sing and the 80s synthesizers did not save her. there are too many predictable twists and too-easy jokes. i suppose if you want mindless entertainment or something you can leave on in the background and ignore while you do something productive, then go for it. otherwise, don't watch this movie. if john cusack (or demi moore) couldn't save it, you know it's got to be bad. they are the only reason i didn't give this movie a 1.

savage steve holland wrote and directed his second film, one crazy summer, with john cusack and curtis armstrong again in a supporting role. cusack and bobcat goldthwait are recent graduates headed to cape cod in order to stay at goldthwait's grandmother's for the summer. along the way, they bump into demi moore being pursued by john matuszak and a motorcycle gang. soon the three are united in trying to save a house from being turned into another lobster restaurant by a conniving, spoiled family that considers "work" a dirty word. the film contains several funny vignettes like the millionaire dollar radio contest gags and the godzilla skit.like holland's first film, better off dead, john cusack adds immeasurably to the film. otherwise, this is a dud of a film filled with contrived situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to quirky). moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with some horrible synthesizers. goldthwait's gags wear thin after awhile, and armstrong never was an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except grade z stuff. the tow truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious instead of the endearing underdogs they're obviously meant to be. this is more of a hit or miss, kitchen sink comedy which could have used a better script and direction. *1/2 of 4 stars.

this is beyond stupid. two high school graduates travel to nantucket for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting.demi moore co-stars in this one. as the film was in 1986, was ashton kutcher just a babe in the woods at that time?moore's grandfather has died and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring a new meaning to the term mean.bobcat goldthwait, with that obnoxious voice is in the film, as well as two brothers, who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent.the writing is absolutely ridiculous. highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other: "did you ever notice that when people die, they go alphabetically in the papers?" i rest my case.

i hated the book. a guy meets a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and all the while they're being chased by a hit-man and a ape beast thing (both of whom want the dog). dean koontz really can't write (i read the book at my sister's recommendation, i should have known better). when i saw this, (mostly out of a morbid curiosity) i actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book, even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of. i figured at least if they're going to make a film adaptation of the worst book i've ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate. they turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason that bothered me most of all (even though i seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldn't have made it any better). quite simply; bad book, bad movie, don't see it.

okay, my question; who's the idiot that wrote this movie, giving it the same name as dean koontz's awesome book? its terrible, nothing like the book...you got the dog, and the watcher, but there the similarities end...might be good, if you haven't read the book, though...but it disappointed me, really.they should make a new one, and let koontz write it... now that would be a good movie... i'll say it again, this movie disgusted me...absolutely disgusted me. it was terrible, it was absolutely nothing like the book. i would never again watch it.

i couldn't agree more. the book is one of dean koontz's best novels and this film is a total travesty. i watched about half of it then threw the tape in the bin in disgust! i have no idea what the idiotic director was thinking making this piece of crap but i would rather poke my eyes out with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again! everything about this film is just wrong. first the main character is changed from an ex marine to a high school kid. why??? second the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! hem i bet freud would have something to say about that! lol. the dog is cute enough and the best thing in the movie and completely outcast everyone else! also a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie. there really is nothing good to say about the film except that at least it's relatively short at an hour and a half or so. if anyone hasn't seen the film yet do yourselves a favour! read the book! it is so much better than this worthless waste of time!

jack frost 2 was a horrible, terrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie. the original, was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. and the snowman went around murdering people, and avoiding blow dryers like the plague. this, however, was a far cry from the quality of the original. it seems like this even had a lower-budget because for some reason, after an hour into this film, i still hadn't seen the snowman. some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice-over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character. disappointing to no belief, even for a fan of bad cinema.

-may contain spoilers-clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. i just can't see it any other way. what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.anyhow, where to begin. the bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than george w. bush's college career. i don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack frosts' were getting killed. also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. "how do we know it's him?" like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! a great camp film, but a very bad film overall.

this movie sucks. did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms. there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else. this movie blows hard, painful to sit through too. stay far away.

yes, in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make. it has its funny moments, but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me. you can not come up with a good story, your effects are going to really be bad, hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie. the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort. it also had better effects too, this one is just a step or two ahead of "hobgoblins" as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets. still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost. actually, i am just kidding, but really it was the funniest part of the movie.

ill-conceived sequel(..the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules(..it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept).i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists, but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting. anyway, the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival(..i mean seriously, why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).the "snow anvil" murder scene takes the cake. ice icicles protrude from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them. oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie..such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone("oh, it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!")or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. jack frost has the power to freeze water(..then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow. one sequence has jack freezing pool water, encasing a swimming model under the sheet, result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.oh, there's also a recreation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit from the christmas story("cowatonga dude!").i gotta hand it to the cast, though..they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining. christopher allport(..perhaps unwisely)returns as sam, to face his old nemesis, as does eileen seeley, as his wife. the attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor(..for me, at least) fell flat, but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the introduced foreign elements, allow him to withstand coolant/anti-freeze, and, even worse, he now can reproduce..through indigestion, jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans, but i personally found this junk rather hokey(..that's the purpose behind it, i suppose, cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable.the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort. the weapon against them..bananas! it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film, both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze(..an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed, and i guess in their being "being linked" by the icicle, jack inherited sam's banana allergy, or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both "merged" in a sense.phew, such a film as this defies simple explanation. it's a film with effects and plot so terrible, one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings.

having already seen the original "jack frost", i never thought that "jack frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. boy was i wrong! then again, a-pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. i believe this is the first a-pix sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more a-pix sequels.it's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. they are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which i have to say looks very cheesy. the computer animation surprised me, as the first "jack frost" had no such effects.i'd strongly recommend that you see the original "jack frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).now only if there was "uncle sam 2"...

the poet carne disappears (didn¬¥t he disappeared with pr√©vert?) and is followed by the judge carne. the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesn¬¥t understand and he doesn¬¥t want to. it¬¥s a long way from the wonderful "les enfants du paradis"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this episode had potential. the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. and when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.first of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. "it's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;" "this door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago;" "the door opened by itself, without me touching it;" etc.). given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn't she take some precaution before entering it? maybe she could investigate in the day time. or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. or maybe she could turn on the lights!!! also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. just unplug the phone! the phone company doesn't need to be involved. walk up to the phone and unplug it. case closed.finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical. if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony. brave little toaster anyone?

although i could sum this pathetic episode of night gallery in two words, those two words being "horse manure," i am obligated to write a minimum of ten lines. this is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of rod serling, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy. the premise of giant rodents inhabiting the moon, a lifeless orb to be sure, is totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. i suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. i can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes first aired on that date. all in all, a waste of film, actors and air time.

this "space snippet" was kind of dumb. i guess it was supposed to be a shocker unexpected ending, but imho it was just a huge letdown. joseph campanella and the rest of the earthbound actors do a great job in this one; their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though. how this ending could ever have made it through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me. the other comment on here is not correct, the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season, this thing was supposed to be taken seriously! the producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice.

okay, so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct mm2 and mm3, i thought, heck, i got to check out monster man and see what its like, maybe i can get a part in it, but when i popped it into my dvd player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad i mean horribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass thinking he's funny, not to mention how looooong the director spent on the pointless desert road trip, i cam to the conclusion that these guys didn't have a clue of what they were doing and missed the boat by a long shot. the story had potential to be somewhat different than the usual bs you see on the blockbuster/hollywood video shelf put out by lions gate these days, but they surely messed this one up. why put so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad acting and bad jokes, why not shorten the road trip and put more of the plot in the movie. myabe the writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore, that they had to find filler to make the usual 84 minutes???? all in all, and i'm being easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that gets his skull crushed when chasing the three leads out into the street, i will give it at least 1 star for trying, and the gore/kill scenes weren't that bad, again, they tried. too bad, lions gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea, but failed. i don't recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene. crap!

what an absolute joke of a movie. the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets jeepers creepers meets texas chainsaw massacre. three good films in their own right and you would think, using their blueprint, mm couldn't go far wrong. well that's what i thought, and i was very, very mistaken! we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding. they pick up a girl (no she doesn't get her clothes off), then they get chased by a leatherface rip-off in a monster truck, whom they aptly name f**kface (aka monster man).the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle, but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin it's potential.so mm decides he's got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit, they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with hitch-hiker sarah (though they both wear underwear!). then they are caught by mm, taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill mm, but fail, hence the set-up for the sequel. apart from a minor 'twist', that's it.if you can get past the first 2 minutes ¬ñ where adam's friend harley pops up from hiding in the back of adam's car to try to scare him, with no explanation as to how harley even got there, how long ago or how adam even failed to realise ¬ñ without thinking you hate it already, then you may just enjoy this film.monster man has very poor cinematography and direction which is immediately off-putting. this is the kind of movie that you'll be able to pick up as one of those films in a box set of 20 horror movies that you've never heard of.what is so irritating is blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality films that are shot on digital by some amateur film students, and that's exactly what mm is (though imdb states this particular director was born in 1961).the acting throughout this film is atrocious. the script, which the writer obviously considered to be funny, is irritating and childish. you get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting. in fact, the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised, full of those boring, un-entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved. imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation, sure, points are funny ¬ñ to you, but mostly it's trash. that's what the script for mm is like.don't watch it for the gore either ¬ñ it's fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there (bad taste, evil dead et al¬Ö) jeepers creepers 1 & 2, even with their cheesiness and plot holes, are far superior to this film. compare the intro of jeepers creepers to the intro of monster man and you'll see what i mean.

now don't get me wrong i love bad movies... no i adore bad movies, troll 2.... ouch painful, manos the hands of fate... just watch torgo go, guru the mad monk.. is that traffic noise in the medieval background? ok so that's clear, but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better, but didn't make it. why not? well it would be easy to blame the plot, but heh we've seen worse, there weren't too many holes and heh i know there's not a lot of originality in it but then that needn't kill a film. the effects aren't bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is ok, the truck quite menacing so where did it go wrong? well i'd love to blame it on the 'chris moyles' look-a-like harley... so i will! comedy and horror are difficult to mix well, bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem. i loathed this guy from the moment he stuck his head up (literally), the continual bating of the overly meek adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose belief that the mildest of people wouldn't react by pushing him out of the moving car door... and i thought it was the monster bits that the director was meant to have trouble convincing us of. why are bad movies fun? well you have great fun poking holes in them, laughing at the script, all the howlers etc. this film doesn't make the coveted category of 'worst movies' because its just bad due to being annoying nuff said. don't bother, go watch anything else and you'll be a better person for it... i promise! (fade to chants of torgo torgo torgo)

wow, where do i begin? after suffering through this wretched $1.00 rental (thanks a lot, family video) i just had to make a few comments. i did not bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film, but hopefully you will know who i am talking about.a monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two college-aged buddies to their doom. they encounter a hot girl wearing slutty clothes. i mean, this just sounds fantastic in theory. i was laughing hysterically at the dvd box while i walked it up to the girl behind the counter at the video store.acting: the hot girl, played by aimee whatever, is visibly laughing through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared. the other two major actors in the film, the fat prankster and the vanilla straight-guy are both terrible. the fat guy thinks he's jack black. he's not. the other actor, our hero, over-emotes and misses all his cues and comes across as some generic character you might see in a made-for-nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90's. look: i don't expect great performances in movies like these, but at least the actors can make an effort to not be annoying. you can be an incompetent actor but still be agreeable (i.e. john wayne). at least that aimee gal is attractive.script: holy ****, who thought this dialogue was funny? i wouldn't have the nerve to play this out in front of my grade school drama class, much less pitch it as a film script. unfathomably bad. more on this later.production: ok, this is the one place where the film definitely succeeds. production quality is amazingly high. the look of the film is very good. apparently the only talented person who worked on the movie was the director of photography.ok, here are my biggest gripes: 1) the guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles an hour.2) the guy driving the car is well out into the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat. he is supposedly meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition but he does not notice a 300lb jack black impersonator in the back? come on.4) characters never change their clothes. there are two hotel scenes. presumably, showers are available to our characters yet over the 3 days this movie takes place, none of the characters bothers to change their clothes.5) comedy. lighthearted, slapstick comedy does not mix with horror. period. you can't have our characters running away from a monster truck one second and the next second have them verbally jousting one another with some dopey light/comedy music playing. this kind of pacing virtually ruins any tension in the movie. movies like evil dead 2 which mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be loosened yet never completely eliminated with humor. monster man doesn't get it.i'm irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot more clever than he really was. oh well.

heard some good remarks about this film as being very gory and frightning, but it's neither. obviously the screenwriter wanted to do a scary horror film but at the same time inject some teenage comedy for the young target audience. scares and comedy seldomly result in good films, the same goes for monster man.not really funny, nor scary or overly enjoyable on any other level.aproaching 39 years of age i've seen my share of horror movies. i have seen good ones and terrible ones, but the crop of films released these days are so frighteningly mediocre it bores me to watch 'em. the acceptance these days for bad films like this is what really annoys me. let's face it, they produced a lot of crap in the 70's, 80's and 90's but they were regarded as such then as well. today they're regarded as "good entertainment". - bollocks!

last night, i am sitting in my tv room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the tv tray & i decide to put the movie "monster man" into my trusty vcr. expecting a fun-filled, gory, crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. what do i get instead? one of the most silly, stupid, unfrightening & predictable films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. and what's even worse, all during the(& i use this next phrase loosely) "sex scene" the girl keeps all her clothes on! i'll make this summary short & sweet: mix "dude where's my car" (about a good 1/2 of the film) with a very watered down "hitcher", add a redneck version of the antagonist from "i madman" as the primary villain & finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo & you'll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is. it's also utterly predictable throughout. the only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a "horror film" is that some of the moments between the 2 guys (even though the "hero" is one major annoying geek & the other is a jack black clone) are kind of funny (just mediocre funny i.e..like most of snl skits). other than that, "monster man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (this one i'll be handing out at halloween time-just hope after the person views it i don't get my house egged or worse)

i would like to know who conned the producers of this movie to pay for its production - that persion is a genius of sorts. this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast. i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on, but nothing really was. it was not scary. the dialog was poorly written. the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episode.at this point i'm just mad that i wasted all that time. that's a couple hours that i will never get back.i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening. take a nap or hit the gym instead. or if you want to be scared, turn on a cable news channel.

i completely disagree with the previous reviewer: this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot. (unless you really think sipping from a septic tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot) in fact, the only reasons i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a.) two of the actors are decent b.)the soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in for contrast and c.)the monster truck is pretty terrifying.other than that, this is a movie with some intermittent, creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by unrelenting crassness, crudity and vileness. the former best friend character is one of the most annoying i've ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at all.a waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the hitchhiking character...

fans of horror comedy will like this one. others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off. it's sort of a buddy film, with over-the-top violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters, and a lot of craziness.it looks to have been made on a budget of about $100, by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party. there's a lead who's a frustrated nerd, and his loudmouth prank-pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second. there's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the film. whenever this thing and its gnarly-mask wearing driver appear, it's a great scene. there's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat, and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars. the nerd's friend never shuts his yap, and gets them in one mess after another. their arguing got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film make up for it.sight gags poking fun at several "psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody" films are everywhere. take your pick which one is riffed the most: hills have eyes, saw, and jeepers creepers were some that i recognized.it's enjoyable insanity, if you're in the right frame of mind. sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun; it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together.

some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour, but when a film comes along that isn't as original as the "classics" but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po-faced, wanna-be critics completely slag it off. this film made me laugh aloud several times, this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows. the two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film. you root for them the whole way and laugh along with them, everyone has friends like both of these guys. another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's awesome, intimidating and really well shot. taking inspiration (completely stealing) from loads of films, the most obvious being duel, jeepers creepers and probably in reference to the jack black alike co-star orange county. but really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here. but so what, it's not trying to win any oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score it's a 10! obviously it's not getting a 10, i give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99% of the people on imdb. there is no-way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ain't getting a 10 either. it's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares. you really can't get anymore simple than that.

this dvd is barely 30 minutes long, and has dull interviews that reveal that the average slipknotian has an iq of around 30. but these aspects are the least problematic here.the real trouble is that slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100,000 units of their crap. (the only reason i say "one of the" instead of "the" is because system of a down are even worse.) much like ed gein's girlfriends, this band's music is pieced together from age-old metal clich√©s, which are to be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. in fact, their image is kind of fun; their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment.their music, however, consists of nothing of quality - whatsoever: just a bunch of gimmicky, heard-them-a-million-times-before played-solely-at-the-guitar-neck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form "songs" that have no cohesion, no highlights, no nothing. but if the riffs are truly bad, then the vocals are even worse: slipknot's singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting "evil" growl - the kind 90% of all metal bands today have - but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing! still, what could one expect? rule no.39 of the "nu metal" handbook says quite clearly: "you will alternately growl and sing. ignore the fact that the two styles don't mix well, because most of your fans are so tone-deaf they will love you even if you **** into the microphone." slipknot are at their absolute worst when their "singer" starts belching out "melodies".but back to their image. it's stolen, copied, ripped off, nicked, borrowed, taken without asking from none other than mr.bungle. you've never heard of them? of course you haven't. you only listen to nu-metal, and mr.bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. they too wore masks - grotesque, horror ones, similar to those of slipknot, i might add - in the late 80s and early 90s. this band, whose frontman is mike patton from faith no more, never hit it big because their music wasn't directed toward the average music fans (to put it mildly).so, basically slipknot aren't even original in the image department. they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring to the legions of their zit-faced fans, which is when slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music.speaking of mike patton, it's interesting that a number of nu-metal bands often site his singing as a major influence. predictably - and thankfully - patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub-genres ever...having said that, enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye... and then polish those slipknot posters, because in a few years no-one will be taking care of them, the poor dears.having seen corey in the documentary "get thrashed", i finally understand why he wears a mask: he is a blue-eyed baby-faced ginger, looking like dave mustaine's younger brother! not exactly scary.for more of my music-world rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/fedor8/1please punish me hard, very hard, by clicking "no" below. that'll teach me...

here's why this movie fell very short of its potential(i don't read much, so i don't care what the novel was like). 1. i think brendan frasier copied his encino man from lambert's tarzan. it was stiff, and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. they screwed with the story. maybe that's how the book goes, but for as long as i can remember the first utterances of tarzan were "me tarzan, you jane". jane is the first human tarzan encounters. i did like the natives a bit more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. tarzan is primarily a love story. i'm sorry, but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture. that qualifies her for a supporting role at best. supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other, not enough screen time, sorry. not only was andie mcdowell's vioce over pathetic(most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked) the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a whopping 0. i never believed they loved each other, which made the belgian dudes closing voice over, quite frankly, silly. when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an urge, if you will, a feeling he's never felt before. jane brings out the humanity in him, and he brings out the untamed side of her. its this chemistry that compells the story of tarzan. not that lord greystoke's dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him. even a good face lift couldn't help this movie. it needs massive internal reconstruction. oh, and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place. final judgement, 4 out of 10. sorry tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see real acting, drop lambert and check out leonardo dicaprio.

a female friend invited me to see this in the theaters.after half an hour we walked out, and went into the next multiplex (yeah, we broke the rules) in time to catch the beginning of against all odds.i remember too many apes dancing around saying, "oog, oog." very little about the characters or introduction to the story captured either one of us or was even memorable. it just dragged to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend).the production values were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. it seemed like ralph richardson and andie mcdowell were going to be wasted in such a poorly written film.perhaps if you make into the second hour, there is something worth seeing. i do not have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.

i am very interested in animal children and i have read many edger rice burroughs novels -- but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested, nor could i stomach all the absurd, unrealistic scenes. i only managed to sit through the africa part and john's first few days in scotland. let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright silly'! the actors in ape suits looked like extra large chimps, rather than great apes (there is a difference). they did not move with the grace that a wild animal would. (for comparison, see some of the better planet of the apes movies where they trained their actors to move in simian fashion). the apes eat large haunches of meat -- not a common ape practice as far as i know. i am a sucker for animal stories but the script did not make me care about the apes. the great white hunters of the expedition that finds john clayton are charicaturish entirely. the parents of clayton were shipwrecked on an ocean beach, but somehow it is a very long trip down the river to get to the coast -- give me a break! let's talk about 'slow'. even the folks who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie. far from it. it tries to be a character study -- unfortunately the downright silly part predominates! i did not read burroughs' tarzan books, but many of his other series -- they were packed with meaningful action and heroic purpose! this film just isn't there.

this is my opinion of this movie, expressed in its dialogs.to be more serious, i can't say this movie is a bad moment but i didn't enjoy it either. first, i was simply indifferent & couldn't get my mind into the apes world. even though the make-up are very realistic, the constant screaming was irritating. may the film have changed apes for cats and it's a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter.the second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of then newcomers (macdowell & lambert), but i felt alienated: all the story is located in a big british mansion: no matter how luxurious is it, it was like a prison for me.at last, it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs' story of tarzan ? i don't know, having never read the book (or seen the disney): .in conclusion, i don't have any good moments to remember, so one viewing would be enough for me. i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called "overture" at the beginning... what's the meaning? only the director knows it.

i've read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book.. i don't think any of them have actually read it. edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters. we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view. i've never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgar's vision. maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story. so, if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals, maybe a good cry, see the movie. i hope john carter of mars get's more respect than tarzan has. we miss ya, edgar!

the incomparable paul naschy, horror film icon of spain, lends his talents to this entertaining if not scattershot film. what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story. all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride.paul naschy plays a cold-hearted hit-man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters (one of which is his flame who is carrying his child) to swipe a cache of diamonds from a belgian businessman. when the deed is done, the allure of the diamonds is too tempting for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese cohorts. his girlfriend, whose brother paul killed, vows revenge and chases paul through the forest, shooting him up and leaving him for dead. however, paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recuperate.at the estate, the two daughters, silvia aguilar and azucena hernandez, fight for paul in his weakened state, with the busty silvia aguilar determined not to lose out to the sweet and prim azucena. but things get hairy for mr. naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter's long dead mother on the estate grounds. couple this with the japanese lass looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides.story: $$ (the story goes a number of ways and doesn't fully satisfy. the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but silvia, whose character seems assertive and volatile, simply lets azucena win in the paul naschy sweepstakes without putting up a fight. personally, i would have preferred the ghostly apparition story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman)violence: $$$ (you get gunplay, a blown-up babe and pigs eating some poor schmuck alive. gore hounds will not be letdown with this naschy flick).acting: $$$ (paul naschy, as always, is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds. starring with him again are the luscious silvia aguilar and the beautiful azucena hernandez, who teamed with mr. naschy in the little gem "the craving." both girls do a fine job).nudity: $$$ (you get very brief glimpses of both aguilar and hernandez but they are strategically placed, keeping the naught bits covered. full nudity is supplied by the two lesser appealing actresses: the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for silvia and azucena).

this is just a long advertisement for the movie "the death tunnel". although it is an interesting history of the waverly hills sanatorium, the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation. more "ghost orbs" which you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera, and the "ectoplasmic mist" is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash. i couldn't see any "shadow people" until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image. no scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena, only paranormal. perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe, so be sure to make plans to visit the sanatorium on your next vacation in louisville, kentucky.

i think it's two years ago since i have seen the movie and till this day it's the worst film i have ever seen. the only thing i thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some tax reason. so after all this time i finally spilled my gut ;) and now imdb says i have to fill 10 lines with comments:"sorry, you must provide at least 10 lines in your comment. please return to the edit window (or use the back option if this isn't a new window)."please there is nothing to say anymore...sorry for some bad english.

i admit it now. this is one of the lamest films ever made. but, in mr sjogrens defense, the "not really"-scene wasn't all bad! and you gotta love the effort of going all the way to sweden just to find a sweet swedish 15 year old blonde, have her speak swedish posing as the jewish mother of henry (dennis hopper). what makes this scene so perfect is that henrys father answers the blonde swedish-speaking(jewish?) girl in german... the best actor/actress of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of henrys mother, this is a woman who has had no experience whatsoever of acting, but still puts in the most convincing performance of all!all and all, this flick is nostalgia for me personally, it is after all what gave me a posting on imdb:s database. :d//feelin like a movie-star*

the worst movie i've ever seen. i still don't understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in. maybe they had bills to pay... the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife. that's the beginning of a typical serial killer life! it seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80's but then appears a new beattle... amazing! this movie was directed in 2001... i'm quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie. i heard that dennis hopper's wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat. pathetic!

this pointless film was a complete disappointment. none of the characters is likeable in the least, so you watch what befalls each without really caring. what was worst was renting this movie at a gay owned establishment only to find that this story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men engaged in plenty of scenes of straight sex and not one single scene of gay sex.

i watched this last night on sundance. altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever. this show, despite its "star power" is utterly non-compelling, and its political insights--which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with--are shallow and clunky, and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today, despite the fact it's coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario cuomo. the drama, as such, is not very dramatic, and the comedy is not funny. the only points of interest, really, are seeing how new yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of a cast and crew to reassemble a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988. sometimes it seems like altman's sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once, the effect of which is one feels depressingly like they're a stranger at a wedding.

i like to think that i can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary, and i certainly love a good movie that makes me think.if you like out of the ordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. this movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you will be thinking after it is over is how it is possible you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this.a movie of this kind needs a driver to get buy in from the viewer. why are we interested in the main characters? what motivates these characters through their existence? why do they make the decisions they make? this movie makes a very weak attempt at doing these and fails in the process. there is no chemistry between these two actors, both of who are superb in their ability to be comfortable in any role. so why did they fail here? i strongly feel that they didn't know what their motivations were either, and when an actor doesn't know, their audience can't follow.in sum, i have seen macromedia flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thought, at least i have more interest in the morphed hamster who likes the moon than why this married family man would risk it all for a "code 46" violation.

there is nothing worse than science fiction crafted by folks who don't have a feel for it. grasping at a concept which wouldn't be so terrible by itself (a future where cloning is common enough that it is necessary to make it a crime for you to breed with someone too close to you genetically) the screenwriter proceeded to allow his ill-suited imagination to run wild.when tim robbins' character was able to guess a security guard's computer password simply by getting her to tell him one thing about herself, i knew i was in for trouble. this ability was later revealed to be due to robbins having taken an "empathy virus", viruses being used to grant instant (or nearly instant) skill upgrades to their users. robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus -- a mandarin chinese language virus, which allowed her to speak chinese, but as she complained, "she couldn't understand what she was saying." okay, first off, empathy, no matter how intense, isn't esp. without incorporating some sort of true mind-reading aspect (like an empathy virus which actively releases virions into the vicinity, infects nearby people, picks up bits of their memory, then departs for the original host -- which is, as you can probably tell, a smidgeon on the impractical side) you can't justify being able to determine a specific detail like someone's password just by "listening to the things you didn't say". nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what you're saying -- the virus can't infect your vocal cords and translate for you on the fly, because a virus can't *think*. to give you the power to speak chinese, such a learning virus would have to modify your brain. it would have to encode the knowledge among neurons, and once it's in there, it's *yours* -- you certainly understand what you're saying, because you have to. to use your own brain to perform a task, you must understand that task (for the most part). unless, of course, they movie is suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to put in place some bizarre multiple-personality mental schism where some sub-personae of yours functions as a built-in, one-way translator.the m√©lange of languages spoken by the characters is decent enough, although nowhere near remarkable enough to warrant all the love other reviewers have given. what's more, all the multicultural insertions in the world can't make up for a simple, frustrating fact: the dialog stinks! it's slow, it's plodding, and it's unnatural. again, i'm sure adherents have convinced themselves that the dull strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius creating a truly futuristic (and therefore subjected to linguistic drift) form of speech. i disagree. good dialog is good dialog in any era -- and the same goes for tripe.lastly, i'll revisit the central concept of the movie -- the banning of sex with yourself. widespread cloning is a nice, classic sci-fi topic. so is global warming leading to ecological devastation (which code 46 also incorporates). unfortunately, the two don't go together! if you have an ecological disaster cutting down severely on the available living area, you don't run around cloning people! you have population problems enough as it is -- you don't add to them by cranking out re-issues. regular, old-fashioned sex-and-birth provides all the population you need, and cloning of any sort would be ruthlessly suppressed.to be fair, the movie wasn't all bad. it had some nice cinematography. perhaps if i had watched it muted, i could've enjoyed it.

i thought this film was a poor effort by the british film council - fell flat as hey, come on, tim robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him as well. like lost in translation its really hard to suspend disbelief in this context. it's a good looking film but lacks punch. when tim robbins is pretending to be psychic it looks like he has a small migraine. he looks uncomfortable and life less. the part where he is screening suspect employees at sphinx is laughable. if an investigator came to my factory the last thing i would do is tell him about my freckle fetish. it's obviously over-intellectual. clumsy. the city is as it is, a convenient backdrop. they obviously picked the most futuristic city they could (shanghai) as a backdrop but the city never really comes out and effects the characters as in for example blade runner, where the characters of the city often intersect the story. slow as a wet week. no chemistry, real dramatic high points, so so plot.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers***i saw this movie last night at a screening. i started out already liking tim robbins and loving sci-fi. the first third of the movie was very cool. the score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the film maker's vision of the future was realistic yet starkly interesting nonetheless. i remember thinking to myself: "this is the most intelligently done sci-fi movie i've seen in a while". then they just couldn't keep it together.although from the outset, there were a number of more "rough around the edges" issues with this film (namely the editing, and later some of the writing/plot development), these issues were forgivable. they became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark, and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all. robbins could not breathe life into his character, but did the best he could. his female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role.the main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. they ended up with neither.good:some of the cinematography: grainy, it felt like "21 days later" some times.very fitting for a futuristic movie like this.i dug some of the location shots.the music was cool.the film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting.i liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie.some of the writing was interesting (early on). the girl who played maria gonzales (name?? can't recall), she was good.***spoilers below***a few questions/comments:i felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story. namely viruses. obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically 'afraid' of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him for code 46. then they take him away and erase his memory and the movie ends. classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ending if you ask me. ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right?was robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus?why didn't they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom? that could have made some interesting story.at first i like the salutations from across the globe in everyone's speech. but it became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing. i get it, the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but it started feeling like an at&t global networking commercial by the end of it.if they were 'outside' how could they have gotten busted for code 46?'cover' was never well defined. sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and other times it was as vital as life or death. again, loose definitions allow them to use it for gluing disparate parts of the plot together.okay, i'm starting to get to negative about it, so i'll stop. there were some cool scenes, and interesting things about this movie, but that only gives it a 4/10

we're in a not so distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, languages mixes with each other (although english prevails over the rest), races have merged, human clonation is a fact, and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones: the one for the valid and the one for the non-valid... a brave new world (in aldous huxley's style) in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden (for health reasons ¬ñthat's the code 46 of the title-). in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other.winterbottom had an important story, with quite a big potential. a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm, narrating it in a so weary way, removing any emotions... coldness, that's all code 46 transmits. coldness and boredom. not even the presence of samantha morton and tim robbins (both of'em play their roles wonderfully) , nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie. what a pity.code 46: what could have been and never was.*my rate: 4/10

if you are a weirdo who thinks it's "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, get her pregnant, and then have sex with her again once she's had an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you, then you would like this movie.nevermind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he has no conscience as to what he's doing. he can't do right by his job, his family, or maria. he's a loser. there is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it is vile and incestuous.it moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie. i couldn't even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a 'romance'. i'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie theater on this one. 0/10

i just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films i have ever seen. it was so boring that i found myself zooming through it at x2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes. i was not just disappointed, but angry that i had wasted my money to rent it. it ranks within the top five of the worst films i have ever seen, and i've seen thousands of movies! the plot was very confusing. had i not first read the dvd sleeve cover, prior to renting it, i would have been totally lost throughout this film. i would not have thought that tim robbins, after having made such good films as "shawshank redemption" would have agreed to appear in this film.

the film disappointed me for many reasons: first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well-built but did only feature a marginal role. then, the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation. the middle-eastern setting, man with family meets new girl overseas, karaoke bar, the camera movements and the imagery - all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility. this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film!? the female main actress is awful - did she play the precog in minority report? and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes. r-rated just for this? this movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore!

european films may be slower-paced and less plot driven than american films, but this takes it way too far. it also show a whole bunch of incompletely drawn characters doing inexplicable things. it's not fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just awkward and bad.what's the message here? that people in france are pensive and gaze morosely a lot? that they like to watch other people having sex? they they spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on his neck? do not wear a watch when seeing this film, as you will be astonished at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time.this is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl, though actually he seems troubled before then. he is not merely upset at his own personal tragedies, but apparently mentally quite slow, behaving very much like a learning-disabled six-year old child. he stares blankly a lot, walks with arms rigid like a little kid, speaks in meek, simpering, tones, behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions (though no one seems to notice or care, even when it is supposed to be police business). he's not a troubled cop, more of an outpatient. picture andy kaufman's latka character on taxi, but without the humor. he is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult. that he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing -- unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the weirdos who scripted this thing. the plot is clearly secondary. do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered. this not that important, though the implausibility of their behavior is sort of insulting. the problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either. that leaves the long lingering close-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces etc. the ending struck me as especially ridiculous -- totally unsupported by the events leading up to it -- unless you think, "what's the worst way this film could end?"there is lots of sex and nudity, which is supposed to mean something. you want vaginas? you'll see vaginas. not to worry, it's art. it has deep meaning, what i am not sure. and the protagonist, despite his innocent weirdness, seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or jowl fetish.finally, the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background -- very hard to read many of them. on the other hand, there isn't much dialogue, so this isn't a big problem. there is also very little sound -- not even ambient sounds you would expect to hear -- in the film, contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience. the old woody allen would have had a field day parodying this work.that this is an award-winning film is sad. i would hate to see the losing films.enjoy.

the director infuses this film with false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the film. every single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it needs to be. you could easily cut out 1.5 hours of this agonizingly long 2.5 hour film without eliminating: one word of dialogue, one image, one event, or bit of movement.this was one of the most gratuitous wastes of film i have ever seen. other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an understatement. l'humanite is pseudo-intellectual trash designed to be anti-hollywood so that the cannes judges could assert their independence from the oscars.the imdb reviewer states: "unlike hollywood movies - which usually force the audience into overdrive - this forces the audience to slow down and look at some of life's tiniest and most mundane features in great detail." you would have to be catatonic to stare at some of these images this long and move as slowly at these characters. this isn't real life unless you are heavily medicated.finally, i felt that schott√©'s portrayal was a sad rip-off of peter sellers' masterful "chauncy gardner." he uses the same facial expressions and postures. he even gardens! in many respects there are parallels between these two movies. the main difference being that "being there" moves along and doesn't rely on shock and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things we take for granted in life.

this two and a half hour long film was shown recently at carnegie mellon university (cmu) at a 10 pm show. there was a scheduled 1 am show after that, but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 3:30 am. the opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. it is an ominous sign of what's to come: a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same. there is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. it is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of film time (audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds, as to say, "what's the message?"). the story resembles dostoyevsky's novel "the karamazov brothers", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. in one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening) was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldn't see things clearly since the eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from english system to metric system to "they couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour". what was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it. this was no film kitchen 8-mm experiment. it was carefully planned, structured, acted, montaged. yet, i got so little out of it. some comments indictated on the excruciating detail, such as the minutae of a dandling key chain on a door just opened. okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? some corageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour. the rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the end. there never was. and maybe that's what the film is about. all the movies at the theater are action-packed. this one wants to be different. there is nothing happening.

the premise of the movie had much going for it, however, despite the novelty of models selling off someone else's furniture to live the high life, this movie has nothing going for it. the characters are cardboard. the dialog is so painfully scripted, it's hard to sit through, and if there were any jokes in the movie, i missed them. marilyn monroe's walking into walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable & not funny. grable's stupidity is also too ham-fisted to be believed. bacall's gold-digging is so forced, it's annoying to listen to. why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me.

in this film gary oldman plays a defense attorney, who was formerly a prosecutor. he is a bit tormented, but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of figurative or literal monster. funny thing is, he doesn't quite pull it off. i guess you can't quite get to normal from there. kevin bacon was sufficiently creepy. the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false scares. and the odd sex scene with oldman and karen young seemed to have come from a different movie, although the rest of the time miss young did just fine. this film suffers from oddness trying to cover up the predictability. and failing. don't bother.

i really hope the makers of these "movies" read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies. they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror. whether or not this was better than the first doesn't matter cause theyre both just plain terrible. i'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie. stop now!! warning to horror movie watchers, dont watch, rent or look at the boxes of "urban" horror films, and above all, don't buy them!!!!

suburban kids meet the forest. killjoy is better in this part. he is more wicked and stronger as well. nevertheless, most part of the acting is bad as well, like in the first one. sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing. i made an error to watch this one sober. you'll probably enjoy it more if you are not ;-). if you did not already stop loving clowns after the first movie, you definitely will after the second.....;-)problem kids and their watchers are on their way to a camp in the forest. and what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of a forest and.....at night? that's just their luck. they find a house and one got shot, one of the watchers stays behind (why i do not know) and the rest eventually finds another house. in that house a voodoo priestess lives.....but she is not responsible for the resurrection of killjoy. who is it then? well, you better watch the movie and find out for yourselves....

the movie starts off promisingly enough, the use of imagery and simple short clips convey the bigger story, which would normally need a considerably higher budget than the one here. however it did start to worry me as it continued, combined with another overly husky max payne type voice over the movie was starting to look not so good. i hoped it was just the introduction to the story.the story is what really caught me and took me to this movie. the idea that a research scientist has created a virus that actually protects the cells it infects from other infection was an interesting scientific idea. then that subjects who had the most bizarre disorders sought out the scientist and offered to be his human experiments made me think this could be one very good small movie. yet the introduction hadn't gone well.there did seem to be a change of pace as the movie turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters in the movie, the test subjects. although the acting wasn't superb, there seemed to be a lot of scope for character development throughout the movie, and the recordings were done quite well with a varied mix of characters. however these faded through the movie. they weren't used again after a few brief clips and i did feel that there was a missed opportunity to provide some great character development by reflecting back to them, however it wasn't to be.the imagery becomes increasingly disconnected from the story, often repeating to represent something that is still happening. this disconnection and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting commentary. it began reciting words one after the other. short, meaningless sentences and reciting none too relevant or interesting scientific ramblings. if there was something to be described, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looping,...you're getting the idea.now this could have been to reflect the confusion and of the character, slowly becoming caught up in his own thoughts, rambling due to lack of food and water. what it actually did was to cause me to totally switch off to the voice and by the closing stages of the movie i found that i hadn't been listening to some of the ramblings.a number of times that an event occurs the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful. there are repeated fades from the same scene to the same scene, for instance a character sleeping fades to black, then fades back in on the character sleeping again. look, we know the character is asleep, we know time has passed, please move on. overall there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging shots to fill time.the acting was not bad, and the characters were okay, but not exploited and developed. when they were interacting there were some truly cringeworthy moments. for example when one of them asks if they are hungry the camera looks to each of them and returns to a group shot, they pause, look to each other, turn back to camera and say slowly "no". it raised a snigger or two. their dialogue was slow, glossy and either it was missing altogether or totally unnecessary, there seemed to be no middle ground where the dialogue hit spot on.however, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find unless you viewed them in isolation, and this is what it almost looks like has happened with this movie. the film has been looked at as a series of scenes and not as a complete story.nowhere is this seen more than in the main storyline. the characters are infected with the virus that has been killing the animals, the one that was being engineered for them. we're told that it develops in stages to something dramatic, and so that is what we expect. what we get are the characters eating loads together, all throwing up once together, water pouring from their mouths in unconvincing streams, then they all fall asleep, these are the phases which all happen really early in the movie. then, they all say "good" together when asked how they are, and that's it. that's the virus done, nothing else happens.there could have been so much more done with this movie, so much more developed with the virus and it protecting them from all manner of harm. it could have explored a serious change of these characters as it infected and took over them, it could have developed these characters, shown them making decisions and doing things that connect back to their character shown in flashbacks to the interviews.the ending isn't even confusing, intriguing or thought provoking. it just shows something that happens and that's it, although in the long, drawn out style with the irritating voice over above it. i really struggled with this movie and watched a number of press members walk out (including one famous tv critic leaving within the first twenty minutes), i stayed, but regretted the lost time.

starring: james belushi; peter dinklage; alex neuberger and jason lee underdog is a true hero's tale. here is the story of shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle. when he is dog napped by a megalomaniac midget hell-bent on destruction, something freaky happens.our quirky little neighborhood pooch gains extraordinary powers. he can run as fast a cheetah; fly as fast a superhero and has the power of thunder. he is no longer shoeshine; he is underdog ¬ñ the best crime-fighter in the animal kingdom. the city cannot sleep until underdog rids it of the evil midget dr. simon barsinister and his cronies.if you fancy some really light-hearted entertainment with all the clich√©s of superhero action flicks, then this one is for you. as for quality entertainment, this one is strictly for the juniors. those of you hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast-fading star -james belushi - a word of caution: this is not one of his finer works.

jason lee does well to give this doggy movie fleeting promise, but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedythis live-action, cg-enhanced adventure sees a shamed police dog (jason lee) transformed into a super-dog via an accident in the lab of scheming scientist dr. simon barsinister (peter dinklage). underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret - a challenge given that he can both talk and fly.the odd gag raises a smile, but underdog's human sidekicks (james belushi and alex neuberger as father and son) are as dull as the predictable storyline. one for kids too young to have seen superman. or spider-man. or even shaggy dog¬Ö

i didn't like underdog!i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn't like it.this wasn't like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents(who grew up watching the cartoon)to come with there kids to come see this,i am neither of them so the film didn't appeal to me in the slightest.i had some problems with it like i don't think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligent.then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad.the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic.the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude.the acting was passable but needed a little improvement.if you have kids they might enjoy it, but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10

story of the creation of underdog and adventures battling simon bar sinister in a live action format. first we have showshine picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where simon bar sinister works. he fights back when sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and accident occurs, he gets superpowers and the lab blows up wounding sinister. on the street shoeshine runs afoul of riff raff, another dog and gets picked up by jim belushi who was a guard at the lab. belushi's son discovers that shoeshine has all these powers and eventually shoeshine becomes underdog, who will once again battle sinister.once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not. for me the film half works and half doesn't. the part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with his master. some of the repartee is funny, but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to sweet polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff. its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film. its painfully dull and feels like it takes forever to get through it, which considering the film is say 75 minutes sans credits, is something you don't want to do.the parts that are good are anything with simon bar sinister (peter dinklage is a blast) and anything where underdog goes into action. some how somewhere they managed to find a way to be both twistedly true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it. of course i could be wrong since the middle section is so dull, but i think not, since i do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable.as a whole its probably as awful as some people have said, but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts, this is an okay cartoon to film adaption. (but wait for cable-really)

i though that it was hard, if not impossible, to watch, and not because of the horrors it depicts but by the way they were depicted. imagine what costa gavras could have done with this true horror story. what i object to is the idea the need to denounce, which i subscribe to, is enough. what about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema. i feel that the eagerness of the filmmaker, maybe even the justifiable anger, didn't allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. or, if this was a cinematic point of view, i mean, a choice, then, i didn't like it at all. i was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the movie itself. well intentioned i'm sure, but, unfortunately, that's not nearly enough.

the nest is really just another 'nature run amock' horror flick that fails because of the low budget. the acting is ok, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me. the gore effects are not the best i've seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way. the roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people. the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs. if you liked the nest then slugs is a must-see as it's ten times better. also worth noting is that lisa langlois who plays elizabeth was in another 'nature run amock' type film called deadly eyes (aka the rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch, but you'd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory.

worst movie ever!! its not clever or funny or thought provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script.acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing.maybe the writer/director combination believed they were quentin tarantino or something (you know make a movie about nothing still cool) but failed miserably.i hope the writer never makes another movie ever!! not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever.please don't watch this movie, even on mute with the stereo going its still a painful 84 mins.

honestly, people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction. this is the level that we are dealing with here.the movie isn't bad but no way is it like "omg, the best movie since pulp fiction!". some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of indie variety. personally, i found my interest in the movie waned after the half-hour mark. the plot defies logic and belief. you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order "to save her husband". yeah, right. i guarantee that you would walk out of the theatre thinking, "hmm, now that doesn't make sense at all." this is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief.those who said that the music score is good were probably listening to their mp3 players. it absolutely killed the movie in some parts.in conclusion, watch the movie only if you have nothing particular important to do. i give this a three because there is one long sex sequence in the motel which is decent.

i should've realised it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this film bored me.having watched several "indie" films on the strength of the reviews on here, and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to those other reviewers, i began wondering if it's possible i am watching completely different films from these people, or are they perhaps friends/family etc of the film makers trying to 'big up' their work? hmmm.are you interested in seeing an amateur's homage to pulp fiction and 11:14, except done with worse actors, a silly score (undermines various scenes) and unbelievable jumps in logic? if not, then skip this film.here is my open letter to two of the players in this film.alfonso morgan, please, please, please, stop trying to 'be' samuel l jackon a la pulp fiction. no-one can do what he does as well as he does.director, please come up with something original. it does you a disservice to churn out this stuff pretending to be quentin tarantino.simply dire, and i really cannot see how anyone could say this is a good film. it is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8.5 on this, the same as films like pulp fiction or goodfellas. it is no-where near these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, i give it a 3.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. thank god i saw it for free. i would have hated to waste my money on it.first off, there isn't a character in the movie that is in any way likable. michael caine comes close, but even he is pretty flawed. the rest of the "commandos" are made up of disgusting ex-cons. there are the two gay arabs, and three guys who try to rape a red cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no trouble sending his men off to get killed so he can escape.the "mission" is anything from suspenseful. they are to blow up a fuel dump. sounds exciting, right? well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and fixing flat tires. yes, you read that right. the "suspense" is whether they will run out of spare tires. we actually watch them change something like 12 flats on the way. that's how incredibly exciting this movie is.they get to the fuel dump to find that it is a decoy. so, nothing to blow up. and at this time, for some very convoluted reason, the british army decides that they don't need these guys anymore, and radios their whereabouts to the germans to kill them.so, now at least we'll have an exciting race to freedom? nope, instead, they decide to blow up a different fuel dump, to create a diversion. but, when they get into the place, they set off a trip wire, and the germans come to get them -- calling out their names over a loudspeaker.really weird. if the germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them get all the way into the dump before springing the "trap?" instead, they wait until they get into the fuel depot, and set all of their charges. yeah. right. that would happen.so, they blow the dump, the leader sells out all of his men -- except for michael caine, since he's been offered $2000 to bring him back alive.ok... so, the men are all betrayed and killed, and michael caine and nigel davenport survive. the british troops come in with tanks, and they decide to go get rescued. since they are wearing german uniforms (they wore them to blow up the dump) they tie a white flag around a stick and walk out into the road.some british guy walks up behinds them and machine guns them to death. credits roll.yep. the two "heroes" of the movie die due to a random act of violence.it's almost like the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided: "that's a wrap. kill them off and we'll go home." i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a gracefulness of a bomb.

it's great to hear the 3 or so comments, that point out what 'footballers wives' signifies for women. the title alone, washes away any supposed equality women have in the media industry or society, reducing them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave . it is a post modern moronic farce. it might as well be called, 'footballers wifey who stays at home and knows her place'.on one hand, it could actually be some sort of parody on the u.k.'s, gutter trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society. so women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by mens desire. nah, that would be to ironic and clever. i also sound like i should be praising it.zoe lucker is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously. just like an even cheaper cruella de ville. she just needs some maniacal, condescending, yet at the same time, self appraising laugh to show off her true acting range. oh she does? right. anyway, it just about sums up whom this is aimed at. either 'clever clever' journo's, who think its an up-roaring send-up of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think its 'real'. "finest actors"? omg!! stop watching this afterbirth of a pantomime and get a life.its utterly sexist and is of such low quality, that maybe those who enjoy it think they are "in" on the "joke". do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? its so demeaning to women and men. they are not all self centred, selfish, football loving materialistic jerks, who think women are nothing but another trophy to be put on display for the public. it's so humiliating. i am sure ms lucker would easily stand up to them in her "real" life, and twist them round her finger as so easily done in 'footballers wives' .but of course, its doesn't really matter. i mean its only a t.v. programme after all. so please let it stay axed. it's dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that 'prisoner cell block h' was so fondly remembered for.how did it come to exist? it sure ain't subtle or complex. it could only come from the same mind set who read fhm magazine, and think its "alright" to look at soft-porn, and "do" as many women who bow to their "will" and chant patriotic and racist comments whenever "their" football team losses/wins. it's totally crass.

what was the aim here...i started to have a look at it but then i realized that it had no aim...poor acting...no action and no story..i ended up listening to it while i was surfing the web reading about david beckham's $250 million dollar us soccer galaxy contract. do not rent this don't borrow this not worth a down load i've seen so many films that i could sense that this was going to be crap from the get go.war films should be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually not feel like christian melodrama...this film pales in comparison to any that i've seen before.i must say that iam truly disappointed at this film..

this is quite possible the worst movie ever made. i know people talk about how horrible ed wood movies were (plan 9) but this movie makes plan 9 look amazing.chuck norris makes a cameo, for what reason i have no idea. perhaps to ruin his movie career. aside from chuck norris, the movie's cast consists of extras in daytime soaps and mike norris... that's right, chuck's son.this director doesn't even have a resume and i have no idea where the plot or screenplay originated. this must've been green lit by a horrible southern baptist minister that somehow had a 3rd cousin that owned a studio (which i'm sure has since been shut down).i don't really know what else to say about this movie. i would like to give you a plot summary but i'm lost. there is something about jesus and satan... some eternal battle. other than that there are indians. and a bunch of freaky kids that don't know how to act... they're just awkward and should not be on camera. i don't know what was going on most of the time but i know the movie was a great laugh. mike norris pushes his daughter (on her bike) into the street somehow... but in the shot he's in the middle of the park. so somehow she learns to ride her bike with speed equivalent to that of the flash and gets hit by a car or bus... i don't know. but she's dead. this is actually the funniest scene in the movie. i know that sounds sick but once you see mike raise his hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in terror... you'll understand. it doesn't show the daughter getting hit or anything... you just have to assume she got hit by some vehicle. but, the movie's not clear. so maybe it was completely unrelated and she died from cancer. anyway... after that the movie gets really confusing and i have no idea what really happens. i am a christian and i have no idea why this movie was made. i don't see any value for this movie in a religious or non-religious sector. this is probably the first thing they show students in film-making 101... this is what you don't want to do.just see it... you'll hate it and me for suggesting that you see it.

i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far, the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. this movie was made in 2003 and i've seen movies made in the 60's with better special effects. i wish i could go into detail, but words can't describe how crappy this movie was. i could have done better with a home video camera and $20! i pray that chuck norris never makes a movie again. now if you think i'm downing this movie because it has a christian theme, you're wrong. i like the fact that il' chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make god look good, but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie? this whole film can be summed up in 3 words: re damn diculous.

wow, this is anti-christian bias big-time! this is based on a stephen king novel and he written this kind of bias before and then hollywood exaggerates it even more. in this film, we see a protestant minister and a catholic priest both act like fools and be profane at the same time. of course, the devil has taken over the town so maybe his influence is into these guys, too, but they are typical hollywood portrayals. they never show a minister who talks and acts like billy graham, or your local minister or priest. and - another "given" - they make the satan character the most interesting of the film. max von sydow plays the devil and makes him a likable guy. ironically, von sydow has played a number of these roles after portraying jesus in the 1964 film, "the greatest story ever told." you wonder why actors are so screwed up? they don't know if they are god, satan or anyone in between.ed harris, who played a lot of unlikeable roles up until the last few years, is appropriately cast in this story. he and the rest of the mean-spirited characters in this film do not make it fun to watch.from what i've heard, king's book is even darker and more sick than this hate-filled movie but better constructed. frankly, who cares. king and hollywood deserve each other.

i am a fan of ed harris' work and i really had high expectations about this film. having so good actors as harris and von sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do? i really think that needful things is the worst movie of harris' filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake. anyway, i've seen much worse movies in my life but needful things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. the story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake. i don't know if that is because of the book, 'cause i haven't read it. but if the script was so bad, i can't see the reason for filming it. maybe it was the commercial success of king's books, or the need for low-quality movies for the vhs era of the 90's. whatever the reason was, though, this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved.

based on a stephen king novel, needful things provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat. a mysterious man(max von sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in maine? von sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. also starring are ed harris and bonnie bedelia. harris is steady and bedelia is deserving of your attention. also in support are j.t. walsh and amanda plummer. not the best, nor the worst adaptation of king's horror on the screen.

this movie is based on a stephen king novel in which mysterious new shopkeeper leland gaunt (max von sydow) offers each citizen of castle rock the item he or she most desires - but there is a heavy price to be paid for these transactions. local sheriff alan pangborn (ed harris) is soon forced to deal with a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances.below average for stephen king cinema: i can see why some people would think it was boring. it plods along without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time (yet again) with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hatred of each other is spooky.i do enjoy the novel and don't believe that this lackluster movie does it justice. there are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen.von sydow makes gaunt much too charming. we're supposed to be scared of gaunt at the right times, not amused by him. i also hate it that the sheriff's primary deputy (ray mckinnon) is written and portrayed as such an annoying, barney fife-type moron. star ed harris looks as if he was forced into doing this picture by his agent, but professional that he is, he really sinks his teeth into his dialog. bonnie bedelia (as pangborn's love interest polly) and amanda plummer (in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles) come the closest to creating characters who are likable.yet it is also foul and mean-spirited.although i'll be darned if it didn't feel a little cathartic watching a bunch of unlikable movie characters tear each other to pieces. the climax has some good explosions.i often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve, but in this case i feel i should really be honest and just say: 3/10.

star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits based on another of stephen king's lengthy novellas, this takes place in the sleepy little new england town of castle rock (also the name of the film's production company!), where a new antiques store, the titular needful things, has opened. the owner and proprietor, leland gaunt (max von sydow) hides, you might say, a devilish secret. there's an item in his store that everyone in the little town wants-a small cash price upfront is first required, before a far more sinister price is asked for. as suspicion, hate and madness tear the town apart, it falls to police chief alan pangborn (ed harris) to restore order and save the town from a terrifying end...i read the novel of needful things earlier this year, and was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them (like that was going to be any contest!) but it had been deleted on video and dvd and i couldn't find anywhere to rent it from. so i was happy when i finally found it in a flea market whilst on a shopping trip...it's one of the cruelest ironies that king novels are generally the best to read but when they get adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk, as is the case here. the material that makes his books great simply doesn't translate into a movie script very well, for some reason. and i suppose there's always the question: why bother watching this when i could be reading the book again instead? i appreciate that some are simply too lengthy (i.e. it, the stand) to be made into a complete screen work with all the situations and characters included, but there's no reason this one couldn't have included all the material from the book. as a result, a lot of key characters from the book (i.e. ace merrill) are not included at all and we have some terrible character development that means we don't care about the characters that are involved since they are so stripped of depth and motivation- for example we have one character from the book, danforth keaton, who murders his wife toward the end yet we were shown no build-up to hint at any reason that he didn't get along with or hated her and so it has no impact when it happens, unlike in the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved. all the material in the script to fill in the cracks, if you like, is really stupid and corny and the typically goofy stuff that gets included in king adaptations like this.most of the film's problems are that it deviates so far away from the book but there's also some terrible acting from a cast that obviously can't feel for the daft material they're being asked to perform. in the 90s, a lot of king's work started skipping the cinema and just being made into made-for-tv/video territory. rubbish like this must surely hint at why. **

so many great actors, so little worth watching. but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, i don't hold it against anyone on screen. though flawed, the book was one of grisham's only that i truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. i also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. in the movie characters are given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so stilted. the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional. but as with so much of joel schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. so preachy, stilted, and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy, i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.

regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film - that vigilante justice is acceptable - is justifiable, i was more insulted by mcconaughey's closing statement. in a courtroom drama, the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film, and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one, the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury. this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl. i for one find this very insulting. as for the rest, i found the acting reasonable, with the exception of sandra bullock, who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self (doesn't really work in a courtroom drama), but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one. it tells you that vigilante justice is fine, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.

this movie endorses self-justice! it grants freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he gets of scat-free! despicable enough as this may be, there is also adultery in this film. the connaughey character has the hots for the bullock character and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films (like the important news brought to the court in the nick of time)that make every aesthetically demanding film-goer such as me sick! i really cannot believe that someone liked this junk. it is a film so bad and holding up false ideals that i am unable to put my critic in an eloquently pleasing way. when will the american people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24/7 by films like these that turn reality into some bs where there is justice for all if only they take it into their hands. this cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with america!

i have not read "a time to kill" by john grisham, and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better. but perhaps not. i hear this is the most faithful grisham adaption yet, and if that is true, i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when grisham introduced it as his first work."a time to kill" is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. it wants to be a suspenseful crowd-pleasing thriller and, at the same time, a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. let's face it, those two types of films do not go together in hollywood, which is why "dead man walking" had to be made independently.the story involves a young lawyer named jake (matthew mcconaughy) out to defend a black man named carl (samuel l. jackson) from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. the day before the rapists' trial, carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building, he charged out and shot both of them dead. to help out with the defense, jack accepts the help of a former law student (sandra bullock), who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary, and put in the film only for marketing purposes.meanwhile, one of the rapist's kid brother (kiefer sutherland) was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. all of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse, a kidnapping, a brutal beating, and race riot. i'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film, in addition to the courtroom scenes. what i later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.the main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. this film, however, doesn't seem to think so. besides that, there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. for example, there is an unknown character called mickey mouse, who is a member of the klan, and, for reasons unknown, is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the klan. after bullock is kidnapped by sutherland and company, and left for dead in the wilderness, this unknown person comes and saves her---and we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.and speaking of the sutherland character's reign of terror, it's amazing how witless the police and the bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. there's a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot jake as he comes out, shooting one of the guards instead. now you'd think since there are dozens of police around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. no such luck. from what we could see, no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. even after bullock, was rescued by mickey mouse, she never, ever mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it even questioned. why was this? simple. the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense, although logically, he should have been out of the picture.besides bullock's character, there another thankless character. he is jake's assistant played by oliver platt. there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie--to supply a number of one-liners for the audience. in my opinion, one-liners show a major weakness in "serious" films when used. it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.but enough of the film's many minor problems. what about the film's message here? it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder. we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity, etc that caused him to kill. in desperation, jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. after describing everything that took place, he adds on one final line..."the girl is white". we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.in the very next scene, a girl comes out yelling "he's free! he's free!". wait a minute! do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? most of all, why weren't there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. i'll tell you why. they couldn't show the delibertion because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. what is the message? that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation, because in reality, there would not be an acquittal. but since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. if people start killing as a form of revenge, the makers of this film should be held responsible. what a socially irresponsible film this is!

first things first - though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often (as here) downright bad, the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based on.set at an undetermined point in time (the 50s? the 70s? now?), the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that "at least we're not that bad"¬Ö cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father, samuel l jackson, fearful they will get off on some technicality, guns them down in cold blood before the trial. the setting is a 'deep south' that probably never existed - the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton, the dyed-in-the-wool racists (kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a klansman) are laughable in their villainy. the set-piece is the trial: for the defence, are the "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma, his assistant played by sandra bullock's breasts (she doesn't seem to serve any other narrative purpose) and donald sutherland as the requisite drunk-lawyer-who-sobers-up-to-fight-the-good-fight. for the prosecution, kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn, while in the town at large, crosses are burned, witness are intimidated and the local citizens don't seem to care¬Ö some of the reviews here claim the film immoral, since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart-tugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey. to be honest, objectionable though the underlying message "vigilante justice is good" might be, everything about the movie stinks: the characterizations are pitiful, the acting leaden, the direction plodding, the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody. peter menzies lush, 50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative. and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours!! what's left to say? this is a waste of 141 minutes of anyone's life, it is tedious, vacuous and hammy, and, almost as an afterthought, it is morally repugnant.

there are other reviews here expressing similar views, but i still feel impelled to add my comments. the film is generally well-made from a technical point of view, apart from possibly being too long. the acting is mostly very good, although kevin spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism), and sandra bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy, which she admittedly manages very well.at a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism, and i get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. however, it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew (i haven't read the book, so i don't know how much of that is down to grisham). the biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice. aside from the fact that i don't agree with that position, i don't think that such a view actually helps the anti-racist cause at all - it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. at the end the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it's ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. it's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt, which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case.samuel l jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he comes across as someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea (and indeed he doesn't, when push comes to shove). we're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty, but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter, although if you blink you might miss it. why not take it, given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim? or if he wants to make a stand in court, why plead insanity?there are less serious flaws too. the medical experts, on whose testimony the case supposedly rests, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. the message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say, and shouldn't be believed. the fact that the injured policeman supports jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and what if he had died?) i find it hard to believe that the kkk would march down the street in broad daylight. other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. and the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous.my final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty - as though i must be a racist because i disagree with the resolution. it may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide, but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end. the film did make me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so at some level maybe it succeeded - but i worry that it may have re-inforced highly illiberal views in some people, which i hope is the opposite of what it intended.final thought - try watching law and order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!

a time to kill is based on john grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that didn't skyrocket him to fame. (that would be accomplished by "the firm"). that's why this movie didn't get made until much later, after grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. it had meat, it had weight, and it had heart.but it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie. namely, "a time to kill" sets you up.here we have a black man (jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. we have an underdog lawyer (mcconaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. and oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in mississippi, complete with hooded kkk men burning crosses.in other words, we're supposed to sympathize with carl lee hailey. we're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. we're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. we're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting "free carl lee".but the racism issue is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is contrived. carl lee hailey was a vigilante. yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent. this would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else.and what's so heavy-handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes carl lee should have been convicted is a racist. the message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands, then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood.this isn't the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. as a movie, a time to kill stays pretty faithful to the book, and the acting isn't half bad. but it played the hand it had been dealt, really. even a good cast can't elevate bad source material.

this is the worst kind of film.the plot is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves. are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s "good boys" and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation? are black people universally inspiring? do the ku klux klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening? do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting "kill him"? do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the klan waiting to hear the verdict? do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing? do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? worst of all, any high-minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience. was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands here? is it really a subject that belongs in hollywood hands? and if so, why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of sandra bullock? and the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses? seems like the director didn't feel that strongly about sex crime after all.this was taking the excellent plot of to kill a mockingbird and making a crass, shallow, tasteless money-spinner from it. shame on them.

normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. it is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies. and i really did my best to enjoy the movie. but i just couldn't. the jokes aren't funny enough! (i've seen my share of japanese movies. and most of the times i like and understand the humor used in those movies. "red shadow" is just silly!)the characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isn't a serious movie and show that all is about the fun. look at the characters from parodies like "hot shots" or "scary movie". everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character! and because of this, certain scenes become funny and hilarious. in "red shadow" the actors never achieve that. the shadow ninja's supposed to be very skilled and deadly. sadly the actors don't do their best in convincing us of their talents. they don't do things with a straight face. the jokes would have worked better if they did! the bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me. i like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. "red shadow" just fails in that department. so what is left to be enjoyed. well,the music (techno) was uplifting. it had to be as the action it self never is exciting. and there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. the use of humor,lack of story and depth make me think that this movie is meant for children. but i do wonder if children actually would like this movie. waste of time!

what can you say after watching this movie? that is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end. i was left speechless, due to the amazingly dull story, annoying situations where one american equals that of a fifty or more iraqis, and boring dialogue. i think that if this movie has something to teach, it probably goes like "don't screw with us, or we'll come and kick your butts". plus, this film truly encourages and votes for killing masses of foreigners, in the name of war. i got the image of tackling chess pieces out of the playing board. except, now it's fast and there's not so much thinking. and on top of that.. no character there has any spirit; then, how can you care at all what happens to any of them. excluding war movie fans with no taste, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. there should always be something more interesting to do.

bad sequels.....this one's a real one! when the first movie was very very bad, you have to be fool to make a sequel.....worse actors, worse scenario,worse special effects,worse movie!!! this is history! bad history! i give it 0 and a half (for laughs) out of *****.

can anyone give me a reason why only one american dies in this movie, and when he does, it is supposed to be a very emotional scene, yet when the operation delta force team kills hundreds of russians, in slow-motion action scenes, or thousands of arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, you are supposed to cheer and say "take that, you non-american monsters!". i know i used "slow-motion action scenes" a lot, but that is because every action scene in this movie is in, you guessed it, slow-motion. every last one of them... and this squad should be called "invincible slow-motion bullet-dodging force", since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets. and if this supernatural power fails, they have some kind of regeneration superpower, which is all they need to kill the complete non-american army that stands between them and victory. by this point, nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slow-motion action scene... that is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting, cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story. which is what i did... the cast is made of unknown actors, which will probably remain unknown since they don't even play characters. they are just playing guys with guns(and, lets not forget, superpowers)... the only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that bad(although they are in slow-motion) for a tv movie... but it still sucks... and at the same time is so bad it's good... ok, maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitive...25%

let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts, and i do indeed know they exist. i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this. people forget there is more than one "bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible. not everyone believes in god, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. religion does not make everything fact, one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is ok, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. none of this, "oh that was the old testament, and now we have the new testament." if the bible is the word of god, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, "is no other way." the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic, or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher. but anyhow, onto the review. i am a decent fan of "ghost hunters" and when i heard this show was coming soon, i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. as much as i like watching "ghost hunters", i do not like some of their members, and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. i am glad they are skeptical, but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. if ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. it's more of a "right place at the right time" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it's going to "perform" for you? this show is kind of silly. it's usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. the main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed.also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as i believe very few of them are actually gifted. silvia brown is one i definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe.i really wanted to like this show, but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed.

this show was rushed, and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials (when it came back from commercial, the noise or "surprise" was something simple like a mouse) this is a pure rip-off of ghost hunters and it attempts to go "beyond" them, and fails miserably. also, what is with the directors log thing? is this star trek? it just ruins the novelty of this show, which wore off quick. the only reason it's been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anti-climatic nature of it. they never find anything, and most likely never will. funnily enough, they always point out something that is the thing they are "hunting" and guess what?! it's the local radio station's tower light that is blinking red!

i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes. but this kid and his buddies conduct their investigations like total idiots. they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it. but beyond that, the show's whole format is incredibly annoying. even though a lot of it seems scripted, the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use "big" words they obviously don't understand. and head investigator ryan's ridiculously self important voiceovers make me just want to throw the tv through the window. (and he looks stoned all the time). in short, this group make the guys from taps on ghost hunters look like mit scientists!

even if ryan wasn't such of an annoying person, this would still be bad, i said even if, where do we begin? "directors log" you will have the urge to snatch his tape recorder and pound it with a hammer or punt it into a lake, a haunted lake of course. oh how i wish "dead time" was more literal as opposed to what they refer to it as, but alas, no death, maybe a pillow out of place or a "humming noise" oh wait thats the cat. i actually expected to see some sort of evidence or at least something to verify their escapades, don't worry you wont see anything you that you would not see on a normal day.an entire season and what do they have to show for it, um nothing. no in fact they have less than nothing, they have a waste of time. they took my challenge, the do something for the paranormal challenge. now in this you actually do something for the paranormal, you could say go on camera and say "i love the paranormal so much i'll draw stick figures of ghosts" or " i love the paranormal so much i'll film hot co-eds pretending to be ghost hunters" you would be wasting film, but wasting it for the paranormal. or you could say "i'll mess with a demon" but don't say it's name you might get hurt, and you know god doesn't like that, that would be quite a thing for god but he wouldn't like that so don't do that. so i asked them to waste time for the paranormal and they followed suit, they went into an old building looking for "mothman", it was a waste of time, it made no real difference at all, it had no effect, we learned nothing new, it was a waste of time and film.there amazing detective work is just so uncanny, "well we found your problem" a cat died here so were going to psychically communicate with that cat and tell it to move on, kind of throw some catnip at it, and it'll be ok......directors log...." captain log star date 541.2 ...oh i mean " directors log, i just brought on a few new investigators, a couple 8's and 9's but this chic is a 10....um yeah....we have a new case... strange things happening.... .......focusing on one of the children.....were going to investigate.." now we will bring is a psychic, we haven't told them anything this is tv trust us,

i am a fan of the paranormal and i love ghost hunters so when this show first came out i decided to give it a try. i could barely sit through one episode. the show is so obviously staged. i mean come on, every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. another huge flaw is that these guys never debunk anything. when i watch ghost hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't then it is evidence. on this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. this completely ruins their credibility unlike taps and ghost hunters who actually know what they're doing. honestly if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it watch ghost hunters.

i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a&e. i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence. the production value looked good and i really love the logo. then, after about few episodes in, i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda.it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that can't even make a teacup move on camera, yet everyone is terrified. then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone.also, there is very little focus on other members of the team. the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street.has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity, scaring people to convert? really, this should be on a christian network. i was very disappointed.

i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on a&e. i've been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid, and love catching "ghost hunters" when it's on (scifi channel). i've tried to watch three episodes of "paranormal state" and only use up my time commenting on it because it's so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak. "paranormal state" is beyond cheesy. cheesy "director's log" voice-overs that will leave you wishing for captain kirk. cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context. everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... like in "poltergeist" you almost expect the team to leave and say "this house is clear." i very much appreciate the "ghost hunters" approach, where they go in to disprove claims, then take away what they can ... and they are almost always reassuring to the client (if they find anything) that haunted does not equal evil. "paranormal state" is not "so bad it's good" ... it's just plain bad. didn't a&e used to stand for "arts & entertainment"? the art part has long been gone, and the entertainment factor is now waning as well.

there really are no redeeming factors about this show. to put it simply, its just terrible. absolutely dreadful. it's just a dreadful "reality" show. not only that, it's dreadful fiction.imagine this: a bunch of overly-imaginative teenagers get together one night and go "hey! let's make a paranormal show just like "ghost hunters" and whatnot!" so they grab a camera, harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully "trying-to-be-dramatic-yet-failing-misreably" monologue. this show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. the only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers. a wasted budget and terrible writers.oh, the problems, how do i count thee? well, first off, let's talk about this from a personal level. i am not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. i am willing to believe in whats paranormal and whats not, and i'm sure there are a lot of people who feel the same. so, if you're going to do a show about the paranormal, you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they're seeing is either paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. i hate to compare, but i don't see why not at this point. take "ghost hunters" for example. in "ghost hunters" you can tell that the cast is leveled with the audience. they're not totally skeptical, yet they're still willing to keep the possibility of any paranormal anomalies in mind. they have to look at something and be willing to say "this is possible that its simply nothing". and, with that in mind, they set out to try and prove themselves wrong. they use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal along with bearing the fact that what they may be monitoring could be nothing in mind. not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not, in the process they are trying to convince you. that element of doubt is not present in "paranormal state". strike one.in "paranormal state", the cast simply says "there's this spooky place, and its haunted, so we're going to find some spirits!" and immediately you know and saying to yourself "okay, convince me otherwise". the cast is not professional in their interviews. in fact, sometimes it seems like they're just harassing local residents of these so-called "haunted" areas. they have no real evidence to back up their claims besides assumptions and theories, and the best they can must up is somebody who "claims" they can contact the dead, with no one ever backing up who this person is and how valid they really are. they could have easily just picked some random person off the street and said "pretend you can contact spirits for our show" and went at it. in the "mothman" episode, this just happens. without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show, they bring this sort of individual out where he does a random, painfully scripted "reading" of a supposed area of how something is "haunted" in order to convince its audience. very, very poor effort. i feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels scripted. during one of the episodes, the cast gets attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" at times in an attempt to be dramatic. these sort of dramatic sequences would make any skeptic laugh and even those who are on the fence realize what they're watching is just a bunch of tabloid-esquire trash. if the show's aim was to try and convince their audience that these "paranormal" events are real, they're doing a horrifically poor job at doing so. strike two.however, there is always the counter. just one last viewpoint to see if the show is actually worth something. what if the show isn't trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction? it even fails on that level as well. if the show's creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience, the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level, it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full, horrifying glory. the writing is simply not compelling and even, dare i say, boring. strike three.so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera, a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary. thats all the show is at this point. there is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there's no reason to care about it. to be blunt, its lame. there are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show.

the atmosphere in this show is great. there's plenty of excellent buildup, but thats where this show fails. there's way to much build up for nothing. you will constantly see a creepy set up that makes it feel likes something really freaky is coming right out of the corner and then....nothing. over and over again nothing. you hear plenty of stories of people talking about freaky events but you see none. they show up at these peoples doors, talk about their deep and emotional pasts, set up lame equipment and find nothing! there is nothing on this show thats leads me to believe in anything paranormal. i laugh every time they need to exercise a "horrible spirit" that we as an audience have seen nothing of. they get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a neat little package. a show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads up to one thing...nothing!

"paranormal state" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. i enjoy watching what the "team" has to say and what they "find", however, i know that the entire show along with it's build ups and story lines are completely set up. they go to real haunted locations and i suspect that they speak with actual witnesses. i commonly feel as i watch it that i am not watching non-fiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality. i personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker. interesting show. stick to "ghost hunters"

this show, paranormal state, has an almost "blairwitch project" feel to it. as in, you're watching a 'documentary' that's actually just a scripted movie, made to look and feel like a documentary.my biggest problem with the show, is their 'go to' outside advisers of the warren's, who were made famous for their 'investigations' of the amityville murders, which were shown to be completely fraudulent, just based upon the police reports of the family's deaths! (such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) then there's the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything. not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take. they don't want to help those who need it most, they just want the weirdest cases, that will get them the most press and attention.they're complete frauds, plain and simple.

this show is absolutely ridiculous. yes, of course its fake. but it is agonizing to watch. i personally know more creative film influenced minds that could "make" this seem real. the young lead male couldn't be more unconvincing. he line-reads everything he says. are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about? there is a plethora of ways to blair-witch this show up. fear does not breed from what seems "cool" and computer generated. nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as "what was that? did you hear that?" also, there are real convincing psychics out there that don't just "want to be on screen". another duh-factor is... how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that paranormal activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days (if we are lucky) they film. i don't think so. a 2 + week at one site would be more convincing. it is also disarming that they think including "nasa radar checks" and computer's that show fancy bs really make us scared. and ie: exorcisms should not be staged like the film "the exorcist". when are they going to get it right? possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently. they don't just snarl and lower their voice like linda blair or fallel around like courtney love on a drug binge. as stated better concentrations on "psychic ability" would aid this show greatly. we want to see and hear everything that supposingly flashes before them. not cut-away to other story bs. on a final note- shooting stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of ufo's ahead of time. might i stress again the young dark haired man that hosts this show is absolutely down-right awful. avoid this show. for fright: watch old unsolved mystery episodes... not the new ones (the recreation got it oh-so wrong). but that is for a different blog.

this is a parody. that means, there are no characters as such, they are all plain stereotypes, and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes.well, there are quite some good jokes in this movie. unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones. if one expects all dialogues to be absurd, the fun wears off.you see, there is american pie 2, my all time favorite teenager movie. it contains a lot of real original characters. maybe the jokes are tasteless, but all the people have some kind of live. for example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. that is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny !not so this movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody, so there are no characters at all, therefore there is really no room for any sympathy. too, if you know the original movies, you know whole scenes in advance. add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie.the only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where i was watching the film.ah, and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of melissa joan hart in one scene. sigh. she is just too cool, she can't be real. hmm, worth a whole movie ?

this is a stupid movie. like a lot of these karate movies it is badly written, awkward, and sometimes just stupid. the action really isn't all there and the movie overall leaves much to be desired. everyone here is talking jive, doing bad karate and doing a very bad job of acting. watch for scatman crothers in a small role, he is too good for this movie overall. jim kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. gloria hendry is real bad. all of them are, there are just so many parts to this film that make absolutely no sense. the supposed love/running away scene with hendry and kelly, what the hell was that? they destroyed that man's guitar, for no reason! and then there was the mandatory girls on trampolines!!! now what was that? they were in the movie for five seconds, then you never heard from them again!!! then there is the whole racially charged element of the movie, which is cool and all, but in this movie it goes absolutely nowhere. like i said, this is good for a laugh one time, but don't watch it again.

another try, another miss. france may be doomed for not being able to produce a good horror movie. i mean... the least they could do was to shoot the movie in the forest of broc√©liande, but even the forest is fake ! it was shot near paris ! the subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish you were deaf. nothing could save it.bad... to the bone. i wasn't warned. i want my money back.

yes, absolutely dreadful, and this coming from someone who loves bad movies - but there's a limit. i enjoy all sorts of horror/suspense films, and have seen some wonderful work from european film makers. broceliande is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film-making. the camera work is worse than amateurish. not the fashionable, shaky mtv "cameraman needs ritalin" type of camera work so many film-makers use to camouflage their lack of talent. this is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition. the acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. the dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual run-of-the-mill horror/suspense film delving into pseudo-mysticism. i think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. these were bad to the point of being ludicrous. i've seen what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. this was just bad film-making. very, very sad.

what should i say? i only saw this flick for curiosity, and this is truly a shame... i grew up in brittany with stories of celtic legends, and spent 5 years in rennes, the town in which this film is said to take place... shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in rennes. they could at least have chosen a likely town, or a likely forest, but nothing even seem like brittany nor rennes... and calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience. besides those details, it could have been a good film, but it's crap. silly scenario, silly characters and no originality. definitely to avoid.

i hate this movie!!!!!! i have never seen such utter, complete trash in my life!!! i live in france so it turned out that i was in the front line to watch this awful movie. at first, it seemed cool, kind of like something about a cursed forest that chomps people. unfortunately, it turned out it was something quite different: a good start with a girl that meets a guy and all that whatnot, then the girl gets threatening messages in the form of ravens shut up in her bathroom closet(ludicrous), from that bit and on, the movie starts to slide downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate thrashing in the process. the movie ends with sacrificial druids galore and ancient ugly, stinky creatures coming back from the past to kill a few people. many questions were rushing around my head by then: why the heck did they bring back that scummy monster? do druids look like maniacs dressed in bedsheets? why did they even bother making this movie?? the "climax" of the movie was so goofy i laughed all the way through it: the "awful" stinky monster does battle with the two young women(who appear to be expert kung fu masters) and the professor gets sliced in two or something. what surprised me was that the monster was so slow and ungainly in battle, wasn't it supposed to be a god of war or something? anyway, the movie in it's death throws was a pitiful sight. a brief condensation of the contents of this movie: kung fu mayhem+druid stones+mysterious murders "√† la thriller"+ancient prophecies+shabby ravens+old clumsy boneless war god+nutty professor=complete and utter, diseased, boneless, worm eaten, godforsaken, goddam, recycled, fake, wannabe, ludicrous sh*t!!!!!!!!! things i learned from this movie: -ancient war gods are lousy at kung fu. -all young women who study archeology at university in france are kung fu experts. -professors are so resistant they can survive being sliced in two by a saw-mass-whatchamacallit without any injuries.

after a few misfires, we are still waiting for the french horror movie that the critics will certainly vilify, but will launch a new trend. not this time. doug headline can't be accused of not being knowledgable in the genre (he is editor of a high-class fantasy imprint, has worked for legendary magazine starfix.), but why a scenario that uses every clich√© in the book (except maybe the odious comic relief) ? why make it so predictable ? even the nods towards argento fails flat. it's not even an euro-teen movie like the german "anatomy", much better, just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features lots of plot holes. the whole "celtic" aspect is barely touched. and, after a "revenation" painfully predictable, the screenplay offers us a boring, endless chase in a subterranean necropole which seems bigger than parisian catacombs. i really wanted to love this film. really. but even a mother would not. oh, and writer valerio evangelisti was supposed to have a cameo, but i vainly looked for him.

the actresses are cute and the sets, while simple, quite ok. apart from this, there is nothing to save from this movie. incredibly bad acted, dumb to tears dialogues, all-too-expected plot, a lot of goofs and inconsistencies (for instance, a pretty young girl gets hits in the head by a morning star and not only she survives, but barely with a scratch !)... to make it short because it does not worth more, even the fans of the genre can avoid it.

in the early 00's, production companies had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after "the crimson rivers" and "brotherhood of the wolf" turned out to be hits, so several movies were green-lit or saved from their "direct-to-video" fate. however, france, as opposed to the us, uk or italy, has little tradition of fantasy b-movies and it turned out quickly that "samoura√Øs", "bloody mallory" or the "crimson rivers" sequel were ill-advised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place. as they flopped, producers have gone back to their usual fare: derivative farces or the umpteenth self-referential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from "les cahiers du cin√©ma"."broc√©liande" could only have been green-lit during this short window, as it serves no other discernible purpose. it's your by-the-book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and you'll find bimboesque female characters, a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you don't even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before, even before the movie started.these elements make all the fun of a 70's or a 80's b-movie and you expect them in a 70's or 80's movie. however, we're not in the 80's anymore and nobody warned director doug headline, as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie. headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80's but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "broc√©liande" a bore.when you put together clich√©s from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino, you get a "scream" or a "death proof", movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clich√©s and add a great deal to them. that's called "talent" and that's why you can't confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago."broc√©liande" takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies (unfortunately for the male viewer, the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing). there are very strong similarities (presumably unintentional) between the plot of "broc√©liande" and the reviled "halloween 3: season of the witch", as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night. as even the plot of "halloween 3" makes more sense than this one, it means that something seriously wrong went with "broc√©liande".

really!here the french cinema hits rock bottom ,and compared to it, the least appealing of the american adolescent horror movies,the likes of "friday the thirteenth" "freddy" and co are masterpieces of the seventh art.it's all the more infuriating as there were exciting original elements :the for√™t de broc√©liande and its legends ,the druids and king arthur ,all were splendid assets for a dreamlike fantasy and horror film.alas! filmed ,as an user aptly pointed out in a fake forest,near paris ,the movie is fake horror,fake celtic history,fake vestiges -you should see the professor (wilms who was a wonderful m.le quesnoy in "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille) scream for the "invaluable scrap" -which the production probably bought in a dime store-fake characters ,fake excavations...the boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny ;so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts.and what can we say of the professors? of the monster? a ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce.to think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer!word to the wise:maurice leblanc wrote a marvelous story dealing with druids and old ceremonies in his arsene lupin saga called "l'√Æle aux trente cercueils" .a miniseries was made 30 years ago.avoid this "broceliande" garbage and try to see it instead.

i really wanted to like this movie, because it is refreshingly different from the hordes of everyday horror movie clones, and i appreciate that the filmmakers are trying for something original. unfortunately, the plot just didn't hold together and none of the characters were likable enough for me to really care about them or their fates.visually, the toybox was pretty interesting. the director took a lot of somewhat risky moves, like adding in little bits of (flash-looking) animation in parts and really cheesing up some of the special effects (such as the light from a certain amulet). sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't, but he deserves kudos for the attempt, and the cinematography was generally of high quality.unfortunately, when this same approach of throwing lots of things at the wall to see what sticks was applied to the plot, the results were not very good. the film never really finds a tone that it likes, moving schizophrenically from black comedy to family soap opera to 80's witchcraft flick to childhood nostalgia to embattled-family slasher. taken on their own, bits and pieces of each of these elements work fairly well, but nothing ever coheres into a satisfying whole. besides that, large bits of the plot are never really explained. i'm not one who likes to have everything spoon-fed to me, and i like movies that leave things up to the audience to decide, but the parts that are left out from the toybox just seem like they either ran out of money before they could explain them or they didn't really think things through to begin with.i look forward to the director's next project, since i think there is a lot of talent lurking under the surface here, but i can't really recommend the toybox on its own merits.

i won't say the show is all bad, because there are some funny parts, like spencer, and a few random incidents. but other than that, let's face it, it's just another dry sitcom that kids are buying into.miranda cosgrove was cute and funny as megan on drake and josh. honestly, she is mediocre in icarly and is just not as funny as she tries to be. the actress who plays sam seems to be half-asleep most of the time, and her antics are so clich√©d that i would think of them. they're not funny, just annoying. and freddie is okay, but not that interesting.of course, the situations are unrealistic, but it's not all bad. some are bothersome, though. here are a few: 1. the girls are 14, and have a web show that gives away too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000(wtf), with little to no advertising, and they can still go on about their lives not being attacked by crazy people 2.their web show gets too much praise ($100,000 yearly to advertise sneakers, a free trip to japan, plain white ts performance, and so on). honestly, anyone over the age of 6 would not find their "comedy" entertaining.3. how is it that they are so "average", yet they own a three story loft, spencer does hardly anything and can still afford many basic luxuries, and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. all of the adults are idiots. all of them.5. no 5 foot high girl, no matter how obnoxious and tenacious, can take down trained cops, unless she's muscular. sam is skinny and petite.6. no one can fall down 9 stories in an elevator and live.7. kids can handle finding out about criminals better than cops.the show is stupid. really, it seems harmless, but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their elders, live alone in seattle when they're only 14 with an irresponsible moron, and give out personal information is just wrong.i'm disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. what happened to the cartoons when i was her age?

stop me if you hard this one before, some cheerleaders, their coach and a couple guys are trapped within a cabin in the woods when an unseen killer kills them off one by one. shame on me, after i totally wrote off jim wynorski after the horrid "busty cops" (it was a long time coming as his last truly good film was 1990's "hard to die"), i still for some reason got my hopes up for a supposed sequel to "slumber party massacre". sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met. this outing is not nearly as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise (and yes i'm including spm 2, that should tell you something) furthermore how can you have a slasher film with this little gore??? i mean come on now!! my grade: d eye candy: ricky ray gets topless; april flowers and charity rahmer show boobs and buns in a shower scene (april gets nude again later in the film), and tamie sheffield gets topless and bares buns

mad scientist professor tabani drinks a potion he has brewed up in his laboratory but is turned into a blood craving vampire instead.when dr.aqil pays a visit tabani sees a picture of aqil's wife shabnam and,after turning aqil into a vampire,heads for shabnam to make her his bride.aqil's brother discovers the grave of the vampire and his brother at tabani's castle and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul.tabani succeeds in putting the bite on shabnam and once turned she tries to lure her young niece away.aqil's brother races against time to put a stop to the vampire curse."zinda laash" almost put me to sleep.the plot is extremely slow but more or less follows bram stoker's famous novel.the suspense is completely absent as is the gore and nudity.the film is only recommended for curious horror fans that want to see the second horror film made in pakistan(after "madman" from 1964).

i normally finish every movie or book i start, even if they're poor, just 'cause i hate giving up on them. this was so poorly made, i was in disbelief.i'm not just looking for spielberg magic - i rent foreign films, and i rent really old sci-fi's (most recently soylent green - worth the rent). i like both hollywood action and slower moving character development. different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated. i could find no redeeming element to this one... the action was so wooden i wasn't the least bit on edge. the character development was virtually absent - you're not left feeling sorry for anyone, or even identifying with them. finally, there were so many pieces that just didn't add up.don't waste your time - better to watch paint dry...

if you read the plot summary for "mad max," you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film. you've also found out that "mad max" takes place in post-apocalyptic australia, which will be helpful because otherwise you won't have any idea what's going on. the film, made in 1979, tries really hard to be stanley kubrick's "a clockwork orange" (1971) only that film, in all its strangeness, actually makes sense and leaves an impact. this film does neither and ends up being a car/bike stunt-filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does.the first thing wrong with "mad max" is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes. if the first hour were condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that, "mad max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist. instead, mel gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 2/3 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge. i've yet to watch the sequel "road warrior" and i have to admit i'm excited for it only because i want to know what he does next. this first film was mostly a waste of time.george miller does some great action stuff here, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments. its a terribly clich√© b-movie technique.there is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think. a great action sci-fi movie at least makes a point, but the gratuitous violence done by random, weird bikers doesn't say anything of value. even the villain toecutter feels modeled off alex of "clockwork" only uglier and completely unimposing. the pg violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer, it just cheeses it up if anything.i'll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions. everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later. i'm just crossing my fingers "road warrior" will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends, otherwise that's more time wasted. ~steven cvisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com

i just have to comment on this movie because i gave it a 4 rating, and in my opinion that's pretty high for a softporn smut movie. the actual plot is kind of hokey (who would expect otherwise) but hafron is so incredibly funny, and he delivers everything in a cyborgish voice so it's easy for him. whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely! i must have laughed out loud ten times, and that's not a reason anyone would pick up this movie. the only softporn movie i've seen which had any merit other than beautiful women (and believe me, emmanuelle is drop dead gorgeous...just look at the cover!)any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is, also considering the movie wasn't made to artistically entertain, so to speak, it gets at least a four in my book. i mean, who wouldn't watch this before stop! or my mom will shoot?

okay, the only reason i watched this movie is because krista allen is in it. since i admit to watching days of our lives... i know her as billie. oh sure, perhaps there will be a reason to watch this movie.. that would be the soft porn area. they seem to exel at that. and little else. i would hope anyone renting/buying this movie rented it only for the sex scene's. because if they bought/rented it for anything else, say quality tv, they may die of a heart attack. this movie involves little imagination whatsoever. while i do have a good laugh at it's stupidity, and perhaps i'll buy it myself, i am but a fool. rent before you buy on this one. 2 out of 10. (note i have yet to give a movie a 1 star. the sensual scene's alone gave itself and up from a 1. if they hadn't a straight 1 in the pot and i want a refund if it hadn't.)

i caught this movie on late-night tv. honestly i saw most of it, and the whole time i was sitting in complete and utter disbelief.is there any genre that's more pointless than soft-core porn? if there is i don't want to know about it. softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn (lousy production values, abominable acting, crappy scripts) with the coyness of sex-scenes in regular movies. so the end result is arousing nor entertaining. this movie also has the rather odd approach of a science-fiction setting, and it works horribly. all the sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality setting where the crew from the future learn about physical love. and yes, it's about as confused and silly as it sounds.but there has to be some positive points though, right? well, there is one... krista allen is amazingly hot. that's about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie. i don't know what it is about her, but she has an amazing sex appeal. the rest of the cast look like the standard porn-cast though. rather unattractive women with poorly done fake breasts, and men that have spent far too much time in the gym toning themselves grotesque. probably a gym in germany as well judging by haircuts and clothing.to sum things up. if you enjoy krista allens presence on screen you can watch this for the brief moments where she shows some of her seductive potential (most of the time she tries to articulate crappy lines of dialog though). if you don't enjoy krista allen then you might as well stay away altogether.i rate this 10/10 for krista allens sex appeal, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value since this is a unique crappy porn/science fiction hybrid that's not really like anything i've ever seen.

this is not a new film. it is a re-cut of 1994's "emmanuelle, queen of the galaxy", and it has been significantly truncated. warning: many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie!if you want to see this one in its original form, pick up "queen" - avoid this one at all costs, as the cuts make it even choppier than it was originally.

i don't understand the people here. the film is neither as good as as bad as some people say here. except for de kok the acting is ok. the problem with the film is mainly the script. the characters are not believable. the sex is done okay, but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense. the film doesn't look good, but what do you expect? the film was shot for very little money on video. off course then it doesn't look as good as a normal film, duh! the one thing i do agree on is that the music is bad. sounds like a cheap soft erotic film from the '80's. the film is not good, okay, but you have to give some credit for pulling this of without any money.

well, this movie wasn't as horrible as i thought it would be. i was expecting to give it one star. i chose to give it three. why? well, for a cheesy horror/sci-fi movie, it's not all that bad. sure the characters are tacky (as is their acting - including a young leonardo dicaprio), the effects cheap looking, and the monsters...well let's just say that i've seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools... but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end. a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess. and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas, this movie will let you live your dream. 3/10

i didn't particularly like sliding doors or twice upon a yesterday, so i certainly didn't this poor second-rate excuse for those films. an idea that's been done to death (what would happen if...?) and the script is shoddy and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sex/nudity simply to gain an r rating and certain scenes that just weren't necessary but were there to push the boundaries (i really don't need to see a kid urinating or a struggle with a diaphragm. especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film).the acting was also very poor, the only actor i found the least bit satisfying was her daughter; the rest were two-dimensional and quite unbelievable. the people i watched this with left the room about halfway through; i managed to finish it, but not without fast forwarding through part of it.overall: nothing new here, it's a generic and boring film. the few rather amusing moments are far outweighed by the silly or stupid ones. this would be dull even if it hadn't been done before. if it weren't such a rehash i'd rate it a five, but even for an indie film this was severely lacking, and as a rehash it loses on originality as well: 3/10.

the main problem with 9th company (9 rota) is that it is not sure whether it wants to be saving private ryan or full metal jacket. the attempts at spielberg sentimentalism are embarrassing, such as the burley sergeant crying in a field of red flowers!!! the training sequences have none of intensity or realism that kubrick gave them in his masterpiece.a further bone of contention is that the afghan fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are hardly ever seen. here they attack a russian strong hold almost in formation with no attempt to use cover. i am sure tactics have move on since waterloo.every scene in this film has been seen before in other war movies and done considerably better. i have to ask: why do all talented marksmen need to chew on a match?finally, i am always suspicious of a film that starts with no narration yet needs to qualify the end."we won!" ...errrr....... no you didn't.

first, i'm sorry for my english. second, the true story of this episode: 39 soldiers, operation "magistral'". 6 soldiers were killed. hundreds of insurgents were killed too. within 10 years the soviet army has lost less than 15 thousand person and killed over 900000 insurgents and civilians. there is no insurgents without permanent help of usa the veteran of war: "traditions. there are no traditions in this film. there is no military oath, there is no first jump, no farewell to the fighting banner. there is no delivery of awards and medals. there is nothing sacred. there is only a hatred to soviet army. being in this area on investigation, we have revealed start-up jet shells by insurgents . an exact place could not define. so gunners have asked to give easier square. also have covered it. through pair minutes. here it was the reality of fights. so there was no feeling "oblivion". these feelings have appeared then. already on other war and in other state (chechnya). others were children. more kindly. more humanly. and "prapors" were as fathers. well and culmination fight - full orgy. shooting in anywhere. mental attacks young ben-ladens, not killed both not broken through. and full absence of mutual aid. that there was a main thing on this war. even americans accused us of inadequate application of force against insurgents. and here it is direct on the contrary. in the summer 1981 i about myself have firmly solved, that personally should fill up a minimum 50 insurgents. as a result accepted "plan" has been under-fulfilled, and on a demobilization i departed strongly contused and malicious as fig. after returning the first months there was a feeling of that i not was at war up to the end, not business there have completed all how follow. there was any vague, but an oppressive sensation of discontent with itself and caustic irritation. such here night ideas, can be and out of place at all. officers really in film are not present absolutely. in occasion of that, what is the time they spent with staff. on fighting-is constant. new year on fighting. from where did they take beds? in mountains? and so on..."if you want a fairy tale about war, "9 rota" and "shtrafbat" is for you. if you want truth, you must see "come and see" or "batallions ask for fire".

yes, it might be not historically accurate(actually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there), and yes, it has some mistakes and exaggeration(bended machine gun? come on! or the that "history lesson" about how afghanistan was never conquered by anyone - educated russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example british campaign in afghanistan). and yes, it does not have multi-million dollars hollywood-style special effects, but it's strongest point in showing soldier's life there, their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes. in my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all those things.again, movie has it weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few years.8/10

this movie was filmed in my hometown and i was acquainted with many of the "actors" in minor rolls. most of them were students at the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed we all knew what a stinker it was. it was interesting however to see it being made. most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist, such as the nightclub, the pizza shop, etc. the "world premiere" was held at the akron civic theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was. i personally believe it's the worst movie ever made but it brings back many fond memories for me. watch this movie with a word of advice...enjoy it for what it is..a very low budget, poorly made , karate flick.

i am speechless, honestly i cannot understand how anyone could have conceded to a script like this, cast anyone in the film let alone direct it. the fact that i am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown in to the dustbin rather than be reviewed. i am disappointed in flex alexander for even thinking about accepting such a poor excuse for a script let alone essay the role. omg! i think i just insulted the word "essay"...uh yeah i did. y'know what, the less said about this mindless drivel, the better. you have been warned, nobody warned me i had to experience the horror myself. watch at your own risk.

the main word that comes to mind when considering this film is "dodgy". this is a low-quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. the gloved one deserved better.before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic, i have to say that there are two things i found effective. first was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child molestation allegations. i feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was *severely* lacking throughout the rest of the film. second was the sequence depicting the courtship of michael jackson and lisa marie presley. i will not comment on whether i believe the marriage was a sham, but by many accounts, it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved. that really came across in this film; flex anderson and krista rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off. these successful points are enough to keep man in the mirror away from 1-star status.that said...there was very little else here that worked. very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, most egregiously those playing elizabeth taylor, janet jackson, and diana ross. also, the absence of jackson's music was a huge loss. how can you effectively tell a story about him without his music?? i understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low-budget, unauthorized production; it seems, though, that if you can't have the man's music in a film about him, you might as well pack it up and go home, because you're missing out on an extremely important part of his life story.this film's characterization of jackson bothered me a little, too. i won't argue that he was troubled and may have been a few fries short of a value meal, but here, he was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled. i don't believe that jackson, known to have been a shrewd businessman, would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as he was made out to be in this film.finally, the way this film was written was nothing short of disgraceful. many lines or exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny, like michael and janet's "tinkerbell" exchange, or nonsensical, like the "blanket of love" comments made by michael. also, the screenwriters don't exactly have a knack for subtlety. there was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events ("what could possibly go wrong??" sorts of lines) and extremely overt hammering of themes and motifs in the film (if i'd heard the word "believe" one more time...). this is what ultimately hobbled the film as something that could be considered awesomely bad.perhaps when we are a few years, or even a decade or three, removed from jackson's death, someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserving film. by that time, we might have a better perspective on his life, and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful examination of who michael jackson really was and what he's meant to the world of entertainment. this very dodgy biopic was not that film.

usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity, its, at the very least, campy (i.e. cybill shepherd as martha stewart, lauren bacall as doris duke), this is the most horrendous, cheap, and boring television movie ever made. if vh-1 is going to make a television film, they have got to spend a little more money on them. flex alexander--though gifted with the michael voice--is not a great dancer, does not resemble michael one bit, and does not even have his mannerisms down. vh-1 would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator, that way when see michael go into get plastic surgery, he doesn't actually come out looking exactly the same. why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film? the woman playing elizabeth taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her, and don't even get me started on the woman as janet jackson. terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep vh-1 from producing any more movies. flex alexander would have made a much better jermaine jackson rather than michael. costumes? trashy ripoffs. neverland? spliced together footage from news docs. don't bother with this one....its not even remotely worth it. the one good piece of casting--the actor portraying joseph jackson and maybe the actress as lisa marie presley, though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl.

i grabbed la bandara because it reunited jean gabin and julien duvivier, whose pepe le moko is a noir masterpiece. i'll give it a few points because gabin is in it, but the clumsy plot, cheap sets and the ludicrous annabella making like an arab princess put the film on my `to sell' shelf. if you watch it, you'll find yourself asking, why didn't the idiots build the fort *around* the well, instead of a deadly few yards away from it. and why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? but by then the sheer perversity of contrivance that makes up the script should numb you to any further contemplation.

not many people outside poland have had an opportunity to become familiar with andrzej sapkowski's brilliant writings. he's very popular in poland for his fantasy short stories ( i believe none of them has ever been translated intrto english. alas!). to make a long story short, wiedzmin - the main character of sapkowski's books - is a traveling monster slayer, a man of extraordinary strenght and skill: he's pretty much your favourite tolkien-style cool guy. unfortunately, no one would figure this out after watching the film. 'wiedzmin' the movie is nothing but a collection of random scenes, featuring wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but not eben remotely resembling the plot and dramatic pace of the original. event the fact that some of the shots in the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it. the movie gets worse and worse with every minute, and does not even meet the requirements of 'so bad it's actually good' category. if you really are into fantasdy and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books instead.

yes, that's true. that movie is a horrible piece of... you know what. almost all fans of sapkowski's books in poland think the same. the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films. it's a shame when you compare "wiedzmin" and "conan the barbarian" for example. i hope no one outside poland will ever see this nightmare.

a very mediocre film based on a superb series of stories and novels. i hope somebody, someday will be able to film it the right way. in the meantime, look for the books (by a. sapkowski), a very inteligent, postmodern fantasy. by now there should be a translation in english, there translations in german for sure.

there are three main problems with the film. or rather there are three reasons why it isn't even a contender worthy of more serious consideration.firstly, and this was always going to be true, it's not nearly as good as the books. however, at least we could have expected to reflect some of the sapkowski's wit or depth.secondly we have the production. fantasy movies are, in my opinion, the hardest to produce well. everything from the props through costumes, scenery, stunts and (especially) cgi is substandard.finally, and this is many be very subjective, i just can't quite take the acting seriously. i wasn't brought up in poland so i can't really judge- it may me my lack of familiarity with films in polish. all the same the lines seem very amateurishly delivered... the casting could be better as well.in summation, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through: not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting cadaver.on a separate note i heard that the books are coming out in english. i haven't seen them yet but i can't imagine how one would even begin to translate them... i would ask the english-speaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book.

brodzki's creation is a great example of how not to make a movie. first there was a book written with a great humor. book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place. then came a script as humorless and full of nonsense as possible. at the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually had read the books to understand anything of the plot. not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway(ex. "i'm like an ice shard. you can burn yourself" said yennefer as a word of warning - warning that logic is something this movie seriously lacks). to add to that we have to mention that no matter the amount of money that was supposedly spent on the movie everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects one of which is a see-through dragon. even the costumes look as if the were borrowed from a really poor theater. that is the better ones look this way. and to add to that we have a few 'naked scenes' put there only so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what one may mercifully call plot. the movie has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest - music is not bad. though if i was to choose i'd prefer to have it separately. it sounds better if you don't have to look at this failure of super production.

the movie is simply horrible (2/10). although actors are trying their best (well sometimes that isn't much) special effects are ...let me put it this way it would be better if there weren't any.the script is based on sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. sadly it's the opposite. there is nothing left of the original atmosphere. and it's all very chaotic. maybe they just had too much material to show in 2h time.anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series (same title, same actors, even the plot stays the same) that was made in the same time the movie did. it is so much better (9/10) and the story there actually make sense:)

well, for a start, i must say that, here, in russia, a saga of geralt of rivia is known and loved. andrzej sapkowski - a gifted writer, or, maybe, even genius of some sort - created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and god d@mn well written fantasy worlds in a history of literature. and when such amazing material gets in a right hands well, see rpg game "witcher" and you will understand what i am talking about."vedmak\wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite outcome.lack of budget. lack of directing. lack of good script.these three whales of disgusting movie making sunken this movie, ate it alive. acting is good, sometimes even more than good but for god sake it can not save this project. i still have some faith though. i still hope that someday a new vedmak movies will be created and entire world will see magnitude and breathtaking splendor of sapkowski's books. p.s. but before that a uwe boll must be eliminated. just in case, you know

when just days away before the film's premiere, its screenwriter backs out of the project, and demands his name to be removed from the credits, you know that this does not bode well. the books, on which "wiedzmin" is based on, have great potential for a vivacious fantasy film ¬ñ "geralt de rivia is a witcher; his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world. but not everything monstrous-looking is evil, and not everything fair is good¬Ö" but all that didn't matter, when a polish film crew, with a low budget, and no, or little appreciation for sapkowski's work, decided to make a 13-part mini-series out of it. the two-hour film is a by-product of their actions, to maximize the profits. it's not hard to point out in this case, what makes people label this film as bad. plot (incoherent, thanks to cramming it with too many stories), acting (below average, with exception of zebrowski), dialogues (bland), editing (choppy), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor), add up to the film's overall bad experience. only the soundtrack, done by grzegorz ciechowski, brings out the beauty of the world of "wiedzmin", which was never brought to the screen. even poland's grandiose flora and fauna (where part of "the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe" was shot), a crucial element in almost any fantasy film, were not used up to their full potential. the more i think about this dead loss, the more i'm running out of words. at least, it's a comfort to know, that marek brodzki, the director of "wiedzmin", has directed only one film ever since (in addition, in germany). for now, we're left with top-notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer rpg (released in 2007) referring to the wiedzmin books. but i'm sure that one day, justice will be done for the wiedzmin saga, and we'll be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough.

this movie is trash from the word go. first, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago! who cares? this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap. it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character.swearing doesn't bother me, but i'm still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel. the f-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break.this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed. i rate this on the same level as jaws iv - the revenge and everybody wins...2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame.

this movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "let's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era! and let's cast brian dennehey as coach bobby knight!" that's where this movie went terribly wrong. why cast an actor who bears no semblance of the man he's portraying? and then, why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight, but brian dennehey in a red sweater? as i sat watching this movie on espn, i didn't find myself believing this man was actually coach knight. he didn't look like him, talk like him, act like him, or even walk like him. i could not get past this fact, and thusly, i could not enjoy the movie. when paul newman and robert redford were cast as the outlaws butch cassidy and the sundance kid, we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until we saw the movie. but, with someone as visible in today's media as coach knight, you have to do better. when anthony hopkins was cast as nixon, it was the same situation. but, anthony hopkins made us believe he in fact was nixon. dennehey didn't even try. what might have been a great movie was turned sour by this. besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the four-letter word what "saving private ryan" did for dismemberment, it stunk. too little of the real coach knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this movie into a "season to turn off half-way through the broadcast." the only good thing about this is that it was television movie. i didn't have to waste my hard-earned money on this piece of trash.

i watched this with great trepidation, and my trepidation was well founded, it seems. what was this movie about? knight? the season? the players? what? it was all over the place all the time. it had no tension (sorry, we all knew bobby was going to curse and throw things) but brian denehy, a fine actor, comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension. cheaply shot, like a macgiver episode. contrast this thanksgiving main course with the job hbo did on the don king movie "only in america" to show how to do sports biopics, warts and all. notice that espn promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again?

its obvious espn drools whenever knight is in the news, but did they have to make a freakin' movie about him? this was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie i have ever seen. it had it all: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc etc. it looked like it was shot on a $10 budget. cummon, whats up with the game scenes? were they in a middle school gym? and the lighting, well, let me just say it was ridiculous. and brian denehy as bob knight? give me a break. denehey looked like...denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. espn lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. they poured millions of $$$ in advertising, then the premier was a huge dissapointment. bob knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. espn blew it. even knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.

"season on the brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful unflinching look at bob knight and his indiana hoosiers. and dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. so i made a point of watching this adaptation.it disappointed on every level. dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play knight - like he had accepted the role just prior to filming. the rest of the cast isn't much better.and it was obvious that this was espn's first movie. it was poorly directed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.) skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well to this day!

despite the famous cast this animated version of dickens tale is the borest i've seen. enough that i zapped away in he first commercial break. the characters didn't appeal to me at all and the animation is looking cheap.i'll give this movie a very low rating. give me the disney version anytime.

why wasn't this voted for best picture of 1998? this has to be the best movie ever. it makes something like citzen kane look like utter crap, come on, citzen kane wasn't even in color! i love this movie, it has to be the best movie i've ever put money down on. i am still shocked that it wasn't nominated for anything! if 10 is the highest you can give it, i give it 20!

i didn't really get this movie because i'm not some perv like you, who is into lesbian stuff.the girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny (her lips are so silicone!), but she's really lame and insecure. she tries to come off like a surfer-guy (better than dressing slutty, but still weird and definitely unfashionable); the movie doesn't explain why she's trying to pass herself off as a man. oh, right, to "get" the poor, dumb girl. i forgot. she makes all these dumb inventions which are not funny, and she's a really lousy actress. plus, that waif look is so out!this dumb blond girl from melrose place plays(surprise) a dumb blond.she thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! they even make out! ewww! i guess that part was sort of funny.

there is a reason chairman of the board got a 2, (which is too high) this movie flat out is one of the worse movies of all time and i seen my share of rotten films. chairman of the board stars two of the most annoying actors/people today, carrot top and courtney thorne smith. carrot top just isn't funny anymore and wasn't in this piece of trash. courtney thorne smith isn't any better, just watch "according to jim" and you will see a prime example of what i am talking about. chairman of the board got a 1 from me, because that is low as you can go it is that bad. i am a little shocked that this piece of junk isn't on the imdb bottom 100 somewhere, i would put this in the top 5 on that list, but its slowly working its way there.

before i sat down and watched this film on hbo, i wasn't expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot. well, that's exactly what i got out of it, except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie. i wasn't expecting it to be, i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste. well, it was, but still it was somewhat worth it. the whole plot was very stupid, cheap acting, and some of the lines were very very dumb. otherwise than that, it still had it's funny moments, even though not many.all in all, if you're going to rent this, don't. watch it on television. i gave it a 4, i was generous because it made me laugh, but yet it was still pretty stupid.

carrot top in a full length movie, enough said. only reason this doesn't get a one is through my personal voting system of only one 1 and one 10, and this is no extreme ops. horrible god awful. there are some movies that are so bad they are unintentionally funny, then there are movies that make you physically unwell and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide. burn all copies of the movie, shoot anyone who had non creative input on this movie, torture anyone with any creative input and as for the star, there are only so many things that can be said online, but he should be begging for the final ten seconds of existence with a severed head by the time the work is done.

this movies shook my will to live why this abomination isn't the bottom 100 list i don't know.my life was saved by the healing power of danny trejo.worst movie ever, i dare you watch. it's like a 90 minute collect calling commercial, only much much worse. i rather watch the blue screen it's that bad really

people don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. the same type of people that see a movie with carrot top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. is carrot top funny? of course not. was this movie anything special? of course not. it was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about mr. top. movies like this, or kazaam, or killer klowns from outer space and pretty much any movie pauly shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. you watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think carrot top is hilarious.please people if you ready know carrot top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.

this is what they came up with for prop comedian carrot top's first feature film.a stupid surfer (carrot dude) inherits an r&d enterprise from an old kahuna (jack warden). things go less than swimmingly, but get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt corporate raiders. the most implausible thing about this movie is that smart-girl courtney thorne-smith would find this red-headed step-child fascinating in the least (but then, he just inherited millions). 'classic' moments include comic larry miller drinking sweat from a plastic cup.funny comedy? try un-funny toilet humor, and that's exactly where this belongs - in the toilet... flush twice.

is this a bad movie? don't take my word for it. consider the following press reports of people who tried to watch this movie: ¬∑ while he was watching this movie, the brain of mr. harold faber of sandusky, ohio, forcibly ejected itself from his skull at over 200 kph and preceded to squirm across the floor shrieking noooo nooo noooo.¬∑ mrs. louise robbins of enid, oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired homemaker, committed ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this movie.¬∑ ms. janine hosmer of columbia, south carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this movie, although she had not been pregnant.¬∑ while watching this movie together, mr. and mrs. lawrence wells of san franciso, california, spontaneously exploded with such force that mr. wells's left tibia was later found embedded in the wall of a house in marin county.there have been many similar incidents.of those who did not suffers more serious effects such as those detailed above, at least 75% became incurably, violently, and understandably insane after viewing this movie. of the remaining 25%, most had already been insane before viewing the movie; the remainder were either blind and/or and deaf or in a persistent vegetative state.i'm not saying don't rent it, if you want to. i'm just reporting what was in the papers.

or at least forceable retirement! this movie is awful, horrible, terrible, rank, rotten, putrid... well, you get the idea. do not under any circumstances watch this piece of decaying garbage unless you have a death wish, because it's sure to kill you. (i only survived because i missed the first half hour.) carrot top is a bad comedian, and an even worse actor. i cannot believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money. it just goes to show that some people have no scruples if they think they might make a buck or two (literally... i can't imagine this made more than $2!).and someone please tell me what possible motivation courtney thorne smith (a halfway decent actress, certainly above this at any rate) had for signing onto this steaming pile of dung. was she that bored during that 3.5 second dry spell between melrose place and ally mcbeal? or did she owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet (aka carrot top)?i give this a 2/10, and that's probably way too high. i try to save my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since i didn't see all of this one my stomach contents thankfully stayed contained. i don't think i'll be watching it again to find out if it's really worth a 1!

carrot top's "chairman of the board" and his at&t commercials are living proof that fly-blown fecal matter is available in the color orange. not freely available, however, as hbo charges for such garbage. blehhh! the saving grace of cotb is that it surely fills suicide hot-lines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited, although (sadly) carrot top probably contributes to his sponsor at&t's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated hbo viewers. i can visualize the hordes of traumatized tv viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of last-minute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of cotb's orange-haired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.

mr seagal has apparantly lowered his (already low) standards even more and has now outdone himself in making bad movies. the foreigner has no substance what so ever in the script. it's director has made an even worse job and the music and score is so cheezy and malplaced that you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. already 10 minutes into the movie, you just want to turn it off. however, considering steven seagal's past movies, you think 'hey, there might be some cool action-sequences at least worth watching...' ...you are wrong! it only gets worse as the movie progresses. everyone (with a few exceptions) seem to kill every person that they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. the only good thing with the movie is that it that it has an end and that it has a rather short running time. summing the movie up in two words: stay away!

the rap, the book this movie was 'based' on was one of the most difficult books i've ever read. yet i could not put it down. raunchy, crude, foul, lewd...you name it, it had it. it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel i've ever read.well, as for the flick...it was deplorable. i mean, tim mcintire as wasco? wasco was the baddest mutha...talking 'bout wasco...mcintire as wasco is like casting tim conway as charles manson.what happened to the main character in the book? little arv. he doesn't even exist in the movie...fast walking was not the main dude in the book. why even name credit this thing with the rap? none of the spirit, atmosphere, nastiness, or drama of the book was captured in this movie.for me it was not only a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.

i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. the gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like dillinger. seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties. there is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. the most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where ma barker and her sons are shooting it out with the fbi and the sons are killed. the narrator says something like " perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, ma barker became a real mother". this is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. a very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.

apparently re-cut episodes from the gangbusters tv show on the big screen. while this was frequently done in the 50's and 60's because people didn't have a tv or a color tv and producers wanted an increased return on their investment (big screen ticket sales or if it went to the small screen resale of a series that isn't in syndication), the results were usually less then the sum of their parts. the only time i've ever seen it work were where multi-part stories were put together (ala rocky jones or man from uncle) or in the case of horror anthology (the veil and 13 demon street). here the effect is to have stories of american criminals in the 20's and 30's (dillinger, pretty boy floyd, bonnie and clyde, etc)inter-cut with each other as a narrator talks about how the fbi hunted them down. its a weird concoction that doesn't quite work because its clear that there are things here that don't belong together. more than once i looked at the tv oddly because things didn't seem right. in fairness i won't describe the cheapness of the production since this was what early tv (and the series) was like. its not bad, but its not very good either. to be perfectly honest the episodes of the series that i've seen work better a single episodes where we're not expecting as much. given the choice i'd rent dvds of the show instead of this movie.

i caught a screening of this at the true/false documentary film festival in columbia, missouri, and i was pretty disappointed. i was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the rnc, but what i got was a largely flawed, bad-acted, fictitious, conspiracy ridden badly woven tale. i'd heard of its neo-documentary technique, "blending both true and false" but i expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews, but it was more along the lines of a terrible made-for-conspiracy theory tv movie.the acting overall is terrible except for rossario, which is not surprising considering the director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training, his excuse being that he wanted them to be real. heres a hint, real people can't act, but actors can usually act real.it would of been not so cornily offensive if it wasn't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie, its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. the movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role, it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big 'good' or 'evil' on every character.skip it, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary/

i know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. but the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open america's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government, and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. but somehow the documentary aspect of it, takes away from its drama. the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's.it would have been better to stick to a drama format. perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy.

like another reviewer, i really wanted to like this movie. i went with my father who was the biggest lover and booster of classical music but neither of us could stand this movie. i wouldn't even call it a movie. a better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces. as i recall, the camera never even moved. rather, i just sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece. the only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little wavelets lapping at a beach. i'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few inches high at some nearby lake, and again using a stationary camera. truly pathetic. i can't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five. when we walked out, my father and i were completely mystified as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie. i don't know of of any good movies about bach. the world really does need one, but just because it doesn't exist is not a reason to see this one. someone will make one someday. until then just keep rewatching _amadeus_.

"dogmatic," as another reviewer described this film, is a fitting word. the director's idea was to present bach without plot, acting, fun, theatrics, dialog, narrative, or drama. mission accomplished, monsieur straub. "pretentious?" yes. "cinematic?" no way. this is anti-cinema. no one moves. hardly anyone talks. the camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: very very occasionally the camera will dolly in. you may catch a glimpse of gustav leonhardt's fingers moving over the keys. that's it.if you like the idea of staring at the back of a harpsichordist's (bewigged) head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to bach, this is the film for you. i'd rather listen to bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.

pdq bach did it better. much of "bach"'s speaking part is letters written to various patrons complaining about the amount and speed of his payment. anna magdalena's diary, mostly about the death of children and sundry other family matters, is an iota more engaging. the music is disconcerting: 17th century sized chapel orchestras and choirs producing 20th century concert hall sound. the overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show. j s bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. this film adds nothing. netflix sent me 2 discs that wouldn't play, so i streamed the movie. clearly netflix was trying to tell me something.

utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process. while it is true that the sat's is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college, what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewing.college admissions officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process. the film is an insult to hard-working high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have applied for. this movie certainly deserves rejection on all levels.

sure this movie may have had its funny moments with the sat question people and i know the movie is not supposed to be totally believable the movie made it too outrageous for example a girl like that would never in a million years go out wit ha guy like that also people in movie had lackluster performances there acting was so bad. also the plot bad they could have don e a better job on the scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and got really boring after the first few jokes, it was like 10mins was laughter then the old when is this gonna end started to kick in the bottom line if u want a a lackluster of acting mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie.

dooley and his canine partner, jerry lee are together again in this 2nd sequel (?!!?) i sincerely had no clue that they made one sequel let alone two. and for a film that was only slight better than "turner & hooch"? this time after dooley retires, he has to mate his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait around for jerry lee to poo. real classy stuff. i mean come on now. the original had at least a few good laugh. this one has nary a one. jim belushi just looks old and worn out. both belushi brothers were great in the '80's. if john hadn't died, would he be so bad today like his brother? that thought makes me sad for some reason.my grade: d- where i saw it: usa network

not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires, touching our favorite trash/cult genre is nice. unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards. seem the creator's intention to make it cult it failed. trash movies are trash movies because it happens. you cant create in purpose this kind of films.i don't know if mr creepo is a legend (first time i heard his name) but if he is i wonder the reason...awful. even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic x-ploitation films will not be satisfied, as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires.

the emergence of quentin tarantino and his dubious influence on the likes of guy ritchie may have triggered the wave of appalling british gangster flicks we've been bequeathed over the past few years, but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this. i only wish he'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs. it's not only stifling his talent, but possibly the promise of future originality from british films. not one of this film's characters are likeable or even remotely realistic, and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and colourful language. caine doesn't give the material any more effort than it deserves, either. if this was meant to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la "king lear", it would've helped immensely had i cared about the ultimate fate of the principals, instead of just wishing that they'd get mired in the quicksand of life and dragged under almost immediately.

michael caine might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole storyline and character's around him where not likable or interesting at all. it was all very boring and somewhat predictable. martin landau , a favorite actor of mine had a nothing role.he was useless. michael caine got a bit irritating after a while and the film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. caine tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and storyline let him down. don't waste your time. it starts off well for the first 10 minutes and then that's about it. a film for die hard caine fans only. stay away from this one...

a vehicle for michael caine. its fairly well written and there's some ok acting in it but, really, it's a mess - not funny enough, not frightening enough. it's a flaccid modern cockney thriller.i like the premise - that even in the refracted moral hinterland of east london people do do things for the right reasons. a surprise result to the first proper fight caine's old-school billy shiner has promoted inflames his paranoia. the second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first.my greatest disappointment was in director john irvin's failure to make more of the relationship between shiner and his lieutenant/filial substitute frank harper. harper's, a british tom sizemore, understands his role well whilst those around him seem to have ignored it. pity. 4/10

on paper this looks a good film . michael caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter who's son is up for a title eliminator . the pity is that when the story is transferred from paper to my television screen it loses a certain everything . i had hoped we'd be seen emulating his definitive role in get carter and as the film progresses it does seem to take on the qualities of a tough gritty revenge thriller but the whole tone of the film jumps around so much you'll be confused as to what genre it's trying to fit in to . for example caine ( who you can't believe in as billy " shiner " simpson , he's simply michael caine ) has a laugh out line as he refers to someone as " hattie jacques " then in a supposedly humorous moment has his henchmen break someone's arm . oh how i laughed . i mean it's supposed to elicit a laugh the way it plays out on screen isn't it ? but these seems at odds with the way the rest of the film plays out obviously director john irvin doesn't know what approach to take with scott cherry's screenplay . irvin isn't a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as the dogs of war and hamburger hill but he's ill suited to this type of violent drama and one can't help but feel he might have been intimidated somewhat by a living legend like caine . caine does give the impression he's just doing it for the money and the well known faces in supporting roles like landua and cranham are basically just cameos who could be played by anyone

first off, this movie leaves you in a limbo mood wise. you don't know what to feel. so much so that you don't feel bad for caines character when his son gets murdered (which was actually mostly due to bad editing). the script was too bland. none of the situations matter as you watch them. the soundtrack, or lack there of (if there was it wasn't good enough to even remember) does not help it one bit. only good surprise to this movie was andy serkis' performance. it was on par if not better than caine's. the story would have probably gone better off if serkis would have killed him. because quite frankly you don't feel any kind of redemption in the climax. just a feeling of lack of feeling, if ya feel me. basically this movie massively lacks draw. leaving the audience alienated throughout the entire thing.

as a true lover of film i must advise you to avoid this appalling effort,, god knows how funding was approved, seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and plods along until nothing happens again and again and again ,, the only connectivity is two scares which at least keep you awake possiby the worst film i have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is bordering on criminal intent. one blessing with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on 12x and it will only last 25 minutes, ,, and you won't miss any of the plotno idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks !

ok, we got jp from grandma's boy and chuck from, well chuck. i thought this movie would be quite good based on the reviews, and it did start out pretty high on my movie scale, but about halfway through it was just dragging out for so long i kept losing interest. i actually got so bored, probably because you can see right away what's going to happen in the end; the story is actually quite thread-bare, i skipped over 15 minutes and didn't miss a thing! this film should have been a short work, maybe around 45 minutes to an hour max. it starts out good and finishes good, too bad the filling is bland, boring, dull, and lacks everything but time. some people say they like it for the music; i don't care for jazz and i don't go see movies for their score, i go for the story and when that's drawn out... well, ratings drop in my book.bottom line: good open, great close, boring filler. story was cool, but if you don't know what's going to happen a quarter of the way through, you haven't seen too many thrillers.

decent but overrated dramatic thriller, film attempts to depict the spiraling out-of-control inner demons of a tormented artist. the problem is, not a single relationship illustrated on screen is believable, and plausibility appears to have been thrown out the window. the title character is so difficult to relate to making it's rather impossible to imagine any of the on- screen characters emotionally invested in him either. the conclusion is also fairly predictable; there are certainly enough clues provided from the get go to indicate exactly where the story is headed. choosing to entirely suspend one's belief in the situations or the relationships, the film itself is well acted (especially by the leads) and manages to create some nice tension as the story unfolds. as a metaphorical feature there is some food for thought, and had the script been stronger, there's certainly potential here that could have been put to better use.

in order to describe what's seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some *spoilers* so if you're going to see it and expect to be surprised, don't read this!i liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential. it is well acted, if a bit slow moving, and the camera work and portland scenes are exquisite for a low-budget, unpretentious picture. the dialog is very good. mason is seriously withdrawn youth who works at a telemarketing company selling insurance. his high school buddy, berkeley, is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that mason is quite obviously mentally ill. mason has nightmares which send him gasping and fumbling for his inhaler. his visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with good-looking women in his past, and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women. he meets a perky, pretty girl named amber and he sketches her in his notebook. she takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait. he sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state, almost becoming halfway human. then something goes wrong. amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. she becomes frightened and pulls away. we are wondering if her sudden coldness is going to push him over the edge. his behavior becomes more erratic. this is the setup for the revelation. in order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong i have to explain what happens. *another spoiler warning!* in order for this plot to work we have believe that amber, a really outgoing, pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has a vacant stare and can only speak in monosyllables or doesn't speak at all. he's way beyond nerdy, he appears on the verge of total catatonia. yes i know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos, but usually the charles manson type or punk rockers, guys with some kind of evil manic energy. mason is practically a zombie, he's hardly there at all. any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him. it is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him. moreover there is no credible reason for berkeley to indulge the crazy mason, that just isn't believable either. but wait, there's a revelation. amber fails to show up at berkeley's house for christmas dinner where mason is expecting her and berkeley, his old buddy, has to tell him that amber and all his other former girlfriends, the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks, don't exist at all! she and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination: he dreamed them up. well, this explains why a normal cute amber would go for mason, she's just a figment of his imagination. this could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup, but alas, it's not. at this point mason runs back to his apartment and finds amber there...he's enraged, he kills her. but now we are given to understand that amber was in fact real, not mason's imaginary girlfriend. in the end, after being given proof that amber actually exists and that mason killed her, berkeley has to admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged mason. this would work if mason had been halfway sane from the beginning, but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us. we suspected what he was all along and can't understand why berkeley couldn't see it. but then we are once again left to wonder: if she was real, why amber would be attracted to the catatonic mason? to make the ending worse, we are never given to understand whether all the other of mason's girlfriends, the ones in the sketchbooks, were real or was amber the first real one? and if the others were real, did he kill them too? what did he do with the bodies? the problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material. perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible suspense story, but this movie is not that.

i approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. i sat down to watch it with this mindset, and was pleasantly surprised.it's not great. it's not even that good; in fact, it's pretty poor. however, it's not as bad as i had been led to believe, by a long shot. it's pretty inept, and, evidently as a cost cutting measure, a lot of stock footage is pressed into service, a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative.what it is, however, is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. before you discount _glen or glenda?_ out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. me, i'd love to be able to draw, but anything i try to sketch comes out like stick men. i'd love to be able to sing, but all i do is frighten young children.wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work. however, this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s, however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance.

first of all, ed wood jr. is not the worst director ever, plan 9 from outer space not withstanding. coleman francis deserves that title. i present exhibit b, glen or glenda.the first half of the movie consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of crossdressing, especially since it was made in 1953. the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.this is not to say the movie doesn't have problems. bela lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines. poor bela looked like even he wasn't sure what was happening at times. the acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period universal b movie. the long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre; more like a vaguely menacing stag film than a dream sequence. the alan/ann story, the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it.no, ed wood jr. is not the worst director ever. he was able, at least for part of this movie, to make an earnest social statement. when coleman francis tried to do that in night train to mundo fine (aka red zone cuba), it just ended in chaos. glen or glenda is at least watchable without robot help.

bela lugosi as god? transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight-laced 1950s? by golly, this must be an ed wood film.watching this movie, i felt a combination of guilt, pleasure, and nausea all at the same time. the story is about glen (ed wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter-ego glenda. somehow, if this movie were made now, i could see kevin kline playing glen/glenda. notice how all the cross-dressers' alter egos are versions of their male name (glen/glenda, robert/roberta, etc.). it attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is, rather than as a graphic perversion. somehow, wood manages to sneak in bondage and s&m sequences into his initial story of glen/glenda. along with these racy scenes, satan himself shows up, obviously having a bad hair day. the dialog and pace are nonexistent, but the film is enjoyable in its context -- the weird world of ed wood.sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one.

there's a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very courageous movie about transvestites, tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically (and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and trying very hard not to stereotype. the movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals, and that aside from wearing women's clothing they lead a relatively normal life. it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society - the plot revolves around a police officer (lyle talbot) desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite. so, you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial (in the context of 1953) subject.having said all that, i'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful. in trying to portray glen/glenda's (edward d. wood) pain, the movie falls into silly (and at times surprisingly - again given the era - sensual) fantasies that make the story very hard to follow. the acting is wooden at best. none of the dialogue comes across as real; the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others. and - worst of all - there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie. this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career. "pull the strings; pull the strings," poor lugosi's character (called the spirit in the credits, but really coming across as more of a mad scientist) kept crying. and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie.for artistic merit, the movie doesn't really deserve much more than 1/10. however, for the courage involved in just putting it out, i'll give it a 3/10.

like other movies from the worst director ever, ed wood, this movie is very bad but because of that it is also very funny. may be not for everyone, but i laughed a lot. it is a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. how do you rate it? as a movie very low, as entertainment at least a little higher.the movie tries to explain what a transvestite is and it does this through a scientist (bela lugosi) and an inspector (lyle talbot) who talks to a doctor (timothy farrell) who knows about these things. the doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we, and apparently the scientist, see. the doctor tels these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide, and because of a headline in the news paper about a sex-change. the first and longest story is about glen (ed wood himself) who is in love and about to marry barbara (dolores fuller) but he has never told her he like to dress as a woman, when he is named glenda. the movie tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. the movie almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being homosexual is, since it keeps telling us the fact that a transvestite is not a homosexual. the second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex-change and not just wants to dress up as a woman, but it is much shorter and less interesting.a couple of things make this movie very bad, and therefore laughable. how the story is presented is the first thing, the way the same things are told over and over again and the conclusion of it all are others. this is not where it ends. the acting is very bad, especially dolores fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a little screen somewhere. every thing she says is funny. the whole dialogue actually gave me quite some laughs.there is also a sequence where someone walks into a room. the door stays half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. then the door, in what seems to be the same shot although we know it is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight. ed wood didn't mind to leave this kind of continuity errors in his movie. may be a good thing, because basically it is just another laugh for the modern audience. i think you understand that it is a bad movie and i think there is a good chance you will laugh at the ridiculous mistakes as well.

as many know, this is the feature film debut of edward d. wood jr. as as a writer/producer/director/actor. i have been a fan of ed wood for several years now. while i don't like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of wood during his life. everybody knows that he was a transvestite. this film is about changing one's sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. this film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it. however, the film still contains wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialog, meaningless stock footage, and hokey special effects. throw in wood's usual overdose of bela lugosi hamming it up and you have wood's first attempt at being a director.the plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines. the doctor tells him the story of glen, who is also a transvestite. glen wants to marry barbara, but can't bring himself to tell her about his secret. he also tells the inspector about alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman. bela lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on (lugosi's part really isn't well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for wood to have a star in his film and lugosi to get some cash).all in all, the movie shows the hallmarks of wood's career. it was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly. it definitely has the "it's so bad, it's good" feel to it. however, i do have to applaud ed on his progressive thinking in making this film. transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s. wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on cross-dressing.

i just recently watched ed wood jr.'s autobiographical movie glen or glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years. nothing i had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what i saw. this has to be the most bizarre movie ever made. stampeding buffalo, women in bondage, satan prancing around and bela lugosi, rambling only as he can, "bevare, bevare....pull the string, pull the string...", it was totally insane. the acting was atrocious and the dialog was unintentionally hilarious, exactly what one would expect from an ed wood film. having said all that, as horrible as this movie was, i have to give wood credit...he was way ahead of his time. you have to remember that when this movie was made transvestites were not even discussed in public, much less the subject for a movie. i have read that wood was a transvestite in real life, and i'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. it was sad to see bela lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film, but it was kind of ed wood jr. to at least give mr. lugosi an acting job at a time in bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in hollywood would hire him. if you have never seen this film then you have to see it, especially if you are a fan of ed wood jr.

directed and written by the famous/infamous edward d. wood jr, using a pseudonym(daniel davis)playing the lead role of glen/glenda. this is an almost radical documentary about transvestism; wood himself being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters. it seems miles of stock footage and an incoherent bela lugosi is used to stretch this odd and awkward film to 67 minutes. police inspector(lyle talbot)seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist, dr. alton(timothy farrell), to better understand the emotional and disposition of transvestites.also in the cast: delores fuller, "tommy" hanes, captain dezita and wood's sister evelyn. of note: farrell also acts as narrator. and fuller later helped write songs included in the elvis presley movies blue hawaii, kissin' cousins & kid galahad.

considering the film‚Äôs reputation as truly the worst of the worst, i was looking forward to watching wood‚Äôs crappus opus (my word); it‚Äôs not necessarily any more inept than the other woods i‚Äôve watched ‚Äì however, being from the reefer madness (1938) school of film-making, glen or glenda doesn‚Äôt come across as readily ‚Äòenjoyable‚Äô as his genre efforts.also, this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosi‚Äôs nadir (his first of three ‚Äòcollaborations‚Äô with the director): one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was (considering the actor‚Äôs history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo). besides, lugosi‚Äôs idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here‚Ä¶though wood‚Äôs script is mostly to blame for this ‚Äì given the impossible dialogue (with repeated nonsensical allusions to ‚Äúpuppy-dog tails‚Äù and ‚Äúbig fat snails‚Äù) he handed the ailing star! by the way, wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym daniel davis) ‚Äì and, being just as worthless in this area, proves to have been an all-round dog!; dolores fuller ‚Äì his wife and co-star ‚Äì was similarly untalented (she would also appear in jail bait [1954])‚Ä¶but, at the very least, the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burton‚Äôs affectionate biopic ed wood (1994) its famous poster! incidentally, the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles ‚Äì well, for all intents and purposes, glen or glenda constitutes ed wood‚Äôs citizen kane (1941) given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques: in fact, the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore (many of it irrelevant, such as the bewildering instances of s&m) and inane dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy)! the film‚Äôs sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction/phenomenon of transvestism is, however, sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach.for what it‚Äôs worth, the edition i watched was the ‚Äúextended re-issue version‚Äù which included six minutes of ‚Äòdepraved‚Äô footage (directed by w. merle connell) censored on original release! furthermore, my copy went out-of-synch every so often (which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track) ‚Äì though, thankfully, this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself.

i saw the biopic of ed wood many years ago. tim burton payed loving homage to this extremely untalented but yet enthusiastic filmmaker.then i saw plan 9 and it actually tickled me to no end. a silly story, kind of bad production values but still entertaining and even funny.then this. what can you make of it. well, since wood has been reported as being a cross-dresser it is startling to see a movie that deals with it like a cartoon. yes, there are some stabs at teaching the audience something about the subject but mostly this is some kind of really twisted self-parody.one of it's problems is that it has a hundred points of view. on one hand it is a plea for tolerance. another portrays transvestism as a disease. and finally, it tells the audience: "okay, if you are schocked now, then wait until you see this!" the problem must have been that wood had to compromise in order for the film to be made. you can almost sense it when you see the opening title from the producer: personally supervised by... so, where are we. this is neither a serious subject movie or an all-out schocker.the entertainment value is practically nil. the wooden voice-over is mildly amusing but only because it sounds so misguided. this was made in the 50s though, so one can argue that was brave making a film that even mentioned the word transvestites. it all comes down to what the film itself is trying to advocate against. schock. the rape scene, while mild is there simply to do that.so, sorry. this is a misfire but the discredit is not wood's alone.

let me say this about edward d. wood jr. he had a passion for his work that i wish more people did have. if we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of ed wood, the world would probably be a much better place. being familiar with ed wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic "ed wood" (1994) several times, i admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved; i still admire his never-say-die attitude. he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modern-day hollywood had.but that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch. and "glen or glenda," his first and most confessional film, is probably his very worst."glen or glenda" is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named glen (played by director/writer ed wood himself) who despite his love for his fianc√©e barbara (dolores fuller), cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism, in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes...glenda! glen/glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called "the scientist" played by veteran horror star bela lugosi. oh, and there's also some sub-story about an alan/anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the christine jorgenson story, upon whom this movie originally titled "i changed my sex!" was previously to be based.have i dropped your jaw yet? well, as much as i want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it, i would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis i just gave you. every thing in it is true. this is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner. i'm sure that with a good screenplay, and a good director (it had neither) that "glen or glenda," despite the subject matter, could have been a very moving picture. it is a confessional movie on wood's part, as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen. but once again, that does not make it a good movie...or a watchable one for that matter. "glen or glenda" is a jumbled, disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. it makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where bela lugosi screams "pull the string!" over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison. the majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short informative films i've seen before. it's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull. we sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes. there is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens. the only moments that are worth anybody's time are those of bela lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. i guess lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film, but personally, i couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be. i'll tell you what he was: a gifted actor who wound up making trash. but he and wood were very good friends and liked working with each other, so good for him.i will always admire edward d. wood jr. for his passion for the cinema, but i will never as long as i live admire his movies. a film critic once called ed wood's movies "innocent fun" but i think even that is questionable. innocent? yes. fun? no, sir. and if "citizen kane" is the mount everest of the cinematic world, then "glen or glenda" is probably the mariana trench.

whew! what can one say about this bizarre, stupefying mock-u-mentory about ed wood's cross-dressing fantasies?? well, one word that comes to mind is incoherent! wood uses raw slabs of innocuous, incidental stock footage, and then builds a "story" around them - and what a story!! wood himself stars as glen, a regular joe who just happens to enjoy lounging around in his fiancee's lingerie and sweaters. i think what wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the glens of this world by showing that glen is just like all of us underneath, only in angora. ummm...ok. but then, we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devil, a chick in bondage, some rude, pointing people, some moore stock footage, and finally an emaciated bela lugusi,playing some kind of twisted, invalid puppetmaster. lugosi is a howl, spouting out such rubbish as "beeevaaare...the beeeg greeeen dragon that seeets at your doorstep: he eeeets leeetle boys, puppydog tails, and beeeeeg snails!" um, ok, bela... :=8/ there is a strange, twisted type of wood logic going on here. afterall, he does remind us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats, and 7 out of 10 men are bald". hmmm, must be that alien/cross-dressing/habidashery cowspiracy-thang!! glen or glenda stars a plethora (whatever that is...) of reliable wood schlock-actors, including lyle talbot, delores fuller, and timothy farrell, and wood manages to coax every bit of wretched, amateurish non-talent out of each one. everybody by now knows bela's sad story: by the time wood used him for this flic, he was probably jonesing for another fix and needed the moolah, but even for him this is depth heretofore unreached. one of the moocow's favorite wood mooments comes with the stock footage charging buffalo scene - it is sooo loopily demented!! the moocow says "puuuull de schtriiiiings", and git yer hooves on a copy of glen or glenda - you won't believe it! :¬ç

"glen or glenda" was edward d. wood jr's first attempt at directing a feature film. for this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart...transvestism, the "art" of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes. to his credit, wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953. unfortunately, wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film.the story opens with a prologue by bela lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite glen/glenda (daniel davis aka ed wood). inspector warren (lyle talbot) with the help of psychiatrist dr. alton (timothy farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) this way.glen is engaged to barbara (dolores fuller) and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession. and that's it. we see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of wood walking down the same street dressed as either glen or glenda and looking longingly at women's clothes in a store window. poor old bela, who was down on his luck and befriended by wood, keeps popping in throughout the story. i'm not 100% sure but i think bela's scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed.to add to the confusion of lugosi's narration, farrell as dr. alton also provides off screen narration. lugosi keeps saying, bevare, bevare...take care, take care, as well as, some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog's tails.the story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and wood's character(s). the dream sequences are laughable. a wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example. wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors(?) fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination, risqu√© for 1953.this film along with wood's other "classics" were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. for that reason, they have survived to this day.

and generally speaking, you will eventually have to research this little gem. when describing i changed my sex, or glen or glenda as it is better known, i must echo the thoughts of andrew smith, who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote "if you haven't seen any of ed wood's other movies, this one is a completely bewildering experience. if you have seen any of ed wood's movies, this is still completely bewildering". the film is both hilarious and tragic, yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length. wood, bless him, had some of the loftiest ambitions as a director, wanting to promote peace, understanding, and even acceptance, in the 1950s of all times. when tim burton recreated a viewing of glen or glenda by studio execs for his biopic, he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a put-on. more than fifty years later, there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the "normal" take for granted, so i say it most certainly is not.no, the real comedy in glen or glenda is the sheer ineptitude wood displays in composing his message. directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes, and can be edited to fit with their own footage. ed wood used stock footage indiscriminately, and tim burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which wood as played by johnny depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage. sadly, the real ed wood died before he had a chance, but glen or glenda is the closest he ever came. the imdb states that twenty percent of this sixty-something minute film is stock footage, and it is never difficult to guess which footage. footage of busy highways, planes flying overhead, poor lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing, they're all used in a haphazard manner, sometimes repeatedly, and they often only have a loose connection to the story wood is trying to tell. had wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while, there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved.wood himself appears in the film as the titular character, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named glenda. aside from the daring manner in which he attempts to make his point, wood makes one hideous woman. having found myself out on the fringe of a society that thinks i am "disabled" and need to be "cured" myself, i honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for wood's character. in order to make his point, however, wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites. one of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman, the other finds himself so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide. the scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the transvestism and substituted such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or such things as schizophrenia, very little of the film would even need to be changed. that is how little society has learned since ed wood was a boy.the other significant personality in glen or glenda is bela lugosi, whom wood shoehorned into the film. speculation varies upon wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that wood wanted to help revive lugosi's career, and would do anything in order to achieve this. with the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good film, that is. in glen or glenda, wood makes usage of lugosi that was best described in flying saucers over hollywood as "bizarre". lugosi plays a character billed as the scientist, but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master. people who have not seen ed wood films before the biopic will think tim burton made up the "beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep" speech. if anything, burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting wood-ian dialogue. nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context, not even criswell's hilarious ranting during plan 9 from outer space.observant types will also note the presence of delores fuller, wood's girlfriend at the time. again, burton dramatises her reaction to seeing the script for the first time, whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward-thinking. i cannot help but feel that burton's portrayal is more accurate, as fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role. she only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her cast-mates, if such a thing is possible. whether wood's direction was better-focused in this case than usual is hard to determine, but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of bela) in the dust is any guide, then it should come as no surprise that fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other wood film. that she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. while wood would appear before the camera again, it was never as more than a cameo, a walk-on, or a bit-part.i gave glen or glenda a one out of ten. i generally only give this rating to films that are so bad they become entertaining as a result. bold and well-intentioned as it was, glen or glenda fits that description to a t.

i agree with one commentator who says that it's really impossible to review glen or glenda? objectively. if one does so, the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious, convoluted dialog, the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values. yet, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds. it isn't the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. it's not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic.no, what makes glen or glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so-called auteur directors like hitchcock or godard, despite their vastly superior talents, never did. in glen or glenda, wood isn't afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film. indeed, the conclusion of the film suggest that ed wood's glen character will be able to "kill" his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife, barbara. the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference, glenda will disappear. so, while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general, he wasn't so sure of desiring it for himself.moreover, wood wasn't afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen. he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on. if it didn't cohere, so what? what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed wood's imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness.the only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph. the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i don't think can be rated.

sitting in a big wing chair with a huge book in his lap, the one and only bela lugosi looks into the camera and, in a dreadful vocal delivery that sounds as if he were mocking a reading of shakespeare, intones sloooow-ly: "man's constant groping of things unknown, drawing from the endless reaches of time, brings to light many startling things; (snicker); startling?, because they seem new (lugosi's eyes now bulging, with raised eyebrows, and mouth sneering, he continues) but most are not new, the signs of the ages" (cue a visual of lightening, accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to rumble for an astonishing 86 seconds).and so begins what is arguably the worst film ever made. this "movie" almost defies description. told in semi-docudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot ... such as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named glen (ed wood, jr.) who cross-dresses; hence the reference to glenda. the film has no real structure. instead, it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or may not ... relate to glen or to the cross-dressing motif. one long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as s&m.then, at odd moments bela reappears, for no apparent reason, and babbles more inane dialogue, like: "when he's wrong because he does right, and when he's right because he does wrong; pull the string, dance to that." huh?about twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage, accompanied by a vo that relates to the story motif but not the visuals. hence, we see stock footage of: bustling city streets, freeway traffic, a thunderous herd of buffalo, and a playground full of kids. but it gets worse. in a film about cross-dressing, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from wwii.even the simplest items are botched. in one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads "man nabbed dressed as girl". underneath the headline, which has clearly been glued or pasted on, the article is about ... taxes. in one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen woman spouts out: "airplanes, why it's against the creator's will", in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium.except for the performance of lyle talbot, the acting is uniformly horrendous. production design is cheap looking and drab; (but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper). the editing is sloppy. most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators. the b&w cinematography has way too much contrast. and the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store.this film is so bad it makes "plan 9 from outer space" look like "citizen kane", by comparison. i just don't know how one could make a film any worse than ed wood's "glen or glenda". but thankfully, it's got bela lugosi in it. every time he opened his mouth, and gazed into the camera with those big, bulging eyes, i about fell on the floor laughing.

this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! ok so pros and cons. pros beautiful setting in hawaii, looks good on bluray. cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. predictable poor plot. zero character development. forced jokes which fall flat. many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap.

i endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity. it has to be one of the worst films i have ever sat through. i am amazed that this film currently has a 7.5 star rating. the acting is awful, script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow. for a funny film i cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy. do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure. check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience. i sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film, in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon. come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.

i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. after seeing the trailer i thought - what an unfunny movie full of clich√©s. but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well. what a waste of time... the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, i couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies, but that also is pretty pass√©. i couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because i found them utterly stupid. the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally.

this movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just make me wanna scream: "lame". nicholas stoller write the movie "yes man", but direct "this" maybe he should stick with writing.i am so disappointed because i heard all the great review. i was expecting something like knocked up. they say this is from the maker of "knocked up"? why can't i see the resemblance? but this just felt like a shallow, overdone-theme kind of movie for me. i am so disappointed. actually it's not bad if you consider it as your-average-chick-movie, but that character of the "band guy" just get on my nervesmaybe i was just not paying enough attention to the movie, but yeah they have some funny lines and scene, but i don't felt the originality. and the ending make the movie a little bit better. at least the ending is not some boring clich√© one.

this movie was bad but it was so bad that it may reach cult status in the distant future. a sort of film-noir meets plan 9 from outer space. the story was, well, there wasn't actually a story. there is a place reserved for the ed woods and russ meyers of the world and this film proves it. "so bad it might be good" is the best way to describe it. i seriously doubt if this movie will be picked up by any legitimate distribution company therefore it is unlikely to see wide release.i will add that i expect to see more of actor ron carey. he made the best of what he had. the rest of the acting, if i can call it that, was quite forgettable. i have seen worse from big studios with vast budgets.

yeah, i know his character was supposed to be a drunk, and he may have been just acting goofy. but something tells this critic that mr. pleasence really was drinking a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the film. basically everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible. or maybe it was just the poor productions values... hard to say.anyway, the race for the yankee zephyr is a film that just doesn't work. that's a shame, too, since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot. ultimitely the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this new zealand adventure to deliver the goods. the story deals with a us war plane which is filled with gold, money, and medals, which crashes into a lake in new zealand during wwii. the plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk (pleasence) literally stumbles onto it. at first he gathers up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town, actually getting $75 apiece for them! little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane. before you can blink, all of the attention brings a wealthy scumbag (peppard) and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals. the old drunk's business partner (wahl) and his daughter (warren) then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it. the resulting action just isn't as fun as you'd hope it would be.the acting is rather awful, save for pleasence. george peppard tries to do some kind of (i guess) austrailian accent, but it is hardly convincing. lesley ann warren isn't too bad, but ken wahl is really bad. he's basically doing his best impression of michael pare on his worst day. and that's saying something. hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked. i don't recall if he'd had them straightened by the time he was in wiseguy. the rest of the cast are pretty untalented. probably mostly locals who never did much else. i guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film, and the lack of danger. the villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously. and honestly, there are no helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the dvd cover. and none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them, either.the film does have its strengths, though. the beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch. brian may's score sounds a little too much like the one in mad max 2, but he included a nice little march they play for pleasence in some scenes. sounds just like the one in the great escape! there are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. the scenery, despite the grainy look of the picture, is still quite beautiful. the thing you'll remember most is the drunken antics of donald pleasence, though. he was almost enough to save this film. almost. 4 of 10 stars.the hound.

at the opposite end of the spectrum from raiders of the lost ark is david hemmings' utterly inferior adventure regarding the salvage of a world war ii-era plane with a valuable cargo. assets include beautiful new zealand settings, brian may's energetic music score and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat chases. the bad, however, far outweighs the good. donald pleasence hams as perhaps never before; half of his dialog is almost unintelligible. george peppard attempts an australian (i think) accent, then gives it up halfway through. lesley ann warren is at her most irritating. ken wahl is, well, ken wahl. the dialog is painful to hear and hemmings' direction is largely inept. the script is not only obvious but terrible. jokes fall flat, scenes carry no punch and continuity is virtually non-existent. according to the end credits, two men were killed piloting jet boats during the making of the film. what a waste.

first off, the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a new zealand lake, inside a downed world war 2 plane is a great opening. what follows is nothing but cartoon like drivel. men chasing men, cars chasing men , helicopters chasing men, helicopters chasing boats, boats chasing boats, for the better part of an hour, the most boring nonsense, with absolutely no advancement to the story. special mention must be made of the chop shop editing, as many scenes seem to have been spliced together in random order. the acting by all concerned is an embarrassment. one last thing, the picture quality and sound quality is so bad on this dvd that you will be appalled. - merk

if movies where virtual reality characters come to life and they are all either male tough guys or female eye candy sounds good to you, then perhaps this movie may not be a total waste of film. needless to say, the overwhelming majority of people will find this to be an absolute bore, with little acting talent, and even less of a script. yes, athena massey is nice to look at, but that is the only positive thing that i can say about this disaster.

why is it that virtual "x-rated video game" women can speak through their mouths but virtual fighting game champion dante has to use a combination of telepathy and over dramatic facial expressions? i feel that either they needed to cast someone who looked more villain-like (michael bermardo's big brown doe eyes don't exactly strike fear in the hearts of well.. anyone except for maybe casting directors who consistently cast him as either a villain or a heroic 'bad boy'.) or they needed to just let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a costume that would not make him stick out like a sore thumb when walking down the street. (but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm.)

i actually liked this movie. sure, the acting was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the lamest that i've seen. michael bernardo as dante is worth laughs in his own right, with an incredibly funny catchphrase and evil laugh. but its worth seeing, just for the worst explosion you will ever see outside of the power rangers tv series. you'll know it when you see it. honestly, this movie must have the budget of a low grade porno. i almost stopped watching after an hour, but i recommend watching through the whole thing; at the very least, there's plenty of eye candy for all to enjoy. recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to poor movies.

everybody loves to see a really bad movie sometime. you watch it, take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour. but this is not one of those. it's the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while.i would like to see someone to take responsibility for dante - he's really the most stupid villain you can think of: a guy in leather pants that speaks with a voice over and has a victory laugh like a 50's dracula. how can someone came up with this guy?? and the hero..."the dragon" or whatever...my cereals box has better acting skills than him (maybe than all of them), it's unbelievable. but the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it. they're so lame, it's beyond any kind of description. there's no shame, i just can't believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. but i'm just thrilled it was. watching this is a self-mutilating pleasure. see this only if you're in a movie quest for pain, and in that case, this one is a sure winner.

so pathetic its not even funny. from the first scene in the movie i knew i was in for a bad time. thank goodness i only saw this movie on tv. the story line was terrible, not to mention the acting. it was horrid. very unreal and unusual things happened in this move such as. the lady sticks a whip under the door and whips the guy a little and he just hands over the keys. i'm like, get real. the creators lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my dislike for the film. to tell you the truth the only good thing in this movie at all was the fighting, which was in itself pretty lame. all i could ask myself when watching this movie was "when is it gonna go off!"

this harold lloyd short wasn't really much; not one of his funnier efforts. of course, i never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. that's what the bulk of this story is, harold and his wife, mildred davis, babysitting his in-laws two young kids. one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (noah young) is burglarizing their house. half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some good sight gags, reminding me of another lloyd short, "haunted spooks."however, the good ending doesn't save the whole picture, which i probably wouldn't watch again. lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. it just isn't that funny.

the film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from something weird video in their "driver's ed scare films vol. 5". for one thing the 1980 version is in color. swv has on this disc an earlier version (1972) of the film made in b&w for wlwt television channel 5 in cincinnati. either way this film is notorious. however, unlike most other driver's ed films, this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public. thus the level of carnage has been ratcheted down. it's still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent. i live in the cincinnati area and i remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on channel 5. if you're looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely american film phenomenon, "the last prom" is pretty typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. whether it really affected any teenager's driving at all is anyone's guess.

i was invited to view this film at a small art museum screening. i had no clue what to expect. i was initially optimistic in the opening credits to see judd nelson, bill paxton, wayne newton, james cann, rob lowe, and lara-flynn-boyle listed. however after some very disturbing grossed-out scenes (that did not add much to the story advancement), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. the gimmick of the vestigial growing arm storyline is never really developed. i patiently kept waiting for this film to cash-in. there was a small payoff in the end, but having to invest and sit through the the endless gross, crude, sexually-perverted, in-your-face screaming, unfunny gore cost too much for me (even for a free viewing). what were these established actors doing in this awful film? the art direction was very convincing and creepy. at the very minimum, it should only be a 75-minute film. this is a film that dick cheney and donald rumsfeld would embrace.

this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it. the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot.i'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton (who i feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). a freak accident alters nelson's career course and mayhem ensues.the attempts at humor were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing - comedically or otherwise.overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon. at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space. this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. one of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness.

ok, fans, it's out on dvd. but the only reason to watch this is 1) to say you did (due to its notoriety), or 2) if you're a hardcore bill paxton fan. i am not a hardcore bp fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom. it's a shame, because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence (and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson). sure it's gross, but it's bad, and not in a good way. if after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and dystopianly filthy this movie is you are still interested, do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead. films by john waters, david lynch, peter jackson's "braindead", henenlotter's "basket case", etc., all come to mind. there's lots better out there.

teenager tamara (jenna dewan) has it rough. she's ridiculed by all the popular "kids" for being shy, bookish, frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft. all of the football players and cheerleaders are especially angry at her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school paper. on top of this, her dad's a drunk, her mom's not around and she's secretly in love with her supportive english teacher (matthew marsden). the popular kids set up a cruel prank to humiliate her, accidentally kill her during a struggle, bury the body in the woods and make a pact to keep silent. to their shock, the very next day tamara walks back into the classroom looking seductive and, uh, dressed to kill. yep, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved. she also takes time out to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her english teacher away from his wife (claudette mink), a guidance counselor at the school.acting and writing are strictly mediocre. you can also tell the people responsible for this have seen such movies as carrie (1976), hello mary lou: prom night ii (1987) and the craft (1996) because it borrows wholesale from all three of those superior films. there's some gore (a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing his eyeball probably being the best bit), a nasty vomiting scene and a few campy/witty one-liners. not an awful film by any means, but not much originality went into it either.

"tamara" just felt like another teen oriented knock-off of the "i know what you did last summer" trend and is painfully dull. a high school outcast, who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods, vowing to tell no one. the next day, the supposedly "dead" tamara, arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would-be killers and has a little revenge... this is basically a combination of "carrie", "the craft", and every other straight-to-video, teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. the actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high schoolers. there is some gore, which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldn't wait for it to end. if you like modern garbage than i insist you seek this one out, otherwise don't bother...

i saw this movie, and i do like horror movies.i did not know what to expect, but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it. the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. especially jenna dewan as the exciting/evil tamara.the hardest thing about horror movies, is to make a good ending. but there the movie failed. for a change, a end-scene in a hospital, where suddenly all employees are gone. first you see doctors and nurses running around, but then they all went home?no cries for help while being chased by tamara, escaping to the roof (also a smart move...not) and off course a kind of open ending.no....the movie started great, the main part was nice to watch, but they really messed up the ending using all clich√©s from bad horror movies. jeffrey reddick failed in my eyes with this movie, after making some really quality movies like final destination 1 and 2.if you like a good horror full of clich√© endings, tamara is a good movie to watch. for me, i like movies which surprise me.

i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free- thank god, had i paid for it my review would be less forgiving.well, the major idea of the film (geeky girl takes bloody revenge) isn't all that original, there are several parallels to "carrie" (playing a mean practical joke on a loser, except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her, tamaras and carries bad family background). i still think it's a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn't take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things.what worked: i liked the actress that played tamara. she looked great (when she was hot) and her catty lines were fun ("sean can't come to the phone. he's f**king patrick!").what didn't work: the whole wicca thing was silly. i generally prefer rational explanations (she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge). there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad (when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue- please!!!)the whole idea wasn't bound for oscar buzz, but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had. it was bearable but far from good!

star rating: ***** unmissable **** very good *** okay ** you could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs the tale of the titular adam (mark o' halloran) and paul (tom murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of dublin and their daily amblings about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day. along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years.i know a lot of irish people like to drink, but it seems some of them have problems with heroin, too by the looks of this movie. i know there is a bit of a drug problem over there, like there is in many parts of the world, so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing.i don't recall the last irish movie i saw (the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film i've seen lately!) and, judging from that, obviously i'm not as enlightened on their humour as i could be. the film is rather funny in certain parts, but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to raise near-the-knuckle laughs. the scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and i'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn't put a smile on my face! it's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to-and-fro. in light of this, some may find the ending sad, others may see it as just desserts.overall, i just failed to see the point to the film. i didn't see any motivation in the 'story' it was telling. it just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way. unlike trainspotting (which dealt with similar themes!) it's an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it's very short 83 minute running time. really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day. **

i saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because i felt it was a waste of time. the idea to make a film through the eyes of a headsman - one of the "evil guys" throughout most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers plenty of possibilities but... the film couldn't catch one of them. i was not feeling for any of the characters, the plot was all too predictable (to the point that i followed it)and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit. those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a headsman in the middle ages, a social outcast to that time, might be disappointed.

this had the promise of being an interesting film. the subject matter was certainly a promising one - the excesses of the catholic church during the counter-reformation. however, not only was this not developed (other than a two paragraph introduction), many things were not explained - i.e. the gypsies, the anabaptists, the inquisitors and their relationship to the one true church. nor were the politics of the time explained, i.e. the relationship between the catholic church and its supporters like the holy roman emperor. though these may have been apparent to an austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes it confusing for americans.but perhaps it's a good thing that they didn't emphasize the history since what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway. instruments of torture, bloody executions, witch and heretic burnings, big shiny swords and pretty golden reliquaries are the stars of the film. it could have just as easily been one of those conan-type sword and sorcery movies, only with period costumes...

the biggest problem with "in search of historic jesus" is that there is very little search to it at all. shick-sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and just into the '80s, which featured interviews with "experts" and discussion of "science" and "facts" to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on.sadly, "historic jesus" is really little more than a third-rate dramatization of the life of christ. unlike shick-sunn's more superior "in search of noah's ark" which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be, this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence. the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned, but little other detective work is given much screen time.for fans of these quasi-documentary films like "jupiter menace" and "in search of bigfoot", etc., this movie doesn't offer much.

as a documentary, this is laughable in a campy sort of way -- a schlocky collection of re-created biblical tableaux mixed in with solemn interviews of so-called "experts." think of it as an infommercial which pushes jesus instead of thigh-masters. however, the detailed crucifixion scene is, in terms of historical accuracy, superior to similar scenes in such widescreen hollywood extravaganzas as "ben-hur," "king of kings," and "the greatest story ever told." rather than dragging his entire cross to golgotha, for example, john rubinstein simply carries his crossbeam strapped across his shoulders to his outstretched arms. nails aren't driven through his palms but instead through his wrists. his feet aren't nailed separately but one is placed over the other so that just one nail need be used. incidentally, rubinstein's flogging prior to his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book, "lash! the hundred great scenes of men being whipped in the movies."of course, rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths, which probably isn't true to the shameful reality of roman crucifixions, but allowances must be made. curiously, the "good" thief is positioned on the left hand of jesus, which goes against a long-standing tradition. just why this thief is played by a pudgy, overweight man is, however, a mystery, especially in view of the fact that the "bad" thief is something of a "hunk."

am not from america, i usually watch this show on axn channel, i don't know why this respected channel air such sucking program in prime time slot. creation of hollywood's money bank jerry bruckheimer, this time he is spending a big load of cash in the small screen. in each episode a bunch of peoples having two team members travels from on country to another for a great sum of money; where the camera crews shoot their travels. i don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. it has nothing to watch for, in all episodes we see people ran like beggars, some times shouting, crying, beeping, jerky camera works..huh it's harmful to both eyes and ears. the most disgusting part in the race is the viewers finally knows each of the team members can't enjoy their race/traveling experience. even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in one shows, sucking american reality show.it's nothing to watch for, better switch to another channels.the amazing race = the disgusting show.

scarlet dawn casts douglas fairbanks, jr. as a russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the russian revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. he's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work. doug might have been caught by the reds but for the fact that his former servant nancy carroll didn't give him away. nancy's got a big old crush on doug and they do marry once arriving in exile in istanbul which throughout the film is referred to by its former christian name of constantinople. they marry and settle down with doug now reduced to washing dishes.but fairbanks's former mistress lilyan tashman who's always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once accustomed to as part of a swindle against father and daughter american tourists guy kibbee and sheila terry. good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes, usually those were given to b westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic. the ending is rather unbelievable. doug knew he was in a thanksgiving special and really overacts to cover up the defects of a unbelievable story.what i didn't understand was that fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new soviet union? that didn't make sense to me at all.i'd only see this if i was a dedicated fan of any the main players.

this movie has lots of action and little heart. let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the russian revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. in fact, the czar abdicated after world war i proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw russia from the war. now, back to our story.here we have the revolution being "rumored" in russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman baron nikita 'nikki' krasnoff (douglas fairbanks jr.). he flees his home with his former servant girl tanyusha (nancy carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in constantinople. before the revolution the baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. the revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. it certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. tanyusha follows the baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on nikki hand and foot. once in constantinople, nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, russian aristocrat vera zimina, who has a plan for getting them to paris where the tsarists have congregated after the revolution. unfortunately for tanyusha, vera's plan does not include her.this film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress nancy carroll. she does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. lilyan tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as russian vamp vera. lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. guy kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an american tourist who is curious about the russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland.

this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. the alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant "galaxy" but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. a better title for the film would be "it came from the planet of plot contrivances." the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. any thought to the passage of time is ignored. now it's a couple days after meeting the alien, then bam! all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour. do yourself a favor and miss this movie. you will make yourself stupider for having watched it. the ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going "ta-da!!!!" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it. if you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself ("enemies of freedom"--honestly) laughing, you're retarded.

an intelligent summation of cold war era mutually assured destruction policy, up until the conclusion: it's a gasser! all russians and chinese are obliterated from the face of the earth! saw this one at the 27th annual cwru science fiction marathon, january 2002.

i made sure to see this film because it is a 1950s sci-fi film--one of my favorite genres. unfortunately, while i was looking forward to either bug-eyed aliens or power-mad conquerers, the aliens in this film were a major disappointment! first, you only see one very briefly at the beginning (and he looked pretty ordinary) and you also only got a tiny glimpse of a spaceship! second, the alien was neither the evil conquerer or the benevolent friend of mankind--but a real odd-ball. and finally, the plot itself seemed so dumb, preachy and heavy-handed that it elicited more yawns than thrills.as the film begins, five people from five different parts of the world (germany, britain, russia, china and the usa) are kidnapped by an alien. the alien gives each of them devices by which they can destroy all life on the planet if they so choose--because, the alien admits that his race of people would love to inhabit the earth but they themselves won't kill to get it. then, he returns them all. while it's 100% obvious that no one would want to use these devices, the alien then announces on tv the identities of the five without telling that the weapons are that powerful! so, all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five going into hiding and one being tortured to get him to reveal how the device works--as the soviets want to use it!!! this part of the film just seemed pretty silly. sure the ussr was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but it's fact--especially under stalin), they never would have thought of using it like they did in the movie! later, one of the five (the german scientist), somehow figures out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the evil people who hate freedom. so, he uses it to wipe out all the evil commies and presumably others who were anti-freedom and the world then becomes a paradise!! preachy, silly and full of plot holes--this movie just isn't worth your time, though it is an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses communism--in particular, the tensions between nato and the soviets.

this is another of hollywood's anti-communist polemics of the golden 1950s. stalwart american gene barry, lovely englishwoman valerie french, and three others are kidnapped by an alien and given clamshells containing fantastic--and fantastically vague--power. what will the earthlings do with such power? toss it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of mankind? anybody who knows american cinema circa 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do, but the story gets ripe when the americans actually test the things in the middle of the pacific. then one scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! his smarmy attitude afterward is nauseating, and the cheery disposition of everyone else is appalling.here's the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only "confirmed enemies of freedom"! that's right--don't worry about the ethical conundrum of killing everyone that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom; just do it! hurray! no commies! silly female--and you threw yours into the sea! ha ha! kiss me, baby!

just listen to the broadway cast album and to the voices of barbara harris and john cullum, who do wonders for the wonderful lerner and lane score. then, with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind, watch the movie, with streisand as streisand, and yves montand reading his lines with such a heavy french accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. the best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what montand does to the introductory part of the title song. listen as he sings/says: could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue, what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do? (that one part sums up the problem that results from casting "name stars" in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) i can just see rex harrison entering that scene and suggesting montand, too, could learn to do justice to the beauty of the english language.

"on a clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a new age update of the "pygmalion" / "my fair lady" story: a professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman. this time, however, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression.you know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music. the songs are instantly forgettable. (no "get me to the church on time" here, i'm afraid.) and the plot goes nowhere. to paraphrase gertrude stein, there is no "there" here. the characters wander through the story without ever getting from point a to point b. professor chabot claims several times that he will get to the root of daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do so.all meaningful conflict is avoided. for instance, there comes a time when chabot's university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position. now there is conflict! will he give up his career for daisy? alas! nothing comes of this development. a scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells chabot to continue on with his work. so much for conflict.the talent was certainly assembled for this movie: directed by vincente minnelli. written, in part, by alan jay lerner. a cast of yves montand, bob newhart and jack nicholson. and, oh yes, starring barabara striesand who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career.but it all falls flat. lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned "my fair lady," is as doomed to failure as daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past.if you enjoy movie musicals, there are far better choices than this.

in trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached, oacd,ycsf was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization. here it's past life regression, esp and hypno-therapy... pretty loopy! the real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; just where can a movie go, and what can happen, when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand? it can't go any place new, but strangely, it can't even go any place old! indeed, if it could, audiences would still have no interest in the union of yves montand (playing a much older, arrogant, french ass) and streisand. (a much younger girl). we never become invested in them, their situations or outcomes. montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible.it's all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable; despite efforts here and there from minelli that are respectable. it's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success... that's just too passe! streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer, as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. but she over-relies on her ingratiating (translation: irritating) kooky, jewish girl shtick. she can however sing very well, at both the "gentle" and "powerhouse" ends of the range. amidst a score of musical dross, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs* of much higher caliber than anything fanny or dolly had to offer. 'he isn't you' is a sweet trifle as sublime as lorenz hart's 'my funny valentine,' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between chabot and melinda.the only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film. strong research shows a longer, better-explained and more decorative, but not necessarily a better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. you can be sure there's be more babs in that version but more importantly, there'd be more thoughtful work from minelli.in the end montand sends babs off to sing the title song, after she discovers he's a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook. and she takes the bait. so, uh... hooray for that.(*hurry it's lovely up here, love with all the trimmings, he isn't you, & the title song)

last time i checked, the nazis didn't win the second world war - not that you'd sodding notice. after all, the third reich was pretty big on issuing orders and demanding cold, robotic obedience from the populace, and that's pretty much what we're saddled with today. but the way the orders are delivered has changed. instead of being barked at in a german accent through a loudhailer, they're disguised as concerned expert advice and floated under your nose every time you switch on the tv or flip open a newspaper there's a continual background hum, a middle-class message of self-improvement, whispered on the wind."you eat too much. you eat the wrong things. you drink. you smoke. you don't get enough exercise. you probably can't even *beep* properly. you'll die if you don't change your ways. your health will suffer. have you got no self-respect? look at you. you sicken me. i pity you. i hate you. we all hate you. god hates you. don't you get it? it's so sad, what you're doing to yourself. it's just so bloody sad." that's the mantra. and it goes without saying that the people reciting it are routinely depicted as saints. last year, the media dropped to its knees to give jamie oliver a collective blow job over his school dinners series, in which he campaigned to get healthier food put on school menus. given the back-slapping reaction, you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd personally rescued 5,000 children from the jaws of a slavering paedophile.anyway, the series was a huge success. in fact in telly terms there was only one real drawback: it wasn't returnable. after all, when you've saved every child in the nation from certain death once, you can't really do it a second time. the only solution is to find a new threat, which brings us to ian wright's unfit kids (wed, 9pm, c4), a weekly "issuetainment" programme in which the former footballer and renowned enemy of grammar forces a bunch of overweight youngsters to take part in some extra-curricular pe.it's essentially a carbon copy of the jamie oliver show, with more sweating and fewer shots of pupils mashing fresh basil with a pestle: an uplifting fable in which wrighty shapes his gang of misfits into a lean, mean, exercising' machine - combating apathy and lethargy, confronting lazy parents, and attempting to turn the whole thing into a nationwide issue that'll have range rover mums everywhere dampening their knickers with sheer sanctimony in between trips to the conran shop. oh isn't it simply terrible, what these blob-some plebes do to themselves? not our josh you understand: he eats nothing but organic spinach and attends lacrosse practise six hundred times a week.bet he does, the little sh1t yes, it is heartwarming to watch flabby, inconvenient kids transforming themselves with a bit of simple activity... but there's something about the underlying eat-your-greens message that really sticks in my craw, in case you hadn't guessed.what happened to the concept of choice, you *beep* so a bit of jogging might increase your life expectancy - so what? that just equates to a few more years in the nursing home - whoopee do. and besides, i'd rather drop dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of smug toss ends trying to out-health one another.in episode two, video games and the internet are singled out as villains in the war on flab: they make kids too sedentary, you see. oddly enough, tv, which is equally sedentary, and unlike those two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy along with your physique, escapes without a rollicking. funny that.well listen here, channel 4 - instead of forcing kids to eat bracken or do squat-thrusts, how about teaching them to think more expansively, so they reject the sly, cajoling nature of programmes like this? or would that be a campaign too far?

the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad jobs, and on and on. they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves. however, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be wealthy, successful, and attractive. tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt. if nutrition is really that important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods. if they really believed in their computer simulations, i'd like to see them do a double-blind test by finding some 40-year-olds, finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children, and age-progressing the kids' photos. then compare to the real things. hey, that sounds like a project for mythbusters! discovery channel--are you listening?tlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons.

well, i don't normally think there's such a thing as a horrible movie, but this is pretty damned close! the best acting performance in the whole thing was snoop dogg, who has one line in a 10 second scene. i agree with the "glad it was short" review. the music videos at the end were cool though.

this movie rips off of every mobster/gangster film ever made. mp da last don has a reference to every movie. the acting was by far the worst i have every seen. who the hell is john mario anyway? his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen. he makes bad actors look good. as far as master p goes, he's selling out quicker than an n*sync concert. i really wish i was there to tell the whole production company: what the hell were you thinking when penning the script?" obviously these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out their gangster lives for real in their minds. one thing i do know is that there wasn't anyone who wanted to distribute this film so it seems (and how predictable) that the guys at no limit had to start; no limit films. i've said enough! this movie is terrible and it does not deserve to be called a movie!

when i saw this movie i think i was a freshman in high school and i still feel like charging master p for the hour & 20 mins or so that he took from my life that i'll never get back.the guy who already posted is completely right. master p is a wannabe mobster. he, like all the other rappers in this country made his millions off of selling rap cds to young impressionable white kids in this country. it's widely known that the mob was not a black thing and blacks were not allowed to be part of it. unfair as that might be rappers can't deal with. this movie paints master p as a mobster named nino? the script is terrible with the acting to match. completely unbelievable. while searching i came up with a link or something that said he was planning on making another movie called "the black sopranos"!!!!please spare us that and stick to nickalodeon. you are not a white mobster, your not even a good actor master p, please stick to your music for the sake of whoever listens to it these days...

this is one entertaining flick. i suggest you rent it, buy a couple quarts of rum, and invite the whole crew over for this one. my favorite parts were.1. the gunfights that were so well choreographed that john woo himself was jealous, .2. the wonderful special effects .3. the academy award winning acting and .4. the fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to be doing a bad "scarface" impersonation. i mean, master p as a cuban godfather! this is groundbreaking territory. and with well written dialogue including lines like "the only difference between you and me rico, is i'm alive and your dead," this movie is truly a masterpiece. yeah right.

this has to be one of, if not the greatest mob/crime films of all time. every thing about this movie is great, the acting in this film is of true quality; master p's acting skills make you actually believe he is italian! the cinematography is excellent too, probably the best ever. this movie was great; and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm.

on the scale of 1 to 10, i gave this a 4. i thought the film was not very good, with too much violence and not one character to like.on an erotic scale, i give this a 6. many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness. i always enjoy nudity, and nancy travis and faye grant come through, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.

i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm. very bad acting, low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie. the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita moreno, (23 years old), playing a teenage indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50's. she reminded me of a earlier version of sue lyon as lolita (1962), only a more innocent lolita. she bounces up and down like a 1950's teeny bopper, almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum, falling all over this old man, willing to give him anything, as he plays it off like she's a hindrance to him. any man in his 50's that had a beautiful, virgin, teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride, would be insane not to take advantage of her. it's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't permit more of an expansion of a character such as rita moreno's. the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is rita moreno's appearance in the movie.

director lesley selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn "the yellow tomahawk" (1954) pits the cheyenne against the u.s. cavalry with leathery tough rory calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. this united artists western was lensed in color but the tv print that turner classic movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.the action opens with adam reed (rory calhoun of "black spurs") eluding several indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and cheyenne chief, fire knife (lee van cleef of "the good, the bad, and the ugly"), who has killing on his mind. fire knife warns adam that his cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the indians made with the government. on his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, major ives (warner anderson of "objective, burma!"),about the impending indian attack, adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. katherine 'kate' bolden (peggy castle of "i, jury") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of indian country without a care in the world. castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. naturally, major ives dismisses adam's warning from fire knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. this is one of the many questions that the richard alan simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? no sooner have they made this discovery than the indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. sawyer (peter graves of "stalag 17") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. while adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. later, we learn that sawyer and his partner had struck gold. the question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. adam and fire knife have one final pow-wow and fire knife demands that adam hand over major ives or everybody will die. naturally, adam refuses and the indians begin to whittle down the whites. james best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. noah beery, jr., plays a aimable mexican scout pursued by a sexy indian damsel appropriately named honey bear (oscar-winning actress rita moreno of "west side story") and robert bray of "lassie" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that kate had planned to marry. the biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in kanab, utah, is that the evil cavalry officer ives, who slaughtered indian men, women, and children at the infamous sand creek massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a native american, too! ironically, the taut bow that fire knife gives out of friendship to adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. "the yellow tomahawk" concludes on an ambiguous note. the survivors reach another outpost, fort ellis, where adam and ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. producer howard w. koch is no relation to "casablanca" scenarist howard koch. ultimately, "the yellow tomahawk" is one of many pro-indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of "broken arrow" (1950) where the native american is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. peter graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. actually, lesley selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called "war paint" (1953) with robert stack. incidentally, noah beery jr. and rita moreno both went on to become regulars on "the rockford files".

yep, edward g. gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world. first he's an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair (played passionately, albeit briefly by deforrest kelly), then he's so filled with remorse his only solace is the bottle. throw in a jaded romance, a genuinely rapid descent into penury and no qualms about who he defends, and next thing you know -- shazam! black leg lawyer (god i love that phrase). he sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair. yawn.but really, the courtroom action is pure melodrama. see him punch out a witness, see him drink poison, see him argue passionately as he clutches a bullet hole in his breast. be prepared for melodrama.the hoot of the film though, is jayne russell. with curves defying the laws of gravity and an iq approached absolute zero, she is something to see. even sings a bit.

i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie. i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk. it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy. another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after. i don't know how folks bleed over there in japan, but i hope they have plenty of blood donors.

so, it has come to this. in the top-rated comment on this flick, somebody says "nishi is an honorable man". really? this is a guy who mainly kills and maims people in the movie. he takes a short break to rob a bank. honorable? how would you like your kids to go to school with the kids of someone who calls that honorable? wait, there's more! the person also says "we can tell he's constantly thinking." how can we do that? well, do you know that joke "how can you tell when a ceo/politician/lawyer is lying?" ... "his/her lips move." well, nishi's lips never move, so i guess that means he is thinking.of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization. existentalism supposedly stresses that an individual take responsibility for the consequences of one's acts. not nishi. borrow money from the yakuza. what, they want it back? kill them. the cops find out. kill yourself and your wife.really honorable.

hana-bi has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing. unfortunately, during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy.for example, why didn't the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him? there was no rescue seen or hinted at.can it be true that japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the suspect's ability to reach for a weapon? these detective-level japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect.why doesn't the right eye of the lead character blink? having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplained.what exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks? he was not seen gambling. being a non entry-level government employee his wife must have had full health insurance.what was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park? what was his reason for being there?how in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve? it made no sense.and again, how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote mt. fuji resort? there were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in, let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time!and a third same question, how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife? the japanese coast line must be vast. were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers?two final questions: the cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach -- where did she come from? she seemed to have no transportation or companions with her. and why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces?! this was weird. unintentionally python-esque.on the positive side, i loved the background music. it was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie. the photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye.one final point, the wife was overly pleasing to the eye. not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person. she looked very healthy. if anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick. the husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly outed gay man would treat a respected wife... a love of friendship, but not close tenderness.a mixed movie for sure.

the only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available. this show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptrap. i tried to support this show in its decline, because i like human interest stories and primetime used to have some very good ones. unfortunately, april 21st has forever changed my mind about this show and the unethical newscasters that participate in it. abc actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations had run out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced. what made it worse was how abc swept the whole incident under the rug; instead of taking charge and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals, they had some pop psychologists send stern warnings to the audience about how they shouldn't judge these poor angels too harshly. i was truly sickened. i hope this review stops one person from watching this investigative trash in the future. if it does, i will be happy. these days, all you can expect from diane sawyer and the good folks from primetime live are butt-kissing sessions with a-list celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised to the stars. don't waste the hour of your life; you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on nick at nite.

i'm sorry to say this but i didn't enjoy this movie at all. it was just too boring. so boring that i couldn't watch the rest of it. it's not as interesting as the lion king or aladdin. that's why i hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be. the movies that disney have released lately really sucks! i miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the lion king, aladdin, pocahontas, cinderella, the aristocats, and robin hood. this movie is really awful. i really tried my best to be interested in this movie but i just couldn't. i don't think i could recommend this film to anyone. i would recommend the ones that i just mention above.

hi there. i watched the first part when it came out, and i don't remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one.first, the animation is choppy, wooden, not worked on, lacks naturality - i understand the drawing style was to be of some 'atlantean' kind, but, it could be done with the usual disney finesse... see "tarzan" to see what i mean. if i didn't see the disney logo in the beginning, i would never say it was a disney movie.second, the plot was more like a pc game style, like a good old quest. not that it was bad, but it lacked a story that binds the viewer to the characters and their goals. it was inconvincing, at least. the film was meant for children, but this was waaay to childish at times.third, the music... i would say it was improper, but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animation...overall, i think this was some kind of an amusement, just by-the-way kind of project by several apprentice animators, just to fill in the count for disney movies. sorry to hear that from myself, a big disney lover...

i am finding that i get less and less excited about disney's sequels to movies. yes, i do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same, but these movies don't even try. some examples are hunchback ii and tarzan and jane. if anyone has seen the previews for stitch-the movie, you will see my point. but i digress, this movie reaffirms my point. the animation is sloppy, the story lines resemble saturday morning cartoons, and not all of the original voices are there. i was very disappointed not to hear michael j. fox's voice. it was so glaringly obvious that the person doing milo's voice was trying to sound like fox, but didn't come close to succeeding. if it says anything, my children ages 10 and 6 didn't even sit through the whole movie.

my main criticism with the movie is the animation. i totally agree with everyone else it was very poor. some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first film, which is much better. also the background colours looked rushed and somewhat static. it is also a shame that michael j.fox didn't voice milo, he did such a good job, and james arnold taylor wasn't sure whether he was supposed to sound like milo or aladdin. i have also taken into consideration the lack of a good storyline. the third story was confusing and clumsily told, and the second story suffered from poor scripting. to make things worse, the first one i can't even remember, other than a fishing village being haunted or something like that. however, there was some nice music, and good voice talents from john mahoney, cree summer, clancy brown and tom wilson, that saved the film from total disaster. all in all, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good film. 4/10 bethany cox.

this movie was horrible, and it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. the way i look at it, it's more like three mediocre day-time disney cartoon episodes strung loosely together to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first atlantis movie, which was way more well-made and enjoyable. and where do i even begin with the problems of this dvd? the story? the characters? the pictures/animation? to me they're all bad and unwatchable. firstly, the story in this direct-to-video dvd is ridiculous and pointless. the only good thing about it is that it is consistent--that is, consistently bad, from the beginning to the end. after the film's over i still don't know why milo has returned and how the incidents occur in the three small stories are related to each other or to atlantis itself. and all i could remember about this movie was how bad it makes me feel after seeing it. the characters feel wooden and lack personality, and the drawings look a lot different than that in the first. you can tell they're obviously not from the hands of the same animators from the first one. as the dvd played on, i found myself caring less and less about what might happen to the characters and just hoping the film would end soon. besides the story and the characters mentioned above, the picture quality is poor in this one too, probably one of the worst in those direct-to-video products that disney has ever released. as a fan of the the original atlantis: the lost empire, i couldn't be more disappointed in milo's return, which is a total waste of time and money. thank goodness i rented it first instead of buying it. even so, i still wish i'd never seen this crap or even known its existence.

looking for a movie for your turkey film festival? the roller blade seven is on my list of the ten worst films of all-time. the plot, the story of a post-apocalyptic roller blading samurai warrior, is a convoluted hodge-podge of film references of everything from star wars to the seven samauri. the acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal. the scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter. frank stalone's black knight reminds one too much of john cleese's black knight in monty python and the holy grail. (word of advice, frank: when you stoop to doing a movie like this one, your career is over.) i chanced upon this little stink-bomb on a low-end cable channel and i could not stop watching. it is like watching a train wreck, you just can't look away.

this film is, far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt, the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe.it really *is* that bad.personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film, and rented this one thinking it would be one of those. to my immense disappointment, it was not.the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they're reading the lines directly off placards, the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera. i couldn't even finish watching it. it is even worse than "witch academy", and that's quite a feat in itself.i cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film, and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release.painful, awful, horrendous.

my house mate and i foolishly purchased the video of 'the roller blade seven' from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at. this film isn't even laughable, it's pathetically poor, worse even than jack frost 2-and that's saying something. the script, acting, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. in some parts the actors haven't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad-libbing or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them. set in the post apocalyptic 'wheel zone',the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film, many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad nauseum from various different camera angles to make the film longer. this gets tedious very quickly. the plot makes no sense whatsoever (it is apparently an amalgam of two books written by scott shaw), there aren't even seven of them, most of them aren't on blades, they're wearing roller boots, and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there's about 3 minutes of female semi-nudity in it. the writer and star scott shaw obviously fancies himself somewhat of a samurai and throughout the film performs some very poor stunts and made up sword fighting moves that look massively amateurish. despite all this, his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making. my house mate and i were left speechless by the whole ordeal, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape, she has decided it may be some kind of ring-esquire video curse that needs to be passed on. if you see the video in stores, take it from me! leave well alone!

a post-apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of nun and on the way meets some cyber-punks on skates who want to kick his ass. this is one of the hardest to watch films ever, there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written, badly acted line. there are action sequences that keep repeating - and we're not talking the quickfire 1-2-3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors, we're talking many, many repeats of long, bad fight sequences. this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you're watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity, the only thing thats keeps this film in the videoplayer (apart from the bet from a friend that i couldn't watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm no-one else) is the fact that although painful, this film is unintentionally hilarious, i'm not at all a fan of those "so bad that it's funny" type of films but at parts i was in tears. other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as it's obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film. final verdict - king of the "so bad they're funny" genre, anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy. also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i've ever seen.

i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a 'b-grade video night' at a friends place. despite the warnings, i was still surprised at just how bad this film was. it was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other... the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future, one in which hawk (a mad max type of character) heads off to rescue a damsel in distress. in reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life (watch the end credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh). the movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. what's even worse though is the editing of this film. the film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. i think that this was an attempt to emulate things like jean claude van-damme fight sequences, but if it is it fails utterly. the film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). i give this movie my 'worst film i've ever seen' award. i doubt that it will be topped any time soon.

you know, i was very surprised when watching this movie. it aired during the day once when i was sick, and having nothing else to do, i continued watching. this is by far the worst movie ever! but to my surprise i kept watching. i sat there saying, this is terrible, but yet didn't change the channel because i was so amused at how bad it was. maybe it was the guy that looked like big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had, that kept me watching. however, the girls weren't half bad, but if that's what you want, there is far better. oh, and there's "ninjas" and "pajama boys!"so if you like ninja's, bad acting, hilarious(and terrible) dialogue, and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. it's so bad it's good. however, i just had to give it a 1 out of ten. i couldn't have put a 10 on it up there with lord of the rings.enjoy!!!!!!!!! :)

this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film. my uncle's home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap.the plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island. the man has a very cheap paper mach√© looking hand.the acting is atrocious in this movie. there are scene changes at the drop of the hat. for instance, for at least 30 seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie. this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life, i don't think this movie could get any worse then it already is. i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong. and i hate chuck norris.

why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck. i just could not change the channel, it's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower. its pretty telling that the cast imdb "credits" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again.bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. it just goes on and on. the movie really has nothing to recommend it. if you're looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out, there are a tonne of other films that won't require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards.i hope this film didn't get money from the government for financing, otherwise i'm never paying taxes again.

i...i don't know where to begin. dragon hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history. even anus magilicutty was better than this, as it was intentionally bad. showgirls? no, it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film. but dragon hunt takes the cake, and eats it, then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man. it's that much of a travesty.the acting, if it can even be called that, is rough. it doesn't have the charm of improvised acting, so it must be scripted, but it's recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality. several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically, those people on screen) either regretted being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from saturday night live, which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera. i could write another three paragraphs on the quality of acting in this film, but you and i both don't want to hear it.the make-up and special effects (which, with most films, is the only good thing) was laughably bad. the antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous i can't remember it, has a mohawk glued to the top of his head. yeah, glued to his head. and you can tell it's glued on too, if you look at the spot where it meets his pockmarked skull you can see a plastic strip, not unlike the ones on fake eyelashes. thankfully he's pretty much the only example of make-up no-nos in the film.there's also some terrible character development, to put it lightly. the women, who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly benevolent fugly brothers (and i mean, they are really pushed around), are not only ugly but...gasp...they don't know what they're doing! in one scene they turn on their apparent lovers, join up with the even uglier bad guy, and then snort some coke. apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine, because they started shaking and laughing even before all of it went up their nostrils. great timing girls! plus they wear some truly horrible stuff, clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s.overall this movie, this film, this waste of film i should say, is also a waste of time. watching it will hurt you, and will require the suspension of not only your belief, but also of your entire brain. if you want to get stoned with your friends and have some good laughs, see if you can get this film (you'll probably have to download it) otherwise, don't even think about it. hope i was helpful.

this canadian "movie" is the worst ever! stunningly amateurish. when the bad guys rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says, with a very low voice, "we're robbing your ship!" she blinks and is totally shy! very intimidating. rotflol!!!the two karate chopping heroes are 40something year old, five feet tall twin brothers! they're really bad actors. in fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-actor.there are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it's amazing. in one scene, the guys are wearing one type of swimsuit. in the following shot, they're wearing completely different swimsuits. absolutely terrible! a must see for any fan of bad movies. i have it on vhs. it's very rare. i cherish it.

everything about this movie is bad. everything. ridiculous 80's haircuts. ridiculous moustaches. ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can actually see that the adversaries do not even hit each other. bad, bad, bad 80's music. repeated scenes of people running through woods. a bad guy with a silver plastic hand and silly hair. stupid dialogue. the acting is nonexistant. everything looks extremely cheap. this movie even surpasses "plan 9 from outer space" in its utter badness.it's not "funny bad" it's just bad.

i have never watched a movie that frustrated me more than lord of the dance. frustrated because it could have been fantastic. frustrated because the dancing might have been astounding. frustrated because the women could have been gorgeous. how would i know though?! by the time your eyes have moved to the area of interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired the insane editor has moved the shot! i completely agree with the other comments here about the crappy lighting and terrible camera/editor work. it makes me nauseous just watching ten minutes of this would be spectacular movie.give me an opportunity to get a front seat to the live concert and i would be there in a shot! nicholas t

i can't really remember any details of this movie except that the setting looked awfully familiar. then i realized it was filmed at the lazy lizard hostel in moab, utah. that was one of my favorite places to visit when i was younger and wandered around the country. the guy who owns/manages the hostel managed to get himself in the movie. all i remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women. it is great to watch just for the scenery (i mean the rock formations)... if you are just looking for soft-core porn, you will probably be better served elsewhere. i don't even know if this movie is available on tape or dvd.

ken harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a road accident. end of story."end of story", that is, in the sense of "end of any physical action". not in the sense of "end of the film". ken's life is saved, but he is paralysed from the neck down. when he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive. the rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die.ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, michael emerson. although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, here it is presented in purely secular ones. if dr emerson has any deep religious convictions, these are never expressed in the film. he believes passionately, however, that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight; to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty. ken therefore finds himself in a "catch-22" situation. he must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. emerson, however, considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality. ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital.richard dreyfuss as ken and john cassavetes as dr emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity, but this cannot hide the fact that "whose life is it anyway?" simply does not work as a film. at one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. when plays were filmed, therefore, the general tendency was to "open them up" by filming on location as well as on studio sets, by taking liberties with the playwright's text, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters.i have never seen brian clarke's play, but i suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema. there is very little physical action; most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed. such a plot does not lend itself to the "opening up" device at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by talk at the expense of action. although it is well written and there is some good acting, i am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject. 4/10

this is just art house rubbish. i sat watching this trash with my bosnian friends they found it as boring as i did. for a more interesting and more true account watch the excellent movie saviour. this is just a snoozefest with people talking in coffee shops.a cure for insomnia. 1 out of 10

skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location. they get drunk every night. they smuggle opium. they drop pigs in parachutes. they fly under impossibly hazardous conditions. they dress weird and act weirder. they're iconoclastic, outrageous. they violate every rule of command and have contempt for their employers at the cia. they're irreplaceable.nope. it's not "only angels have wings" and it's not "m*a*s*h." it's an uneasy mixture of the two that unfortunately comes across as more silly than funny.it aims at shock, amusement, and education, but doesn't really achieve its goals.as far as its shock value is concerned, well, we're inured by now, aren't we? does it really shock anyone that a bunch of hard-living pilots flew secret missions in laos in the 1970s? no, it's not shocking. it's not even educational now, under our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that some paramilitary excursion was not buried in a file labeled national interest, defense de toucher. that's okay. so we've been wised up a little and are no longer neither so shockable nor so dumb.the problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to amuse. without that, the film implodes. a group of shaggy drunken cia pilots are sitting around in a cat house, goosing the girls, shooting out the lights with a silenced pistol, killing lizards with same. asks newbie pilot robert downey, jr., "when you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate?" replies another, guffawing, "no, it means it's night time." that might be funny if we expected renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. if we don't, the gag, like the movie, falls flat.there are action scenes naturally. everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight. people fall out of them, baggage is thrown haphazardly out of their hatches, engines fail, they sustain damage from aaa, the are torn apart during crash landings, but we've seen most of this elsewhere, often done better.some might find this funnier than i did, and the acting is pretty good. robert downey jr. is especially effective as the straight man. check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing, then by all means watch it. there might be some laughs in it that escaped me.

prior to airport 79' these movies were rather good. they had decent special effects, all-star cast, and good acting. this movie destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for it. lets talk about the special effects wow!!!! they are horrific, what was the director thinking about. i know it's only 1979, but lets look at other very good special effects movies such as star wars(1977),and moonraker(1979). i like the idea of the concord and this could of been the best airport movie, but they did too much with it. how about joe patroni(george kennedey) shooting a flare out of the cockpit window, to prevent a heat seeking missile from hitting the concord. also he is doing 90 degree dives and loops. this completely far fetched, and unrealistic wow!!!!!! believe me the special effects don't help this scene, and really are beyond poor.... they almost look like a cartoon, and this is how the whole movie is!!!finally lets talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor to fair at best.... over acting is a major issue in this movie, especially george kennedy.. which i really like as an actor, but just doesn't cut in this movie. the full blame has to go on the director, who did a very poor editing job, and really whacked out the airport franchise. too bad the concord isn't still used today it was a marvel of air travel...

this final installment of the "airport" franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy, like "airplane". george kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical. what would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed? you'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. the passengers were unintentionally hilarious, as was the interior of the plane. the sophisticated french woman coming on to slobby george kennedy was like jackie kennedy coming on to ernest borgnine. ain't gonna happen. susan blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, did not get any points on her resume for this one. neither did robert wagner. this movie was so lousy it seemed surreal.

this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen, it did not left out a single clichee one could imagine about a hollywood-so-called-thriller. the protagonist is a loving father & a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: finding out if a suspected "snuff" movie is real.certainly, he get's involved deeper & deeper, smeary pornoshops (run by mexicans) & sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the "snuff" movie. assisted by a "smart" (he read a book) sexshop employee, he's catching up with a murderous bondage-film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film... ...and what do you expect? they are portrayed as the simple evil, no need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad ones, and he's the purifier. boom. killer of the killers. end of film. is it that bad? yes, i'm afraid so.ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert who did the killing) is even pointing at his ridiculous character: in the last scene, our hero forces "machine" to put off his leather mask (yep, of course he's wearing one) and recognizes that "machine" looks just like the normal 08/15 guy from the street. then "machine" says: "blablabla i'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, i had a nice childhood, i just love to do what i do!"i just love to kill people. yeah, sure, "everybody loves killing people" (bender). it's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring, it's also it's ugly "i have to kill these people"-attitude which makes you sick. in one scene, our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him...but he can't. so what does he do? he calls the mother of the killed woman, says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead. the mother cries yes, she'd love her child, he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him.to come to the point: this film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob-supporters (certainly the police does not play any role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot. probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even that would be too much plot.don't waste your time with this.

there is nothing good to say about this movie. read revolution for the hell of it or any of his other writings. abbie was often dismissed as the clown-prince of the '60's, but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness, his sense of humor and pop culture, and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas. the media too often concentrated on the man, not the ideas, and that's the problem with this movie, too. later in his life he did suffer from depression. but this flick is like a national enquirer version of abbie. he deserves better. if you don't know abbie or his times, this movie won't help. this film lies. i give it a zero. 

want a great recipe for failure? take a crappy, leftist political plot, add in some weak & completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known. let stew for a week (the amount of time probably spent making this trash).the result is 'steal this movie,' a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived.this movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time. words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. this is not 'plan 9 from outer space.' this is a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'steal this movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen. it depresses me when i realize that people *actually* took time out of their lives to act in this tripe, if you can call it "acting." but then again, when you have poor direction, poor writing, poor everything - "acting" is the last thing to criticize.this movie is like a huge, disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence, fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. thank you, robert greenwald, for giving me newfound respect for every other movie i have ever seen. you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and/or boring.

the trouble with this film, like so many other films that fail, is the script.the script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place. what is the story here? ok, it's a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into 100 or so minutes. some selection and editing is required but this script just didn't select or edit enough. it didn't render hoffman's life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and, through them, 'get' the bigger picture of the whole man.the movie wanders from being a straight plodding 'troubled genius' biopic, to semi-docu/mocu-mentary (using new shots faked up to match archive footage), to sub true life sob stories movie of the week (the whole "i'm bringing up a son who doesn't know i'm his dad" shtick), to political conspiracy theory movie etc. etc. it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be, and the half-hearted citizen kane like narrative structure (reporter interviewing people from hoffman's past) is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts out.the movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important. the whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after vincent d'onofrio pounds the window screaming "i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman!" ("i'm acting! i'm acting! i'm acting!") could have easily been cut. all that happens is the psychiatrist says "you have bipolar disorder here's some lithium.", and the two women in his life say "we could see you weekends more often." and bang! that's it. no more mental health problems. it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily, and should, have been dumped before it was shot. the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god? pointless. tells us nothing about anything. yet, when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust, the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesn't make any sense to the audience. suddenly he's dealing in heroin? where did this come from? why? what is going on here? i, being a middle-aged leftie, would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of 'the man', 'the pigs', 'the fuzz' etc. as brutal, be-suited, unthinking, hippie-hating androids. it may have been like that in 60's america, i don't know, i wasn't there, but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemic.having said all that vincent d'onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything, even reading a bus timetable, though she just wasn't right for this part.

let me start out by saying that i am a huge fan of abbie hoffman and have read steal this book and steal this urine test. also am a even bigger jerry rubin fan. but his movie was a discusting pile of rubbish that made a very pg version of abbie hoffman. the director took no chances into making abbie hoffman interesting in this movie. they despicted stew albert as a f***ing cartoon chjaractor devoid of intellegence, the man was a proffesor at berkley for christsakes. ok they did a horrid casting job for anita hoffman, did a horrible job casting for the jerry rubin character. i just guess the movie doesnt fit the news flashes that i have seen of abbie or the books that he wrote. the movie just didnt fit and upset me. oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice over i have ever heard of richard nixon. this is one of the few movies that i have ever rented that i could not sit all the way through because, i have a passion for abbie hoffman and his discruntled band of yippies and this movie was just plain badly done. and it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the yippies they will see a terrible adaptation, and not get a true sense of reality. instead they get a hollywoodized palanthra of crap.

this film plays like a demented episode of vh1's "where are they now", or "behind the music". in the first half of the movie (that depict his "glory days") abbie hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star. you know the kind; the poseur lead singer, the pretty boy, who didn't write any of the music, doesn't have a clue, but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free. consequently he takes his success for granted, abuses it, and ultimately destroys it along with himself. indeed hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when he was busted for dealing cocaine, skipped bail, and went into hiding. the second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding. in it we see hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone, anyone, but himself for his downfall. eventually the times pass him by completely; and he can never to come to grips with that. how sad. the end. end credits roll and oh no! we learn that abbie hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989.i'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for hoffman in making this movie. given that tom hayden and gerald lefcourt were involved, i'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all, an icon of the 60's and of the left's anti-war movement. in this they have failed miserably. the film presents abbie hoffman as a mindless caricature. we are never told about what drives him. how did he arrive at his views? how did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? how did he organize such a vast movement? why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine? why? who knows, and since the filmmakers don't seem to, ultimately who cares?

this fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points, it's badly made, has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem i have with it is the basic premise.this film uses the idea that h.p. lovecraft has traveled to italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed. i'm willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to italy (only for suspension of disbelieve) but that some of his work is based on reality and that insmouth exist is total nonsense.first of all, lovecraft didn't believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters where there to show that humans weren't so special after all. another myth used in this film is that lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he wasn't, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources.so we end up with a film about people jelling at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love for horror.after seeing the film frankenstein lovecraft said that he felt sorry for mary shelley because he felt that her work was butchered. i feel sorry for lovecraft.

so many of these types of movies out these days. this zombie flick falls into the major "cheese" category unlike the far more polished dawn of the dead, and day of the dead. in all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them. but they were also good movies. a low budget movie can still be good if only they would stop accepting and using the worst scripts around. whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk the whole time.this movie had so so special effects and a very un-even plot line. the one major difference from other movies of its type is the time it takes for people to transform into zombies. in this one, it seems to take just seconds for them to die and then turn into a zombie. yet with the ease this "infection" spreads you can have zombie blood all over you and not even seem to be at risk for infection, and believe me the people in this one get covered in blood.the main problem i had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and didn't get bit. when everybody else turns into zombies amazingly quickly these 2 were swarmed by zombies when they were even unarmed and were able to come out of it without a problem. our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. i was laughing out load at that point. unarmed, having like 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building yet she manages to get out without a scratch? ok sure....also whoever advised these people on how special forces behaves obviously never spent any time in the military. they should have watched a movie like blackhawk down first to get at least an idea of how they behave in combat situations.one soldier was a fat overweight special forces private. lol that was a good one. another kept going up to zombies thinking they were survivors, even putting his weapon down at one point. these guys are in there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers from the movie stripes. special forces, lol...then they get to the point at which they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing. the explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie. it made no sense at all.the only thing i liked was the anti bush jokes. the military lady at the beginning told them that the order came down from the vice president to the president and at the end it was the vice president from an "undisclosed location" giving the orders. that was the best part of the movie for me.

a college professor is working on creating zombies and, wouldn't you know it, things go horribly wrong. next thing you know, the whole campus is overrun. thank goodness there's a pair of uber-commandos trained for just such a situation. too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moron-commandos, lead by a rapper (he doesn't even bother trying to play a military guy, he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin' wit' da homies in da hood). the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene. the male and female moron-commandos share the same locker room, and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties. hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in their underwear. my hat's off to the film makers.so, after much discussion of how well prepared these moron-commandos are for the job (bosnia, afghanistan, iraq), they all get killed off in fairly short order. their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on. a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end. human or zombie? can't tell. flip on the lights? no, moron-commando protocol requires them to walk up to the person, making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand, and well, you know the drill. the demise of sergeant major sticky fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie i've ever seen. luckily (and again, hats off to the filmmakers), the hottest babe among the moron-commandos manages to survive. her and the female uber-commando both wind up in tight t-shirts for the remainder of the movie. now this is how a military operation should be performed! there's a bunch of running around, punctuated my humorous stuff like the uber-commandos being unable to get through a simple ventilator grating (it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through). this necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves, and even though we've seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell, they're good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes go.a few other funny bits - the paris hilton gag, the "can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters, main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on. another chuckle is provided by mr. fingaz, who can't seem to pronounce the word 'tourniquet' (toe-no-kit?).overall, it's somewhat amusing. could have used some more interesting characters, but for a sci-fi channel original, i was mildly impressed.

ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings. this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door. compared to datd the effects are vastly superior. however the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" consistently verge on the moronic. i feel like trying out uwe boll's latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd2. i am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. ok there it is. i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2.

ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked! the zombie make up was extremely fake! the acting is very poor! and it doesn't really follow the first one! while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this. i would say catch it on tv, don't spend your money on it! its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list. i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again! the plot was pointless, i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die. they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying. if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner. with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give it a 2.

oh man, where to even begin.....dropping your gun to get in hand to hand combat w/ a zombie, while holding a bitten soldier down debating to shoot him b4 he turns, then he turns and bites the person holding him down, turning your back on a "fallen" zombie, continuously shooting the chest and seeing it doesn't work, so they shoot the chest some more, having the idea that a kid slumped at a desk w/ blood coming out of his mouth is still alright, walking along a football field like nothing is wrong then all the sudden noticing the zombie football team doing whatever in the middle of the field like they couldn't have been seen up to that point....i could go one for a few more hours, but you get the point.....childish writing and dialog, bad directing, horrid special effects, truly sad and undeveloped storyline (zombie infested campus, must get the viral host then lose it....twice), the only plus i can find is that this one doesn't include clips of the actual game during the "action scenes"....id say don't waste your money, but id be more upset about the waste of time, i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back

i will keep it to bullet points so here goes: 1. very badly scripted. 2. tries to be like resident evil. 3. zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute raging lunatics. 4. never saw blood clean up so easily! 5. special effects not as good as the original "day of the living dead". 6. acting not as good as the "bold and the beautiful". 7. it looks like it was written in 1 week and made the next week.basicaly med team plus special forces go into a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. all die except the 2 main stars so predictable even though unarmed and swarmed with 100s of zombies they survived. however special forces (who were trained at kindergarten school scouts) only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons. also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps. overall load of rubbish.

isn't it strange how crap-movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like: "boy, this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before"? it's pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high ¬ñ or even remotely positive - expectations, as "house of the dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released. the abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director michael hurst, as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of its predecessor. and exactly how embarrassing must this be for uwe boll, huh? having to acknowledge that a straight-to-video sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation? in case anyone still doubts: no, "house of the dead 2: dead aim" isn't a good horror movie at all but, yes: it's definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you're looking for an undemanding splatter film with loads of gory butchering, sleaze and stupid humor. there's no real connection with the events in the first film (another advantage) and this part two opens like a typically rancid sex comedy set in a college campus. the male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house, inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with enormous breasts, but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor (sid haig!) who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie. this is the beginning of a quickly spreading and deadly epidemic but, no worries, as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists & soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood samples for an antidote. hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they even named them hyper sapiens, but their constantly increasing amount eventually endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers. director hurst thankfully found his inspiration in the more eminent classics of the genre, like james cameron's "aliens" and ¬ñ of course - george a. romero's dead-trilogy, particularly "day of the dead". he luckily also didn't made the same mistakes as uwe boll, who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie (why?!?) and *slightly* exaggerated with the use of cgi-techniques. hotd 2 contains heavy images of violence, like chopped up female corpses and detailed amputations, but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking. naturally, there's isn't the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror clich√© features here as well. the film is very enjoyable as long as story writer mark altman doesn't try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics. they're walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls, so we really don't need to know what caused their deaths. especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly hasn't got a clue what all the medical terms mean. just avoid getting bitten, sweetheart.

i am furious! it has been a while since the last zombie movie i've watched so i was really looking forward to watching a good ol' gory zombie movie. hotd2 was a major disappointment. a reasonable story but awful acting, filming, dialogue, and nauseating clich√©s and punch lines. i didn't even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one...now i am curious about how bad could that one have been! the film is full of mistakes and goofs. who on earth analyses dna using a blood sample!? why are these "special forces" who "have been to hell and back" fight like spoiled 6 year old girls? we see ferocious zombies who would take a bite at any chance they get then hundreds of them that wave their arms at our two "heroes", take them down to the ground, then let them go without even a scratch. i could go on and on about this but life is too short and i have already wasted a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the movie industry.

when one of the stars of a movie is named sticky fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. stay away. house 2 is just more of the same, this time with zombies overrunning a college campus (man, how that must have saved on money). as usual, the "zombies" are given no direction so speak of, and provided very little makeup or costuming. they look like the zombies in one of those endless italian zombie cheapies from years ago. which is to say, they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from george romero and dan o'bannon zombie flicks. the folks battling the zombies are all nonactors who get to shoot guns and do little else. some who have written here feel the sequel is slightly more focused than the original. all i have to say is i'm glad the sequel's director did away with the 360-degree pan shots that helped to ruin the first movie. house 2 is still just more of the same, which means a lot of nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. there is one set piece, involving soldiers tussling with a zombie football team, that might at least have been funny. it's not.

i used to work in a video store. i saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night.this movie was truly awful, there is no redeeming quality about it, because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it. if the first film wasn't low budget enough then this film truly takes the biscuit, being housed (mostly) indoors and at night...therefore avoiding the scenic cost setting of the first film in the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically runs over an attractive student. rather than be mortified, the lecturer half heartedly apologises and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars bonnet (he sped up as he approached her) that there is nothing to worry about...after which he attacks her with a crowbar and kills her! if this isn't strange enough, he wants to perform an experiment upon her, bringing her back from the dead....and so feels the need to remove her clothing to do so.soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) is rampant throughout the film and is, to be honest,the only real thing to hold the average male viewers interest...like the swimming scene in the first film...but even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting, crappy dialogue and absurd plot turns....why introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes....its just a very very bad film

if you haven't seen the first one you have to at least know someone who has and you have to know it was painful to sit through. there just wasn't anything good to say about it at all. so what's different with the second one? why bother making a sequel for a movie that was wretched? this one doesn't take itself too seriously. it knows it was made for tv and doesn't try to impress with great or serious dialogue. there are moments where it tries to get 'serious' or 'intense' but these moments are so corny you have to laugh.thankfully gone are any elements of uwe boll and any hint that this originated from a video game (other than the title of course). don't go into this movie expecting anything worth mentioning to your friends unless they're into camp, lame zombie movies, or are interested in making a drinking game out of this movie. take two shots whenever ed quinn's character mentions his dead brother! take one shot whenever a bullet would have been better place in the head of a zombie instead of pumping three in the chest! etc etc.

so lame it isn't even funny. a zombie infection overtakes a small college campus and a government squad of secret operatives back up a couple of scientists sent to find the origin of the outbreak. collecting zombie dna damn sure is not easy. once bitten you're one of "them". the entire university has been completely infected by the run amok undead.this sequel does not even redeem the awful original house of the dead(2003). senseless entertainment is accomplished though. a few glimpses of female nakedness added to a gaggle of gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie freak happy. credited cast members: emmanuelle vaugier, victoria pratt, ed quinn, sid haig and nadine velazquez. the "f" word holds together an unimaginative script.

terrible, boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than uwe's horrible first film. it consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection. these soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out(or at least aren't very interesting)so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of. the film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter. it even has the same munching on guts. it just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory. and, the story's climax is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous. one wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bit(for they are the main stars who seem to always manage escapability)while others seem to get bit rather easily. the film sole motivation is to show people getting bit..nothing else. just go watch a romero film for lasting effect.

i can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie. instead of setting up scenes in a creative way he relies on boring old zombie clich√©s.where the two unarmed leads have to get down the college steps into the van he surrounds them with zombies yet neither of the leads is bitten. he can't be bothered to direct a decent fight scene so we see the leads shove their way down the steps.sometimes the zombies limp about and at others they run like the wind. this is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without bothering with continuity in the behaviour of the zombies.with careful planning and a lot more inspiration this movie could have been so much better.

how bad can you make a film. a good question which house of the dead 2 succeeds in answering. i could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first house of the dead but amazingly the director has succeeded. the only feeling you get from the film is that its bad, just bad. what with overacting, bad fx and a stupid story. its this kind of movie which gives a bad name to z-movies in general. why could they not learn the lesson from the first house of the dead movie? anyway i guess you will have understood by now that you should not see this film. it is but a waste of time. watch "bad taste" or "dawn of the dead" if you want to see some good zombies.

"house of the dead 2: dead aim" (2005) is the sequel, though you really don't need to see the first "house of the dead" to get this film. that said, the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects and it's edited quite nicely, with very effective sound design. however, that said, that's about all that's good here.the story and script are awful . . . there's blatant plot holes everywhere. it's also funny how the soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces (unlike in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will infect you). also realistic how there's little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual us military discipline.a 4 out of 10.

this is one of the most awful movies i've had the misfortune of picking up. don't get me wrong, i love a good zombie flick, but this wasn't one of them....might as well (from the opening scenes, at least) been called 'titty zombies from outer space'. it had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game (as far as i could tell.) the best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can get covered with so much blood and remain so nonplussed. i would certainly suggest giving this one and miss and staying with a safer zombie pleaser like '28 days later' or 'dawn of the living dead' (the remake, of course, unless you're into some serious campy action.)

i'm sorry, but they did leave the impression that these commandos fought zombies before. but they sure didn't act like they even seen a zombie before. jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs. second, the characters are pretty badly written. the actors did the best they could with what was given, i blame bad writing and bad directing. lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are highest. they loose the sample twice and the girl jennifer holland doesn't know if she's been bit or not. how stupid is that? as much as it hurts to be bitten, one would think you would know, plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue. dumb, the first movie had it's flaws but it has re-watchablity, unlike this disaster of a movie, which i could barely get through once. i give the house of the dead 2: no guts, all stupidity the crap-o-lantern

when uwe boll, cinema con man extraordinaire, released the first house of the dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel. hollywood's per-capita ratio of morons must indeed be high, for not only do we have a sequel, it was distributed in the antipodes by sony, a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write-offs. released direct to television in america, the sequel does improve on the original in most respects, but in so doing, it becomes bland rather than interesting. the scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. in particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected denizens can be found. put simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found.the cast, on the other hand, is a real step backward. emmanuelle vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low-rent angelina jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it j√ºrgen prochnow. in fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is one sticky fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people he faces at home. put simply, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. say what you will about boll, but he at least inspired actors like ona grauer to fight against his ineptitude. that said, the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it. much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. unfortunately, with the actors failing to take their characters or the predicament seriously, what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined.much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. how this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyone's guess, but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own. the we-have-to-go-back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time, but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. we are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes drive back into the university, locate the sample they are looking for, and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of china, all in this space of time. filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension.the special effects used in house of the dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust. where uwe boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, michael hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow. necks are bitten, arms are cut off, heads are shot. it all makes for a much more convincing throughput, but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery. the photography is also much improved. as dvd crypt put it, the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original, but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. the writing is also both an improvement and a setback. throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious being run like hell, are offered. the first couple of times, they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary, everyday dialogue. after the eighth time, however, they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time.interestingly, house of the dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across america. given that tom savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays, i have to say i am somewhat impressed with the visual results. in contrast to the much-reviled original, the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. in a further contrast to the original, the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing. sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people. however, the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already. when aliens, the real dawn of the dead, or the evil dead were released to acclaim, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before, or did it so well that we did not really care. house of the dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it, but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table, so we end up not caring either.for that reason, and many others, i gave house of the dead 2 a two out of ten. it is too good to be bad, but too bad to be any good. unless you are into sucky films as much as i am, you are best to steer clear of it.

i saw the first house of the dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend, so when it wasn't as bad as that, i was delightfully surprised.unfortunately, i then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well...and i was wrong.apparently i'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad.i don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw, or wonder if i saw the wrong movie.ed quinn as ellis and emmanuelle vaugier as alexandra 'nightingale' morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them. they deserve to be in better movies.the special effects were okay and some of the characters likable/hate-able and that made for a tolerable watch, but for the most part, this movie was just a waste of time.oh and i have to ask this because i found myself asking it aloud all the way through the movie...did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms? only once did it happen, (zombies wandering in) and i found that a little convenient...soldiers walk into a room, leave the door wide open, pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it (with the hapless "livings" being cornered with no way to escape) and yet only once did zombies follow them in.nitpicky? maybe but honestly...if i was fighting for my life, the last thing i'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me.that is really the only thing *bothered* me throughout the movie, and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original.

i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that. the first one i saw, bloodrayne, was not a complete loss. i liked it more than most people, and actually rated it a 4 out of 10. next up was the first house of the dead movie. now that was horrifically bad. i could stand watching ten minutes of it, and fast-forwarding a bit, and that was it. i could see where it was going and i didn't need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10.but i had access to the sequel, too (which however is not by uwe boll, but, mysteriously, written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first one), and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original, i thought i'd give it a chance. and i actually managed to watch all of it. it started out with some funny references and cool lines (like how the president got his orders from the vice-president!), and acting-wise it is light-years better than the first. here we have cool muchachas like the ultra-hot emmanuelle vaugier, whose coolness is in league with carrie-anne moss, claudia black and evangeline lilly. man, i hope some matrix-style movie comes along for her sometime. and the always delectable, super-aerobicized victoria pratt. i love athletic women. and, there was also nadine velazquez (catalina on "my name is earl"), who performed quite well.the story wasn't much, and the action wasn't great, either, and the ending was a disappointment, as they didn't succeed in their mission. oh well, at least the two mains survived. guess that's some small victory, too.good cast, but a pretty bad movie. the actors make it watchable, but there's no real substance there.3 out of 10.

granted, hotd 2 is better than the uwe boll crapfest that was the first one, but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive. ok ok, i'm being a little bit harsh with this one, its just that video game adaptations of zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. resident evil was alright, but its sequels are pure rubbish. the first hotd was entertaining crap more than anything else; uwe boll saw to that. and hotd 2 was...better? the entertainment value was there, the hot chicks were there, the gore was there, but... this is it? the script, even though subpar, was better than the first one. but in the script dwells horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clich√©s, and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of ridiculousness which would make the bollmeister very, very proud. but, it could've been worse right?hotd 2 stars sig haig (yes, sid haig) as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death. as you may guess, it all goes to sh*t. a nearby college campus seems to be the center for the zombie (or hypersapien?) epidemic, and as you may expect, a group of commandos and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. their main goal? no, it ain't blowing sh*t up. instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a cure to the deadly virus. between this and that lays bland character interactions, an insufferable amount of clich√©s (but hey, at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed), and decent looking zombies. the acting is passable. who would've thought that sticky fingaz was a passable actor? not me. emmanuelle vaugier and ed quinn shine somewhat as the leads. and the supporting cast was passable too. it was all passable. the make up effects on the zombies were alright, it could've been worse like in the first hotd: just guys running around in dusty mummy suits. the gore was alright too. cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non-existent in this movie, which is a good thing. the action sequences were stupid as f*ck, but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. overall, this movie will appeal only to zombie enthusiasts, fans of the arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending, but i wouldn't count on it. unless uwe decides to do it. a 4.

this movie definitely made me laugh but that doesn't mean it was exactly funny. well, then again, me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it.i doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. all of the characters are overused movie clich√© cardboard-box roles that don't even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not delivered. we have the corrupt cop, a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families whilst caring nothing about people he shoots in the forehead at so close a range as to have blood spat on his face. we have the "worn-out cop on the edge" so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie; we have the old one-day-away-from-retirement-cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside, since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a trustworthy word throughout the movie. about as see-through as a glass house on a sunny day. the big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history (they could've just called him marcellus wallace), but just slightly tougher and more ruthless, because something has to emphasize that we also know laurence fishburne from actually good movies. then we finally have the highly educated doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from her ordinary life and who spends the majority of the movie sitting in a corner helplessly trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon she was given. not using it.the whole siege story is not interesting, not original (having been used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it. there is the initial probe, then the laying of the siege, then the assault, then the escape attempts. meanwhile a bunch of strained, stressed, freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold off a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the quite important advantage of vision. then again, in deep night, with the power cut and with a snow storm raging overhead, there is definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision.but the best part comes right at the end. in the first scenes showing precinct 13, we see it is situated in an outskirt of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. from this point, the besieged walk maybe a hundred meters in a sewer and where do they end up? some alley ending right in the middle of a forest! a forest! where did that forest come from? who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? how is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively flat?? from here i leave the judgment to you, and to your common sense. go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh, i can really recommend it.

i probably have to blame myself¬Öbut i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title "black dragons" and revolves on secret wwii conspiracies, nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. this film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. the actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. we see how horror icon bela lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent american politicians and kills them one by one. the story is timed right before wwii and ¬ñ especially after witnessing the ending ¬ñ it surely is a premise with lots of potential, so it's quite a shame it isn't elaborated more proper. there is however one great dialogue that i can't resist sharing! man towards woman: "do you want to marry me?" "why?" "so i can beat you up¬Öit's the only way you'll leave this place!" it's the only highlight in an overall very boring movie. bela lugosi is lovely ¬ñ as usual ¬ñ but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film. if you're interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his (in movies with decent screenplays), check out "invisible ghost", "the corpse vanishes", "white zombie" and of course the 1931 dracula version.

this was a strange film. a bit horror and certainly film noir. some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously start dying off with a japanese dagger in their hands after monsieur colomb (bela lugosi) shows up.soon the lone ranger arrives in the person of fbi agent richard 'dick' martin (clayton moore). martin is ineffective in finding the killer as he is more interested in the niece (joan barclay) of a missing doctor, who is part of the gang.after the last man dies, and the doctor is horribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and that is where it gets interesting and weird. i won't spill it.lugosi was marvelous as the skulking killer.

"black dragons" is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time. it's not as bad as some would have you believe. a secret meeting hosted by the respected dr. william saunders (george pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names monsieur colomb (bela lugosi). shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese embassy in washington. colomb is suspected. federal agent dick martin (clayton moore) is assigned to the case and meets saunders niece alice saunders (joan barclay) who tries to assist him. the reasons behind colomb's actions are not explained until the final reel. until all is explained at the end, the story is hard to comprehend.  lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies, is actually quite good in this one. he is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director william nigh. lugosi's character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes. clayton moore, a one dimensional actor at best, would become tv's lone ranger in a few years. joan barclay makes a good heroine. although a little dated now, "black dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.

this film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. the pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for bela lugosi). the audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. if these things bother you at all, don't watch this film.if you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one. a german plastic surgeon (bela lugosi) was hired by the japanese to operate on several japanese agents and turn them into the likenesses of upstanding american businessmen whom the japanese have kidnapped and killed. after completing his work, he was betrayed by the japanese and thrown into prison. he later escapes and travels to america to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly-publicized murders.it seemed as though bela lugosi was the only decent actor in the film, and, to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy. the leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned to her case was the common, chauvinistic and always correct dominant male that is found in many films of this time period. i also found that the camera work was completely uninspired, often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again. after a while, this tends to drag the film down, setting a very slow pace for the "action," which is more or less non-existent anyway.to me, the idea is a fascinating one, and with a better writer, director, script, equipment, and actors it could become an excellent film. sadly, these handicaps keep the film back for now, and i can't recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers.

poor bela lugosi. just another day at work. a group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the american war effort from the inside. it's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. there are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. a police force that doesn't know what is going on. what a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. there are comments like, "a true patriot would do this or that." it's obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldn't know a spy or a subversive if it jumped up and bit them. i also was surprised to see clayton moore (the lone ranger) in a romantic role. i never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse. there is, of course, the smugness of the criminals as they think that they are immune from the killer's guest list. anyway, bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one. the best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil it. as a curiosity, and a period piece, it may be fun to watch for some people.

mgm hodgepodge of jimmy durante throwing a big party for everybody in hollywood. no major stars show up--we get the three stooges, laurel & hardy, durante and lupe velez. i didn't recognize anyone else--they were probably unknowns (for good reason). the movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography. the only things that save this from being a total disaster are laurel & hardy's "battle" with lupe velez and a wonderful color disney cartoon called "the hot chocolate soldier". it's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost. otherwise, the movie is a colossal bore. there's no director credited--what does that tell you?

i wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to european wimps and the united nations. what a load of right-wing crud! incidentally, the bit about canada joining the us didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. the only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for president(but they could have just made him american and dispensed with that). in any event, this was a load of bull and not worth your time. if you wan't to see this kind of thing done well, check out the brilliant bbc political thriller "state of play."

no spoiler needed to steer you clear of this...well, bizarre film. canada becomes part of the usa. ok. so, i guess i'm unusual, but i expected something about the implications of canada becoming part of the usa. silly me. continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land. the opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will (trust me) not care a squat for any of the characters. slings and arrows and due south have to be among the most imaginative series ever. but in this case, paul gross, i'm so very sorry to say, didn't have a clue about making a coherent film and wasted a lot of talented actors in the process. a real disappointment.

there could be some spoilers ahead but i doubt it. i have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. it's horrible. completely unwatchable. i hung in there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and just couldn't stand it anymore. i was an elijah wood fan in the '90s (see "the war") and i learned to enjoy mandy moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see "chasing liberty" which is surprisingly entertaining). i've seen bits of "run lola run." so with three leads i liked this should have been fine. it wasn't. nobody turned in a good performance. wood's jones was flat. for an aspiring writer he had next to no imagination (his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from "a christmas story" and his lustful ones were--huh, a cross between boring and alarming). potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and i'd only know that she was supposed to be "the girl" by reading the box. speaking of the synopsis--whoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny, quirky, romantic, and quite enjoyable. whoever that person was, he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script. by the halfway point, i didn't care about any of the characters anymore. moore's lisa is an aspiring actress who's bubbly and a little conniving (for no apparent reason at all) but her ludicrous period play (which is supposed to be funny in presentation) is on a par with the rest of the script. there is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy ending to this turkey--given the character material they had to work with, i just can't envision it. save your money. warn your friends. don't watch this movie.

i found this movie to be a complete waste of 96 minutes. jones was a weird kid and is severly messed up! according to my memory which might be wrong, wasnt he only 16 or 17 years old? **spoiler** why did he leave college and rent an apartment with a two crazy girls who feud over boys for a pasttime? and the cowboy who lives underneath jones creeped me out too, how he knew what happened in the apartments didnt float past me for a minute. i do not understand his thinking about the girl that took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when mandy moore was always over and is was quite obvious that she wanted to be more than friends with him. i dont really find this movie funny or artsy or dramatic or anything, i found it to be stupid and a complete waste of time (d- f+)

having loved stephen king's novels and short stories for many years, i, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works. a few notable exceptions are "stand by me" from "the body", "carrie" from the novel of the same name, and "the shawshank redemption" from "rita heyworth and shawshank redemption". this movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with stephen king's name attached to it in any way. it is no surprise that mr. king has pretty much disavowed any connection with it. i feel the thing that most offended me about this poorly acted, cheaply filmed, hideously directed piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to completely change the ending don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow-wow of a movie!!

the first word i can find to describe this movie is awful.this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. first of all is the plot a very thin plot (wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. this makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. one of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: what the hell are the kids doing in that corn!!!!!!!!!! thirdly is the characters very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. they are bad as they can be.the last thing that make this movie bad, is that its a horror movie. you are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you are not scared, you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen.conclusion: the movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! i hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary, the movie is best unseen.

a traveling couple (horton and hamilton)stumble onto the town of gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they're separated and peter horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of king's best short stories. in the original story king managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful. also the effective ending used in the story is in favor dumped for a happy ending which makes the overall impact mute. there is some atmosphere and stylish directing but no plot to back any of it up. the kids are woefully unconvincing also.1/5 matt bronson

i'm sorry, but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi classic and a scary movie, but seriously, i think when the director has me laughing unintentionally, that's not a good thing. the characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable. i just couldn't stop laughing at issac's voice, it was just like a high pitched whiny girl's british voice. not to mention malicai's over dramatic stick up his butt character.children of the corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a god that commands them to sacrifice any 20+ aged people. when a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help, but of course they get caught in the kid's trap and are getting sacrificed! but malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following issac's orders.children of the corn could've been something great, but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of. as much as i love stephen king, i'm sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors destroyed it. like i said, for a good laugh, watch it, but i'm warning you, it's pretty pathetic.3/10

while this is horribly dated, i must insist...please, no remake! frankly, it just won't help, as there's nothing which could be added or changed, contemporarily, to make this cinematically better.the novel upon which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. most of king's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. i'm not sure why this is, but when you view this work, if you view it, you are likely to see just what i mean. the book? it's wonderful. it's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just entertaining. the movie? do something else. you can thank me later.it rates a 3.1/10 from...the fiend :.

i must admit, ashamed though i am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. nine years after first viewing stephen king's frightening story however i have now come to my senses, and am able to assess fritz kiersch's work more reasonably.indeed king's tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid. a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the finale into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare.the cast are reasonable, but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible, over the top movie will allow them, and the soundtrack by jonathan elias is spookier than the pictures.a real shame that george goldsmith's screenplay turned stephen king's haunting short story into a shocking horror. isaac, malachai and all the other "children of the corn" aren't really all that scary.sunday, august 7, 1994 - video

nearly everything that stephen king has ever written seems to have been turned into a film or tv series; in fact, i'm surprised that no one has tried to make a mini-series from the guy's grocery list. let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be any less interesting than children of the corn.based on one of king's many short stories, this 1984 horror flick sees linda hamilton and peter horton playing a couple on a long car journey who run into a spot of bother when they chance upon the sleepy nebraska town of gatlin, where all of the adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the corn fields.although director fritz kiersch does manage to build a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after hamilton's silly song and dance, but before we get to meet the freakish isaac, leader of the killer kids), he completely blows it with endless unexciting scenes in which hamilton and horton are hunted down by the town's homicidal half-pints. courtney gains, as violent redhead malachai, manages to appear genuinely menacing, but the rest of the children are not the least bit threatening; as a result, many of the film's 'scary' moments fail to work. towards the end of the film, when we finally get to see the malevolent force that inhabits the field surrounding gatlin, the film descends into a glut of terrible 80s visual effects that probably looked pretty ropey almost 25 years ago, but look positively laughable nowadays.children of the corn might be of interest to king fans keen to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but your average horror-film fan will be most unimpressed.

unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when i read the positive reviews of this film; i cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad.i admit it is not my kind of movie, but i tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.the acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and i'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible. it is the worst film i have seen in many a year, in fact, i wouldn't even call it a film, it's a tragedy. the gay black friend, whom no-one actually calls "gay", it's just implied because he's so crazy? homophobic. this is not good, in fact, this is downright vomit inducing. the jokes die on their pathetic arses, the music is so bad it defies belief. the person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most ear-mutilatingly bad songs they had ever heard and put them in this waste of film stock. oh my good christ i can't believe the 80's produced utter garbage like this, i grew up through them, and i cannot find one thing worth of note here, it must have been a dark time to be a cinema-goer.if you even contemplate watching this film go see a psychiatrist, he will then accordingly slap you, you sick, sick person.

yumiko (wakana sakai), the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; her uncle kazuo (shun sugata), miffed that he wasn't left the business to run, orders a hit on his niece. when jug-eared chef kensuke (takashi okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man invincible (jung yuen), he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill yumiko. instead, he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her. however, she is kidnapped by kazuo's men while kensuke is preoccupied playing an arcade game with cop daniel (sam lee).uncle kazuo keeps yumiko in a hypnotic trance, and takes control of the business, but runs into a spot of bother himself, when his gangster pals threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he allows them total control.meanwhile, kensuke teams up with two martial arts experts, lam kau (yuen baio) and lam doi (candy lo) who are hunting invincible. he learns kung fu and attempts to free yumiko.a mixture of broad slapstick humour, spoofery and fight scenes, no problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved: 80s kung fu superstar yuen baio manages a few fight scenes but is getting a little old for acrobatics these days; director kar lok chin delivers the kind of dumb parody schtick i'd expect from a scary movie film; jung yuen resorts to mocking his character in operation scorpio; and sam lee¬Ö well, sam lee is as annoying as always!on the other hand, collin chou, as gangster ben, impressed me; he has an obviously strong screen presence which has not gone unnoticed by hollywood¬óhe has since starred in two of the matrix movies and is soon to appear in d.o.a., directed by corey yuen. i was also impressed by wakana sakai, but for an entirely different reason: this beauty is easy on the eye and should go much further in the film business.there is some fun to be had from working out what movies are being parodied, but at 104 minutes i found this film a real chore to sit through. if people pulling funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects makes you burst your sides laughing, then no problem 2 might appeal to you. otherwise, i would leave well alone.

dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard. she traps him into bringing her back with him.glynis johns, in the title role, is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out.margaret rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here. in fact, miss rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts.nice to see david tomlinson in the film. he would get together with johns in the far superior "mary poppins," 16 years later.miranda causes mischief in that two guys, a neighbor's fianc√©e and chauffeur (tomlinson) fall for her.ask any mermaid you happen to see, what's the best tuna, chicken of the sea! as for this film, forget it.

seriously... i'm amazed at all the good feedback this show has here. all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do occasional funny things only in like... 2 of the shows, while most of the others sucked... as then they comment on music videos which i cannot stand personally while they either love or like.in most episodes, the only things you will hear are the repitive "let's go score with some chicks", or "i'll kick your ass beavis", or the better yet and usually used quote "that was cool", and above all, their annoying laugh.if you want a good animated show, try the simpsons, ren and stimpy, south park, this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful mtv series truthfully.

according to milan kundera, a porcelain-cat holding a red rose is denying the crap. well, those criminals guilty of making this series probably wanted to show how to make a total opposite of the porcelain-cat holding a red rose. because teenaged sleazoids beavis and butthead are enthusiastically from the place where the sun doesn't shine and their crappiness infects the whole stoopid series. mtv has received a lot of bad-mouthing from it's half-nude stripper beauties, while this is gathering positive reviews in imdb. well, newsflash to everybody - your butt is cool too, if you go out showing it in the middle of the winter - something these two probably would do. still, there is no need to make a film about your butt - and yes, these two probably would do that, too.

i don't care if this show is suppose to be communicating profound messages about human existence.the show is crap....how can anyone derive pleasure from watching it? yet it was received so well. this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out there.i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it. the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry.it is beyond belief that people can watch this show. yet i guess the creators had the last laugh....making themselves wealthy by taking the p.ss out of the very people that would watch a show such as this.i would wager they are laughing all the way to the bank.

i still remember when frog baseball first aired on mtv. in some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that i think every boy growing up in america engages in. i cringe now thinking about how i burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. growing up in the 1980s we all knew "stoners." these were the kids who wore iron maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two. we laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned. so it was easy to understand beavis & co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. to the extent that genxers like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, beavis & co were sort of a strange post-modern anthem for us. strange because like beavis & co we didn't care if we had an anthem. it was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful.

i tried. i really, really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two. it's not that i don't "get it" -- i'm a big fan of asian cinema. the truth is, the movie is infantile in construction, long-winded, and painfully disjointed.i suppose that if you are of alfred hitchcock's school of thought "don't tell them, show them," then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be hard pressed.first of all, the terrorizers tries stream-of-consciousness in the style of jean-luc godard and fails in this. edward yang seems to understand the basics of the technique, but he's very unskilled at it. (perhaps he gets better with age; i don't know as i haven't yet attempted other yang films.) the point is, he uses a dearth of "show, don't tell" that really only serves to interrupt the procession of the story. sure, he gets in some visually arresting images, but they don't draw the story together, and they don't help to make it any better.additionally, the major concept behind stream-of-consciousness and "show, don't tell" is that with the right images, the right drama, repetition, and tight correlation, the viewer will be able to make his or her own inferences; not to say that these will be the correct inferences, but those can be amended as the story progresses, and every director should strive for some of this type of audience interaction. in this, edward yang sorely disappoints. the viewer is constantly on the periphery. there is no reason to be drawn in, no reason to consider the characters or their motives, no reason to get emotionally involved, and really, no reason to stay alert.finally, yang gets lost in the story that he wants to tell, not the story that the movie itself is telling. his art moves in one direction, but like a large dog he can't control, he's constantly yanking the lead, trying to get it back onto the course he wants, not the one that it is naturally following. the most egregious example of this is the ending. the ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband's revelation. the ending of the book that the movie is focusing on, (and by extension, a possible ending for the movie) has already been told to us. if yang had chosen to end at that point, he would have had a much more powerful piece, leaving the watcher in suspense -- does the story play out as the book says, or does yang's "real world" play out differently? asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that yang painfully needs. instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what? for the sheer sake of lingering on a main character -- we didn't' need to know more about her superficially, and yang wouldn't feel the need to tell us if he hadn't made her into a veneer instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with. why else does yang prolong and torture his movie? to get in some more of those "visually arresting images." the movie truly suffers for it. it wants to end, it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unsettled, but instead, yang pushes on. instead, yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer on, causing him or her to constantly ask "so what?" the first ending, the one that yang ignored, that was good. the second ending, well, my thought was"so what, who cares?", because it's not as if it is introducing something that hasn't been put forth in the storyline already... but the last ending? that really was a waste of time. not only did the "real" ending leave me disengaged, but i also felt it was an affront to what the story could have been. yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum-melancholy-noir-tinged conclusion that he had insisted upon all along.my last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself, but rather its post-production. the subbing (if you see it subbed) is horrible. long sentences stay up for a second or two, while short ones stay up far too long. also, as yang quickly changes images, the subtitles are removed from the screen. this is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed, because there's not much dialog going on anyway.

realty television crew are assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and hoody. lots of interviews where the members of the crew(and some of the locals who live in the town of white plains where most of this film is set)talk into the camera about each other, those they encounter in the town of white plains, their current situations, and the showbiz side of their lives. the screenplay is often acidic, cynical, and caustic and killer movie essentially pokes fun at realty television shows, featuring a cast of characters one might find on the real world. if this plot is attractive to you, knock yourself out. i found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat. out of the cast, paul wesley, the director needing a big break, encountering more than he could possibly bargain for, jake tanner, is a nice guy, coming off very likable and tolerant of the crap he must contend with, considering the prima donnas and immature people in his entourage who often cause nothing but migraines. particularly irksome is his producer lee(cyia batten), a tyrant constantly barking orders to everyone, her poisonous attitude creating much tension..she's the type of producer who wishes to capitalize on a small town eruption regarding the killer, using the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy occurring in white plains. those familiar with kaley cuoco know that by now she has perfected the pampered princess, got it down pat because it's the only role we ever see her in most of the time. as blanca, she's polarizing the way she demands attention, milking what little celeb status she has to the hilt, manufacturing much friction as she becomes a source of frustration, and has quite the potty mouth(cuoco may've taken the part just so she could escape her usual television sitcom roles, allowed to spout profanity without restriction) cuoco, along with the entire cast, services killer movie as eye candy, but it's hard to find any character you wouldn't want to see hacked to pieces with a meat cleaver. jason london is the sound/equipment guy, a real creep with a sour attitude, often tormenting the others with his foul comments that are uncalled for. we witness lots of personality clashes, watching how these self-absorbed hollywood types in the cast snipe at each other. the killer's identity shouldn't surprise anyone, it's quite blatantly obvious. some minor gore, but most of the violence is shot off-screen. despite some tame lesbianism, not even this is satisfying. leighton meester pops up in the film as a cute victim. director/writer jeff fisher assembles quite an attractive cast, but i wouldn't be able to distinguish this from the innumerable slashers that have stocked the horror shelves over the last ten or so years since scream. while i've never liked any of cuoco's characters, i never tire of looking at her, but eventually she needs to come up with a role that doesn't consist of her preening, with smug arrogance, always whining and complaining.

first of all, let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like i'd been sold a bill of goods. mind you it's not the movie's fault that imdb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although i don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, i checked it out based on that and i'm so, so sorry i did. where to start? first of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie. it tries once or twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. my reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. also, there's no horror here. not a second of tension can be found. you think i'm exaggerating...i am not. no tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). hell...there's even zero nudity. call me a purist or juvenile...i prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise. and that tired as all hell "reality tv show gone wrong thing"? it's been done before and a lot better. like wrong turn 2 or...ummm....whatever that movie was called with edward furlong. that's how bad this movie is. i don't even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. i also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because "reality tv is taking over". did someone from the past post that with a time machine? are you freaking kidding me? this thing is trash...and not in a fun way.

sebastian cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oil--though none of the locals are aware of the oil. with the help of an evil gunfighter in black, they kill and terrorize everyone. when the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to back down and stands up to these forces of darkness.wow. as i watched terror in a texas town, i felt as if i'd seen this film many times before and would probably see something like it again. that's because aside from a few novelties (such as sterling hayden using a harpoon on the bad guy), it has a plot that is too familiar. once again, we've got a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the farmers in order to gain control of all the land. and, to do so, he's brought in hired guns to force people to sell or kill them. been there, done that in just too many films.i love sterling hayden in films, but just couldn't recommend this as anything other than a poor time passer.

big (and we mean plus sized big) baddie sebastian cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights. when sea faring sterling haden's pop is killed, how will haden put an end to terror in a texas town, armed only with a harpoon? first off, this isn't a b-western. there are no singing cowboys, no daredevil stunts, no interesting action sequences. it's just an independent movie -- you know, the ones that use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general low budget vapidity of the goings on with interesting camera angles.second, this movie, to avoid compromises (one expects) that would cause the elimination of trumbo's important statements about justice in america, and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl, is really low budget. the main problem that causes is that the acting is really, really bad. sterling haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the west. sebastian cabot tries to do a sydney greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. it's not a bad idea, but cabot does not have the acting chops for it. the guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (johnny crale) has the best role in the film. he does nothing with it.third, the script really isn't all that. trumbo gets some digs in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town, and the people, when up against real oppression tend to back down. this is a pretty stale movie message by 1958 -- high noon, bad day at black rock, devil's doorway -- are all westerns that deal with the evils of western society with an eye to the evils of 50s america. trumbo, in '59, certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments, but he isn't doing anything new or interesting with them.so, given all the negatives, why does this movie get a 4? mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie. (the relationship between crale and his girl is, um fascinating.) and trumbo, while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations, is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. just when one is ready to pass out from indy movie boredom, will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack.if you don't like trumbo or westerns, give this one a miss. otherwise, try it. you might like it more than i did.

some of the secondary actors try, really hard. and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. otherwise, this film is horrible.william shatner's character, harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. he's also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? maybe they do.the film's setup is way too long. we don't get to the point of the story until well into the second half. the first half darts and flits among assorted characters."shoot or be shot" is touted as a comedy, but i found it totally not funny. dialogue contains no subtext. none of the characters are believable as real people. they're all stick figures that perform "action" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. indeed, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: silly, inane, birdbrained.i can understand why some actors are in this film. they need the money or the exposure. but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here? maybe shatner wants more comedy roles. is this the best he can do? is hamlin that desperate for money? he used to be a respected actor. what happened?even though the story is supposed to be a satire, it comes across more as a put-down of amateur screenwriters. maybe that wasn't the intent. but that's certainly how the film can be interpreted. as such, the script was very, very poorly written.

uggh! hanna-barbera of the 60s and 70s! what lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! it's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s "hanna-barbera" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful tom and jerry cartoons. however, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. in fact, william hanna and joseph barbera were fired by mgm and replaced by a team of czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons! so, in the late 50s, the team was out of work and decided "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"--and began producing horrid little cartoons themselves--with horrible animation, backgrounds and writing.it's unfortunate, but the team's production of crappy cartoons worked too well---making them rich and the most successful producers of cartoons of the 60s and 70s. during this time, again and again, bad production values was their norm and a long list of very forgettable cartoons were created. in this case, the amazingly bad inch high private eye--a completely unfunny and stupid idea. if you want to know what the show was about, the title says it all.rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us kids!

i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. anyroad, here's a few things i learned about mexico from watching this film.~all mexican women are super hot - remember that little desert town in unearthed? yeah, well, this must be it's mexican sister city. don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. she'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! ~half of mexico is controlled by insane satan-worshiping palo mayombe cultists. ¬°ay, caramba! the other half, as everyone here in the u.s. knows, is run by drug dealers. fortunately, this doesn't much interfere with the sex-tourisim trade and our ultra-low wage factories down there.~mexican cops are useless. don't go to them. go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your vanished friend. she'll be way more help than the cops.~when you're being gruesomely tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists, don't go reciting the psalms or any part of the bible, really. you'll just mess up the mojo.

this movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all "gringos" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. all that is outside one's country's border (and specially us borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else. the "based on true events" is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or, in this case, just to help pushing the film's ideology down some na√Øve throats out there. the perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories: mexicans into disgusting people, mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops, republicans into the right-wing morons, democrats into almost hippie humanists and so forth. is there anything good about the film? i hardly think so, but may be you think differently.

ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for "lady frankenstein", a stagy, costumy italian corpse-walker. joseph cotten("citizen kane")plays the crusty old baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment. sexy sarah bay, who has played in cow-ntless european b-films, usually as rosabla neri, including "hercules against the moon men", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress. cotten makes an ugly, big-headed monster (cud it really be that much effort to make a nice one??), who immediately throttles cotten(who took his royalty check & ran), and wanders around throttling everyone in sight. tania(bay) decides to switch the brain of her lover(who is old and wrinkly) with the brain of a younger man (who is "beautiful", but stooopid), in order to make another monster to throttle the first monster cotten made, who is wandering around throttling people. well, after much exposition, and some throttling, the 2 monsters throttle each other for a bit, tania stabs the first monster in the back, and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - only to have him throttle her! doh! there is so much throttling going on that you almoost overlook the fact that the film is about as exciting as a dead carp, and mooves just as quickly. the alpha video version i saw for this review was heavily edited, and one wonders cow much nekkid people were chopped out, not that it would have improved the film much. director von theurmer previously helmed a variety of grade z euro-trash, including "jungle warriors", "island of the dead"(as mel wells), and "the crucified girls of san ramon". the moocow says avoid this corpse of a film, and find something that mooves at moore of a full...throttle. ;=8)

last night i got to see an early preview screener of prozac nation. because i love everything that christina ricci does i was very excited at first, but as the movie continued i started to wonder where it was going. based on a true story, it is simply about christina ricci's character and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family as you can probably tell from the title. in my opinion this movie moved too fast, and it was way too dramatic. i would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the movie moved through her life extremely fast, and this left no room for us to connect with christina ricci's character. christina ricci's performance was fantastic as always but jessica lange stood out throughout the whole movie, and i believe this movie's success will be all because of her and christina ricci. i would rate this 4 out of 10 and i would suggest you rent this one or read the books by elizabeth wurtzel they are good and definitely worth checking out.

if you're coming to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject. i understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character i've ever seen in a hollywood feature... no small feat. christina ricci as elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end). there is not the slightest hint of what she might be like without depression... not the faintest glimmer of any other aspects of her personality... she just screams. at one point, her roommate tells her, "lizzie, you're such a fun person to be around when you're not being depressed," and my reaction was, "she is?" it seemed odd that the writers would include this comment without giving us any examples, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. it has no discernible structure or flow at all; instead, it consists of a series of awkwardly strung-together scenes of lizzie screaming, then ends. character development? no... scenes of her everyday existence, i.e. going to classes, that might possibly be important details? no... screaming at maximum volume? check. it's not quite enough, i'm afraid. 1/10.

i suppose that to say this is an all-out terrible movie would be unfair, but it's pretty bad. the sub-disney storyline involves dogs playing soccer and falling in love (aw, how cute!) the acting isn't bad, but definitely could be better, especially that of young canadian actor kevin zegers, who, during the whole movie, looks embarrassed, like he doesn't even want to be there. anyway, kids will love it, but parents beware!

at least if you're a disney fanatic (well, of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult, if you love absolutely any film that features animals, especially when they're doing tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, air bud: world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch. i'm a disney fanatic. i enjoyed this film enough, and i'll gladly watch it again.but boy does it have a lot of problems. the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters, too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all. in the space of 82 minutes, we've got adults getting married, teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it, teen competition for love and jealousy, preteens playing spy games, dogs falling in love, dogs playing soccer, dogs having puppies, manipulative parents who'll do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids, housekeeper dilemmas, and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots. i'm probably forgetting something, but that's 10 big plot issues to be dealt with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them, and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that's both not too complicated--this is a kids' film, after all--and that's also humorous and heartwarming. not surprisingly, director bill bannerman, on his first turn being completely in charge (he has a lot of previous second unit experience), wasn't quite up to the task. i'm sure it didn't help that there were at least three screenwriters involved, and probably dictating producers, as well.the end result is that air bud: world pup is extremely choppy. events occur with little justification, and worse, often little explanation. people figure out and do things primarily because they need to--and fast--so that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes. from one cut to the next, time might jump ahead six months or so. we have both adults who seem like maybe they're mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action. some of the threads should have simply been removed, because it's difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as you're introduced to an idea, it's already passed you by.also not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a rip-off of one hundred and one dalmatians (1961), minus a cruella de vil character. and another problem is that given the way the film is edited, i have to assume that the dog, air bud, probably couldn't do much with the soccer ball. unlike the first two films, a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see him, it's in very quick glimpses; every once in a while, these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation.yet, for someone like me, there's a cheesy charm to air bud: world pup. the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous, hokey and kinda clich√©d. i tend to like that combination. it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre. and at times, like the ending, when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the u.s. women's soccer team, air bud: world pup is so blatantly tacky that you can't help but love it.

i'm a big fan of h. p. lovecraft's books, and the mythos background spawned some rather good other stories and stuff like that. and in the last years there came along some boys who did movies about h. p.'s work, ¬ñ for the bigger part low-budged flicks ¬ñ and showed them to the public at places like the h. p. lovecraft film festival. now, like i said, most of them don't have a big budged, but they at least know the heart and "soul" of lovecrafts work and films like "cool air" or "the call of cthulhu" - are what i would think - gifts for the fan base and other loonies that like h.p.'s creation. and then there are people like ivan zuccon, who just rip off the name and create a movie which would have been fun to watch if i had directed it myself and filmed with some friends down at the beach. that is what mr. zuccon did as it seems...but, while blokes like aaron vanek's or bryan moore's earlier movies might not have had more budged, they somehow still had more to offer , like a story, real characters and some connection to lovecraft! just blabbering out names like "nyarlathotep" or "necronomicon" makes a movie not a lovecraft-adaption. anyway, this flick will not only make fans of the mythos shudder and hide, it will also not appeal to people who 1. like good movies, 2. laugh about bad movies, 3. like good c-grade splatter movies or 4. watch everything that has horror written on the dvd-cover. i will not go into the "plott" of this waste of time, as it has already been discussed by others here on this page, but like i said, unknown beyond is like a movie i would have made up with some geeky friends.. aside from that it lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous "moronic-nonsense-but-he-it's-art-stuff". self-made flicks of this "quality" are fun to watch if you know all the blokes in it and ha-ha, see how xy is coughing out the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and stuff ¬ñ but hey, you don't put this in a dvd-casing, declare it an actual movie and want money for it¬Öi give it 2/10 because of the i dunno ¬ñ effort or something like that

i'm sort of between the gushy review and the hate review. i've been a fan of lovecraft (and a lovecraft 'purist') for a long time, and while this little amateur film was of poor quality it had a number of redeeming qualities. i went into viewing expecting the worst thing i've ever seen, and wondering if lovecraft would turn in his grave over it, but i was shocked to find that i actually kind of liked it.i don't want to catalog the movie's faults, so i'll only mention a few that keep this movie from being a 'stellar amateur effort'.it's very low budget and shot on a video cam, so it has the look of some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea then it ceases to be a big deal. the direction is pretty amateur and the shot framing and use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy. still, this film was actually kind of creepy and it stayed more faithful to lovecraftian intent than nearly all the stuart gordan and brian yuzna travesties (my main exception to those films being re-animator and dagon) put together. the idea of being impregnated by some old one is reminiscent of dunwich horror and shadow over innsmouth (which isn't to say this movie is as good as those stories!!), so the overall plot is quite faithful to lovecraft's ideas. one thing that annoyed me was that words out of the bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and afraid. i'm not sure if this was meant to indicate that 'god's' words upset the old ones or just this particular zombie. there was no real answer to that. the rest of the christian symbolism in it reminds me of august derleth's take on the mythos. so in a way this was a derleth style take on the mythos.i would recommend this film only as a curiosity. it shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with nearly zero budget. i liked the setting of the wine cellars. the outdoor shots were sad, though. using the same stretch of beach and trees (and nearly the same damn shot) to convey 3 characters' long journey was really sad. the director needs whack upside the head for that. the acting was standard for an amateur film, with the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for "best impersonation of gollum by an italian actress". actually i think this film was done prior to the lord of the rings movies. maybe andy sedaris watched her and thought "dang, she'd make a great gollum!" one little kudo to the director, though. the makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids. i was upset seeing this and nearly stopped watching. i was like "oh so that's how we know she's evil and possessed", but later on in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on the face of an older woman (both living). so it wasn't an attempt to say 'goth makeup = zombie' but rather, 'goth makeup was left on after zombification'. however, possessed/zombie does equal 'blue contact lenses'...heh.on the whole, i still liked this movie better than the yuzna and gordan films (barring the aforementioned exceptions). yuzna and gordan had much better budgets, but this film did a better job at filming a lovecraft-like story than they did, and on a tiny budget.one quick word to the the make-up artist: i know you wanted 'claws' or something on zariah's fingers, but long, black press-on nails looked really silly.a quick word to the writer of the score: i know you couldn't resist, and apparently neither could the director who okayed it, but when the two characters square off with guns for a 'duel', playing that little whistle from "the good, the bad, and the ugly" killed any mood that scene had accumulated. it was cute, but cute wasn't appropriate.the filmmakers of this movie have read lovecraft and had a great deal of respect for him. i enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character carter with the bad dreams, and the character pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie.

it's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays. usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame. and it's also big shame if people like h.p. lovecraft get abused by the likes of this. i rented this "movie" cuz of the drop "h.p. lovecraft" on it. and i'm a big fan of many of his adaptions, mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver! a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old wine-cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" over the whole movie. no actors, just some stupid low-grade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing, stiff as wood. and so must be the director. it's obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere. but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesn't work. and no gore-effects, just some blood in a river (you drink = you become demon) and dropping here and there. oh yeah, the story: thousands of years ago some "big old" colonised the world and took humans as slaves. then mankind got independent, so the "old ones" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon, that's where it gets to lovecraft. so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine-cellar. unbelievable - the whole thing! but as it is dubbed (german title: "armee des jenseits) and you can find it in most commercial video-stores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that. i find this fact impressive.

as i was watching it, i was getting ready to compose a blasting, lambasting critique of this "film," (it is actually video), but then i saw that someone already did. i pretty much agree with him. but then again, it looks like a lot of effort and millions of lira went into it, so i guess you gotta give them some credit for trying. however, that being said, anyone who doesn't already know the lovecraftian world and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think, ... well, i suppose, that not only is it really bad, but it makes absolutely no sense. thank god i read part of the other review ('twas a little gushy, maybe?) which revealed that this guy also did "the shunned house," (which looked pretty bad, judging by the dvd box), so now i can avoid it and save my mind from any further exposure to such desecration of the brilliance of h.p. lovecraft.

this really is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my whole life (i'm approaching 47)! the description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie. the further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their "acting". i viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering! the location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach. i suppose, that home-video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub-standard. the dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning. as were the actors faces. which brings me to the topic "make-up": by the looks of it they got it as gimmicks in some teen-ager's magazines "my first own make-up" or similar. what made me buy the dvd was the name "lovecraft" printed on the cover. the only connection with this brilliant mind's works was the use of the name "necronomicon", which was wrongly translated as "book of light". the 4,70 euro i paid for this dvd were a complete loss, for the dvd went into the recycling box without any further ado.

maybe we aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here. i have a database of all the dvds i own (including those received as gifts - which this was) and so, when entering a new one, i always refer to imdb for such info as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. when entering this, i noted that it was a comedy and so i decided to watch it at a time when i wanted something light and a good laugh. well, it was neither! there were absolutely no laughs at all and an inordinate amount of gratuitous profanity (are there really radio announcers allowed to broadcast the sort of filth that steve jones dishes out? what if a decent child happened to tune to his station?).rather than enjoy a good laugh (or even a little giggle) i found the whole thing thoroughly depressing. i have given it 3 out of 10 but, to be honest, i don't know what those 3 are for! i suppose the basics of lighting and sound weren't too bad! we have an ostensibly stone-broke loser (giovanni ribisi) who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for the fuel?) and live in what could be a nice apartment (who pays his rent?) given the opportunity of forming what might have been some sort of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl, he even blew that! perhaps it was she (lynn collins) who earned this movie the 3 points! the fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense ("i make as much in one night doing this as i do in two weeks' hairdressing").unless you want to get depressed and bored to the teeth, forget it!

this must rate with the worst films i have ever seen. it just wasn't funny. my wife fell asleep. i suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. if you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an english radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. the strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom. what did happen in the strip club made no sense at all. there was a great deal of mumbling by the lead character with whom i developed no sympathy at all. mena suvari was hardly in the film, presumably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt at producing a film. the bad guys were unconvincing and carried as much menace as a dead sheep.

i realize the line on my summary is not too polite.this film written & directed by scott caan & starring giovanni ribisi,don cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes.there is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.the movie opened in 2 u.s. theatres in late april 2007,for one week & grossed all of $ 914. it quickly went to dvd in early august 2007.we were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the dvd off.this was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill. you saw the main film & figured lets see what this one is like, you might have walked out before we shut it off.the 3 actors & the young ladies in the film all have done & deserve better than this..ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) imdb 4 (out of 10_

let me start by saying i don't recall laughing once during this comedy. from the opening scene, our protagonist solo (giovanni ribisi) shows himself to be a self-absorbed, feeble, and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word, or forming a coherent thought. i guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression. i guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog, but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature. i didn't get the slightest hint at any point that solo ever possessed any redeeming character, which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days. no spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self- absorbed, self-pitying lowlife. i didn't develop any connection with this character. he didn't seem to care, and so neither did i. i actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one point.the dog was not a character in the film. it was simply a prop to be used, neglected, scorned, abused, coveted and disposed of on a whim. so be warned. even though "dog" is in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers.scott caan's role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend/cad. don cheadle is sincere and magnetic - i always want to see more of him on screen. mena suvari was delightfully repellent. lynn collins role of a "stripper with a heart" was well acted, but the character was simultaneously absurd and clich√©d, not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and ribisi.romantic? hardly. comedy? if you say so.

this movie looked fun on the cover and i honestly thought 'how bad can this be?' little did i know. out of the gate the dialogue was unbearable. it was contrived, unrealistic and not even interesting. dialogue on upn syndicated television shows is more natural sounding. the story was implausible and had nearly zero play-off at the end. the end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. the only remotely interesting character is rose mcgowen's, who is mute which prevents her from being ruined with cliche ridden garbage dialogue (well, at least until the end when even she has to speak). the only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is rose mcgowen's nude scene. truly awful. save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a barney video.

a bad quentin tarantino rip off, at least i hope that's what they were going for because at least then i could respect the director for admiring tarantino. one scene a "singing" scene with rose mcgowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. so besides his quinton inspiration and rose mcgowan and her one good scene this film sucked. some of the crappiest dialogue i have ever heard, i'm willing to bet why mcgowan doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been. tries to be funny, never is, tries to be dark and isn't, tries to be stylish and is just bland. who dishes out the money to make movies like this, i'm hoping it was all the directors so no one else's money was wasted. if not for mcgowan the whole cast is awful and when mcgowan is your best hmmm, i gotta wonder.

the two most noteworthy things about "i won't play" are: it won an academy award as the best two-reel short film of 1944; and it was directed by silent-era leading man crane wilbur. the plot of this run-of-the-mill short is inconsequential, the dialogue lacks spark, while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most war-themed hollywood movies of the 1940s (in other words, it's awful). admittedly, there are moments when "i won't play" is funny -- janis paige's totally artificial look and line delivery are precious -- but one laughs at the picture, not with it.

firstly, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. secondly, few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks. thirdly, few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm. fourthly, once a second member of a college small-group project team meets a violent demise, the college president will disband the whole class, and not turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths. since the supernatural elements of cult make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks!

cult starts 20 years ago on the 'quinling mountain range, southern china' as a guy called owen quinlin (robert berson) finds an ancient amulet said to have magical powers, cut to california where quinlin has set up a cult & the members are about to sacrifice themselves when one of them (cazzy golomb) foils his evil scheme... jump forward to the present day as five college students, mindy (rachel miner), cassandra (taryn manning), bailey (glenn dunk), alex (joel michaely) & morgan (victoria venegas) are researching the events of twenty years ago that have become know as the 'quinling massacre' for a school project. unfortunately morgan decides to kill herself which unleashes the evil spirit of owen quinlin for reasons that are rather tenuous, he sets about completing what he started all those years ago by claiming souls so he can finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil use...edited, co-produced & directed by joe knee this is not a good film & that's being kind to it. the script by benjamin oren which seems to take itself very seriously is a dour supernatural tale about a cult leader who comes back from the dead to finish what he started a few years prior, as you would expect the character's involved now have links to what happened all those years ago & it's as dull as it sounds. the character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue just as much so, there's no proper horror or exploitation in it, it's slow going at times, it's predictable, it's clich√©d, it goes completely off the rails at the end & doesn't make much sense when you think about it. the story never grips or engages you, it's never exciting or particularly interesting & i'd struggle to even call it average. there is very little here by which i could recommend cult, don't bother with this one.director knee does alright but the film has that bland shot-on-video made-for-tv look about it, it's utterly forgettable & flat stuff throughout. there's no scares, there's no atmosphere & it lacks any tension. there is no gore either, sure there's a fair amount of blood splatter but no proper actual special make-up effect gore scenes.with a supposed budget of about $950,000 cult looks cheap although it's not as badly made as some low budget horror films i've seen recently. the acting isn't even worth mentioning.cult is a poor film that didn't do anything for me, i'd struggle to call this average. there are much better horror films out there.

while studying the differences between religion and cult in college, mindy (rachel miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates cassandra (taryn manning), bailey (glenn dunk), alex (joel michaely) and morgan (victoria venegas) to research the massacre of worshipers of kwan yin by their leader owen quinlin (robert berson) twenty years ago in california. quinlin had found an ancient amulet in southern china that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls, but one woman resists and he is destroyed. however, after the death of morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that quinlin has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet.the storyline of 'cult" is not totally bad. unfortunately, the screenplay, the direction, the acting, the lines, the camera, the cgi and the edition are awful. i was completely bored and tempted to use the ff button of the dvd, but i resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never-ending crap on a saturday night. my vote is two.title (brazil): "o amuleto secreto" ("the secret charm")

this film is a nightmare! the sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same i got when i finished watching this movie: "uff¬Öok, it ended, what a relief!" i felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! it's a b-series low cost movie, that's for sure, but i think it not an excuse to be so bad! i've watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, nice production, nice acting, and most of all, some substance! this one got nothing of it! the plot is hilarious, it almost seems like an "american guide about how to transform ancient chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie, with some kids playing with the occult"¬Ö i don't know if the chinese tale present in this movie is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! the production is just horrible, a plain zero (what "special effects" are those?). there's no suspense. the supposed "tension scenes" are a complete failure. the acting is not better; and what about the dialogs? oh my god! a movie which has for several times dialogs just like: "i will pass there later, ok? is that alright? ¬ñ ok, alright. - ok? ¬ñ ok, alright, bye then"¬Ö i'm sure it doesn't deserve more than a 1/10 score!too bad to be true!

i can't seem to find anything that is good about this miniseries. why the hell would you ban chocolate when u could ban something far more practical like smoking or alcohol? also the fact that its an australian program and its all set in england and everyone is faking british accents is stupid. overall i think that this show is unrealistic and cheap.

this movie was so bad if anyone out their who starred in the movie are reading this including the director,i hate you! lol,that blonde woman, who was running away screaming through the forest.at least cry rather than scream and keep doing the dodgy heavy breathing!! and oh dear god, if it was the director who sorted out the cameras on this one, then go back to a normal job. no one wants to be watching some scared woman's chin throughout it.damn, don't even think about renting/buying or even having a copy of this within 100 metre radius of your house since it can be harmful to,people who like good movies...when i got home, i thought id rented a pron movie by the acting and style of the camera.

an in-name-only sequel to john carpenter's vampires, this movie takes place in thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires, who enjoy killing people, and a sect of good vampires who do not. while it's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in thailand, the writers don't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale. this film could just as easily have been set in los angeles. which brings me to my next point, which is that this seems a lot like blade lite. we've got the rock soundtrack, the martial art battle scenes, a dance club bloodletting and, of course, lots of sharp objects going through vampires. what we don't have is the budget and talent. yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad his acting wasn't as good, and there's plenty of decent wire work, and tons of revved up fight sequences, maybe too many. the problem is they just don't have the same impact as the ones in any of the blade films. perhaps it's just that the film has a "been there seen that" feel to it.however, for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead, played by the buff and bland colin egglesfield, and his girlfriend. she gets snatched at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. we have no vested interest in her welfare at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot.in the end, you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this, but i can think of a lot better things to do with your time, like renting any of the blade movies.

there's a good story well hidden and never really used! the film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development have been forgotten. what is left is muddled and superficial.turn off your brain and watch¬óyou will probably find that the time goes quickly enough, but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful, you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film.watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.

this movie "vampires: the turning" isn't even really worth the 2 out of 10 i'm giving it. the movie, is very predictable from beginning, up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers. the use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second, though it never did. the acting, was b-rank at best... and the movie was just, dull. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story, had potential though it ended up unable to deliver. oh, and did i mention the wardrobe? the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to "non-existent" because our hero, and his girlfriend (whom he's trying to save throughout the entire movie) wear the same outfits through the entire movie. i'd suggest this film only if your really bored, and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry. ~dave, the horror cowboy

even though this was set up to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay, "vampires: the turning" (vtt) could have aspired beyond that. because it doesn't even aspire to be a good vampire movie, vtt fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting to.using the idea of an 800-year-old thai vampire was interesting, but the story about progeny she mistakenly brought into existence (and now must wipe out) actually reminds me of gizmo and his plight in "gremlins," and that isn't a good thing when it come to a vampire flick.stephanie chao is attractive and serves as the "good" vampire very well, but her lack of any accent grates when you realize that she's an 800-year-old vampire. added to that, when she tells connor he's "a young soul," she doesn't deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an "old" soul. attractive, but not believable.meredith monroe was more believable in her role but, for a "dawson's creek" alum, you would think she would have more screen time. the question of whether amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie, and you never get it. you get a tease of it, but you never actually get any type of development out of the characters for that plot device. it's a cheap way to play your audience, folks.if you want something that is a good vampire movie, go find lugosi's "dracula," and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of flicks from hammer with a lot more strength than this one. in the end, if you want good or sexy, this isn't the place. this is just forgettable.

in thailand, the americans connor (colin egglesfield) and his girlfriend amanda (meredith monroe) quarrel in a muay-thai fight, and amanda leaves connor alone. she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire niran (don hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. connor joins to a clan of "good" vampires leaded by sang (stephanie chao), trying to save amanda from the claws of niran.i expected that "vampires: the turning" were a good movie. the locations and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy music score is excellent; stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive; but unfortunately, the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts. the story is very short, and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race, fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film. my vote is four.title (brazil): "vampiros: a convers√£o" ("vampires: the conversion")

if you're a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you weep inside. granted, i'm only about 1/2 hour into it currently, but it's so painful, i felt it was my duty to warn away real ten commandments fans before they are subjected to this bastardization. i didn't think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in 1950s when the original was shot, but this 2006 remake proves me wrong. i can forgive some lame special effects, but the craptastic dialogue, melodramatic lifetime movie-style schlockiness, and the stilted we-are-wax-figures-come-to-life acting makes me hope they'll rewrite the plot and drown moses in the red sea.

i really wish hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. this movie is awful from the demille version. all the way through this movie i was saying to myself, huh??? - what???? - i don't remember that part. the only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the red sea. and in heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version. did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the red sea was being parted? i think i did. anyway, i might - might - watch the last part tonight.i wish hollywood would tackle different ideas and subject matters when they are making new movies. instead of re-hashing old films.they should of left well enough alone.update:well i watched the last part. did moses make up the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand - or was i seeing things - please someone - email me and let me know. horrible

i realise it's very hard to live up to the first the 10 commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a charleton heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. even the animated the prince of egypt was better.the one thing that threw me off was ramses. compared to yul brynner's version, paul rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-pharoh like. the acting really wasn't that great. for a modern adaptation, i was expecting something better. it just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one. i guess they were running on a tight budget or something. there's an occasional voice-over narrator which i found strange and unnecessary. it also broke up the flow of the story. and um...god's voice/lines were kinda weird.

this movie was dreadful. biblically very inaccurate. moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of egypt, the movie has him about forty. moses was about forty when he fled egypt, was gone for forty years, and was with them wandering for forty years. moses was 120 years old when he died, and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land. i realize movies use a lot of "poetic license" as the biblical account isn't that long, but, if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known, and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character, this movie fails in this aspect, and in many others.even though the 1956 version has its problems as well, theatrically it was much better.

i as a christian am outraged after seeing just the first half of this picture. the film's website says they researched the movie before writing but i believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source the bible. i sat with two different versions of the bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. it was like they made up what was not in the bible and changed what was in the bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth. i personally am too young to remember the 1950's ten commandments but it can't be any worse than this. i have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty.

i appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of moses and the exodus of israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon moses' shoulders. as excited as i was to see this film, i was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (i'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) what is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from biblical texts. one of the overarching principles from the bible is that *god* led his people out of egypt, and he promised that he would take them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey. not only did he give this promise, but he led his people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. he never left them; he always was visible to the israelites. the movie, however, depicts a god who remains silent during the entire wandering through the desert. this movie changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead depicts god as a silent, cruel, disciplinary void.in addition, the depiction of moses was just as wrong. moses was known as a man of faith (why else would he be such a father-figure to israel throughout the old and new testaments, even that moses is known as a man of great faith). however, the movie depicts him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure loner who despises the calling that god placed on his life. ok, i'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the exodus story... but this is beyond creativity -- it is heresy.

with a name like "10 commandments" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible, specifically exodus. not so here. this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmark-made film. remember "noah"?? that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. at least this film had "some" truth to the original story. however, menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of moses, is not in the original story. other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated. so what, you may ask? because this should be representative of the actual story; otherwise, some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened. in today's age, people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible. also, it is a great error. see revelation 22:18-19. the script is already written. why change it? other than the account in exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have the cecil b. demille film to compare it to, which is clearly a far better presentation.the night it first aired, my wife was anxious to see it. i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark-film. she looked puzzled and said, "why? hallmark makes good movies". that might be so, but they butcher the bible. i'm sorry to say that i was correct. not just the story, but the acting as well. with today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie. i'm still waiting...

if you are a christian or a jew hoping to see an accurate biblical (or torah) portrayal of the events in exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. in typical hollywood fashion people who are not even in the bible have been "created" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a shepherd priest who gave moses excellent advise. god is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that moses had to figure things out for himself. nothing could be further from the truth.this movie is a typical humanistic twist on biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on moses for trying to understand what god wants and what he should do. those who know the book of exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie, but outright glaring changes to events. most importantly, they will see a near total absence of god's dialog with moses, which determines everything moses does after the burning bush. far from being alone as portrayed in the movie, moses is guided by god with detailed and direct communication.even hallmark apparently can't acknowledge god's direct role, and without his spoken words to moses many events make no sense. to compensate, hallmark has actually changed some things. for instance, after the golden calf god plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live. hallmark creates a civil war instead and the israelites pick sides, then slaughter each other. moses side wins of course.there may be minimal value in this movie to unbelievers since it may cause them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. the twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn't know their bible. read exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.

this movie deviated from the bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie. i hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the traditionally seen 10 commandments. moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind looking man charelston heston in the 1956 movie. i will not waste my time again watching this movie. they tried so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one at that). i'm pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me, but to each his own. also, it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments, it probably took them 2 months to make this one. the special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.

i had high hopes for this movie i even gave up a night of watching stargate for this movie. i found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing. i might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version, as i have watched that one every year for the last 20 or so years. i doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic, as the other one has. if you have not seen the 19546 version, you might like this one but, i seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one. this has some nifty special effects but that is not what i look for when telling a movie like the ten commandments. i was kind of looking to see how they told the story, and the writers did not do a good job with this one.

i watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology,out do cecil b. demille's classic epic of 1956, starring charleton heston,yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke. of course, i was let down. yes, they had all the biblical characters correct, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, that held your interest throughout the first movie. if you going to have a mini-series, you have to have some "rivoting" scenes, the "burning bush", parting the "red sea",drowning "pharohs armies", "building sethi's pyramids", could have been done with todays' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as "lord of the rings" or the matrix. obviously, they didn't want to leave a lasting impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is much needed in these trouble times.

the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. this was a good rendition of the story. i enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story. but the second half was horrible!!! yes there were violent aspects of this story. but the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things god did for the israelites. towards the end of the movie scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from god. this rendition had some huge problems with deviation from scripture. and big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! their portrayal of moses as this screaming naked lunatic who did all of this against his will is totally false. it showed a moses who had to scream in order to get god to talk to him. wrong the scripture says god spoke to moses all the time and not just after a temper tantrum. they got the people's complaining right, but failed to show that god spoke to moses at sinai in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe.(chapter 19). they also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud which guided them in the day and night.what was the whole joshua thing? the righteous peace loving jew who would not fight until moses threatens him? wrong (he was known as a great warrior) what about the great speech that moses gave the army telling them god had helped them enough and now they were on their own?? wrong (they only won through god's help as shown in their own scenes with moses lifting his staff)and what was that sorry looking ark of the covenant? instead of overlaying it with gold this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold chips to it! oh yeah, it was a "molten calf" not a straw one with little chips tacked on. someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the egyptians. you wouldn't know it from this sorry looking bunch.by the way, the part about them slaying the israelites after the golden calf incident says "men" and does not mention women and children which the movie delighted in showing the viewers. oh yeah - manna wasn't the only thing sent from heaven - don't forget the birds for meat. also, the bible mentions jethro bringing moses his wife and children and then says jethro went back to his own land. it does not say that moses gave up his family.oh well, if you know nothing about the real story, read exodus for yourself. if you know the real story, you will hate this version.

i nearly fell asleep during a screening of this. of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. after a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways.the male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his "one true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love.in the meanwhile, he hooks up with one ugly guy (who i thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher, and some guy who ends up having a "three-second sexual intercourse session" with him in a back alley.it never ceases to amaze me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds, such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm! all of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to which he discards their telephone numbers.there is a brief side-plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. there is also another brief side-plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window. and there is also one more brief side-plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person.none of these things really connect with each other, only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. he seems to be living life like a ghost. there was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world's saddest song on it.otherwise, this movie just seems to go on forever. filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamlike, but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare!i found the ending to be confusing as i wasn't quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven? that would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe. but seeing as this is an "independent film", movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to "use your imagination". for those of you who are seeking out nudity, there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows. in other words, don't waste your time with this one.my rating - 2 out of 10

this early film from director bob clark ("porky's", "black christmas", "a christmas story") didn't really pump my nads like i expected. in fact, it straight up annoyed me. it's about a theater troupe who sail to a burial island, consisting of dead criminals, where they plan to conjure some evil forces and resurrect some corpses... the leader of their group, a conceited black-magic enthusiast and possible homosexual, attempts to summon satan's help with the re-animation of an exhumed body, which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby, deserted caretaker's house and play with it... nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the desecrater's. the make-up effects are okay, the gore is very minimal (pg rating), and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much, which really got on my nerves. i guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some "comedic" status, yet i found no humor in it, whatsoever. the entire concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did. the characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring... don't waste your time with it...

it's always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre. my expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion.children shouldn't play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out. the whole idea of a band of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses had me intrigued. however, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. the actors,who for the most part were competent and amazingly expressive, were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization. some of these characters go from ambivalence about the whole act of defiling a cemetery, to outspoken criticism, back to ambivalence. it's one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film; it's another to produce an overly dynamic, circular attitude that loops every ten minutes.another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead? even with the aforementioned flaws, i would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since i believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency. the scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting (even to a veteran zombie enthusiast) by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound, and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead. current filmmakers should learn from cspwdt about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development.all in all, if you are zombie movie completionist like me, you should take time to locate and view this movie. it's a fun watch.

i'd heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it, but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film's low budget and poor acting - both of which i can deal with when it comes to zombie films. however, what i didn't count on is this film being really, really boring; if there's one thing you can count on from low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment - but unfortunately, this film has neither. i'm quite surprised, because the previous two horror films i've seen from director bob clark - deathdream and black christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining films, but children shouldn't play with dead things just doesn't cut it. the plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life. however, they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood!the plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick, but what i didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the final twenty minutes; and as this is a ninety minute movie, i'm sure you can guess that this isn't a good thing. the opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters. i can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along; but please, if you're going to spend so long on it, you've really got to make it interesting. all of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying, and personally i just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. the film is not without its merits, however, as the atmosphere is a standout. lucio fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well; but bob clark already did it with this film. the direction isn't bad either, but it's brought down by poor make-up effects and a distinct lack of blood, which isn't likely to please fans of zombie movies. overall, i really can't recommend this film; but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you may get a kick out of it.

flockhart's performance is very disappointing. it seems she is trying to make up for her lack of emotion by substituting obscenities. why the r rating includes 'sexuality' is beyond me. there is no nudity or steamy love scenes. the plot is old and tired.

if this film won the lumiere award for best french-language film, then what kind of garbage is coming out of france these days??the subject matter is an important one -- how the african economies are kept as economic hostages by the international organizations that are supposed to be helping them, namely the international monetary fund and the world bank. about 40% of the governmental budgets of several african nations go to payment of western debt, while their people suffer from disease, dehydration and illiteracy.... but the subject matter was treated in the most dry manner that could be conceived by man -- dryer than the sahara that surrounds the country of mali in which this film takes place. more monotone and action-lacking than any documentary i've ever seen (and i'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another comes forward in this "trial" that is "captured" on film that condemns the world bank & imf. some critics may site the colorful visual asides within the film, but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. they belonged better in a coffee table book than in this film.even the characters in the film say something like "this trial is boring" and "when will it be over?" everyone in the theater laughed. were those people on the screen reading our minds??danny glover had a brief appearance in this film. it is a televised movie within "bamako" and it was set within morocco or mali. it was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti-western i've ever tried to avoid. the only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an african woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever. perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the world bank and how it is unintentionally killing africans.and one last technical parting shot, the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselves.i've already summarized the movie for you. don't be fooled by the hype. no need to see this film. you'll never get these two hours back in your life.

endless repetition about the evil world bank, imf, globalization, and the americans are blamed for all of africa's problems¬óand the movie is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. the french actually occupied mali, the country in which the movie takes place, for centuries, but are only peripheral bad guys.one doesn't learn enough about any of the characters to really care what's happening to them¬óthey are completely marginal to the preaching, which goes on and on and on. there's no plot, no character development, no humor (except for a few pokes at bush and wolfowitz, but that's almost cheating it's so easy) and the production values are mediocre¬óno redemption there.it is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a big topic and convey utterly zero real information. the irish ballad "i was dying, and then the famine came" has more content.the movie is boring, the sub-titles are tough to read, there is no real content about the subject of the film, and the propaganda is relentless.skip this one.

abderrahmane sissako may have known what he was doing when he made "bamako," but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been.the nominal "plot" involves a young african singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city. but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as "a mock trial against key financial institutions" dealing "with the overwhelming economic hardships of africa." that's all well and good, i suppose, but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as undramatic and pedantic a way as they are here, they lose both force and impact. put another way, if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the injurious effect of colonialism on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline, the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it now so clearly lacks.the topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important, but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of speechifying as an actual, honest-to-god movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for one's message.

this film has it's heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it isn't much of a film. it is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece put on celluloid. however, your average well-researched op-ed piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here. the filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of african life, in particular the country of mali, due to the unethical practices of the imf, g8, and world bank, by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned. there is an extra 10 minutes dispersed throughout the film that makes a half-hearted attempt at a narrative plot, and a bizarre hollywood western-style shootout scene, where the director seems quite pleased with his own cleverness (hence, the frequent godard comparisons).of course, as the film begins, what and who is on trial is never explained, but as we know by now, the french refuse to spoon-feed their audience.there are many impassioned arguments made, but they are often long-winded, delivered in a shrill monotone (one that becomes quite easy to tune out after awhile), and very light on specifics. the last point is the most frustrating of all since there is a very well-reasoned specific case to be made against the institutions on trial here. unfortunately, all we get in 2 hours is that the imf and g8 are evil oppressors and should forgive 3rd-world debt. we are given no more than the occasional hint to the specific reasons why the organizations on trial are guilty, but never a clear case. the mock-trial arguments and the footage of the surrounding village makes the suffering of these african residents clear, but one wonders why we must sit through 2 hours of it, when a far more precise picture could be painted in a 20-minute newsweek article, or bill moyers episode. in the end, there is something very important to be said on this issue, it simply isn't presented very well, or very clearly, in this pretentious, indulgent piece.

i was looking through tv guide last night and saw a movie starring heather grahm on, who i liked in movies like boogie nights, and austin powers, so i decided to watch it. it started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. i do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and i'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. the acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. definately one of the worst movies i have ever seen, and i like movies like the ones this has been compared to like fight club, but this one doesn't come close!! heather grahm has done much better things since. i gave it a 2 out of 10 but thats because i clicked on the wrong number, i meant to give it a 1.

i got hold of this film on dvd with the title evil never sleeps, it gives front cover billing to carrie ann moss, but she plays such a minor character that i didn't really notice her in the film.i'm afraid that i consider this one of the worst purchases i have ever made. the dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden, i found the acting to be disconnected from the plot. graham's performance to me was of someone who's wondering whether she's left the gas on at home.all in all both my wife and i found this film painful to watch, and it is not a valuable addition to my collection, watch it at your peril, but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time.

honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting (heather graham could never live this down... it has three titles for a reason- to protect the guilty!), beautifully bad dialog ("do you like... ribs?"), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your friday night entertainment! my roommate rented this under the title "terrified" because he liked heather graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits. not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel.horrible movie. there are a few no-name actors that provide some unintentional comedy, but nothing worth viewing. heather graham's dramatic climax also was one of the most pathetic and disturbing things i have ever witnessed. i award this movie no point, and may god have mercy on its soul.

what a crap that movie is. the script is simply non existent. the movie at times seems like a music video. but it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. pathetic way of combining action and rap. one might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. dialogues in this flick just killed me. the scene when harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. generally speaking, recent seagals films are hardly watchable. what the hell happened to the guy? i know he's old but can't he get "hollywood" to drop him a decent script or something? is he running out of dough for his escapades to india that he takes on anything they serve him?

the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.

really? is this necessary? how can somebody make such a film? disgusting!!! seteven seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. not to mention the ending. completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.steven seagal wants to be robin hood!!! well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. they must be kidding. steven segal passes out after a car persecution, and i know he can't act. it was terrible. nothing can save that film.i lost 90 minutes of my life! see you

stephen seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path. however, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice. the story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. poor seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time. in this film, seagal tries to be a good guy but the forces of evil are against him. unfortunately, this is not a great film and rather boring and too long.

ah yet another seagal movie.in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.as bad as submerged?no.but that is not saying much.like perfume on a pig.seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems. then an eastern european territory as usual. there is no wire-fu either here.don fauntleroy does an okay job.however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles.scenes from other movies,a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation.seagal and treech make a so-so team inspiring(unintentional) laughs one minute.sighs the rest.several notable faces turn up to slum it.. sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days.nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check.no more rappers.please? at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever.its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up.he should have gotten out a while ago.

i love watching steven seagal movies not because of the action of the great plot holes but just because it makes me laughoh it makes me laugh so hard this movie totally got no point and is ridiculous compared to this movie pearl harbor rocks!!! and ben affleck need no acting school at all just to give a impression how bad it isfirst off all there so many goofs and bad acting its just getting worse like when steven is try to get out of jail a chopper lands at first the security notice and they led them land when they fly away all of the sudden a guard start shootingor when he killed that guy in the car he and treach both walk away you can't see no oil on the ground behind him steven notice that there is oil without even watching treach trows a lighter and the car blows upand there are plenty of more goofs steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun at him he grabs it and shoot him totally bullshit!!! like some gangster would let that ever happen.the acting is also very worse at the fight scene in the jail outdoor place you can see steven clearly wait to come in action just rewind it a couple of time and you notice the bad actingits just makes me laugh i hope one day it comes to the cinema's here in holland then i'll go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh my self to death

tdy is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection. they take a scene from the order starring jean claude van damme and this angers me because van damme is a personally favourite for b movie comedy. segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself. it also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films. in conclusion of all this if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or woodchipper, then rent today you die.

to start off, i love steven seagal, the man is a genius. but recent movies leave me to wonder, is he trying anymore? his latest movies show almost no effort on seagal's part. in out of reach, its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over. . what seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans, but even more to jean-claude van damme and his fans. in the 2nd scene or so, when he prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. your might be saying to yourself, 'yah, so what does this have to do with van damme?'. well that scene was stolen from a jean-claude van damme movie called the order. rent both, watch both, compare both and you will lose respect for seagal. not only was today you die garbage, but it was, dare i say, an insult. seagal's aikido moves are still good, but why isn't he doing great movies like marked for death or above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, i'm just left wondering 'why seagal, why?'. there are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines on top of that. i hope the up-coming black dawn movie will be another exit wounds or beyond justice, because these last chain of movies he made, especially today you die, really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like double team. please, don't watch this movie unless you hate seagal, if you love his movies don't watch this, it will make you question his future in the action film genre.

i love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...i thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message. at least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off. i was very disappointed. the martial arts is also suffering. i am hoping to see a more devoted segal in his future films. this movie also lacks in keeping the story line going, there are too many gaps so the thought is lost. too many things are cryptic without a solution.

today you die was the 4th seagal movie in a mini marathon i just held. wow, i don't know where to start. he seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes on, and the scenes between seagal and treach where they seem to improv are embarrassing. and what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? i can't recommend this to anyone but the most die hard seagal fan, and even then you are better off with his earlier work. of the 4 films in my marathon (submerged, into the sun, foreigner and today you die) today was the worst. a previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious.

i have just seen today you die. it is bad, almost very bad.1) the direction and editing are awful, just awful. almost made me turn off the movie, fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all. also, i hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. pretty bad.2) the dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful. i like the fact that they wanted to make seagal's character and treach's character seem like they were in a similar relationship to the characters in lethal weapon, but it did not work simply because some of the dialogue did not make sense, and i speak english very well, it's not that i did not understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning whatsoever.3) the script is pretty bad. why do they always try to complicate dtv action movies? seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? is it useful to the movie? no. seagal eliminates a whole bunch of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without having ever met them in the movie. stupid. the story sometimes goes off track and the jumps back without any reason. the story is messy and pointless sometimes. they should have kept it simple and it would have worked.4) in some of the action scenes it is not seagal, it is his stunt double. you can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face. he also beats the guys with movie martial arts, not real ones like the aikido steven knows. the stunt double uses cheesy kicks and punches.5) steven is good in the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said with his real voice. the rest is dubbing but it is not that bad. this was good. also steven seems to be enjoying himself in the movie and is more into the action that he was in submerged. he likes treach as a partner; at least he does not seem to dislike him. also, he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies. i hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes that he wears on the dvd cover he looks more than ok and he should have wore those clothes for most of the movie not the stupid long leather coat.i really think that seagal was willing to make a good movie. the fact that he came late and took off early from the set on two movies directed by fauntleroy does not look like a coincidence to me. i think he realized that the crew were amateurs or only in it for a quick buck and he did not give a damn anymore.in the hands of a better company and crew this might have been a damn good action movie for seagal. something like out for justice or above the law. i honestly believe that. but the people who made the movie are not very good at their jobs or they did not have enough money to do the job properly. too bad since i liked steven in the movie and treach was cool (ice cool ) too, but the rest was bad. hey, at least this gives me hope for black dawn and shadows of the past. i think that mercenary might be just as badly handled. but hey, steven seemed to be back into the same mood he was in while making his better movies and at least that is reason enough to watch the movie.i liked it, but it could have been so much better. 4/10

today you die starts as honourable criminal harlan banks (producer steven seagal) is hired by sinister businessman max stevens (kevin tighe) to drive a security vehicle with $20,000,000 of cash in the back from point 'a' a las vegas casino to point 'b' him, sounds simple right? well what max forgot to tell harlan that the money is stolen & that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery. bummer. things get even worse for harlan when the local cops catch him & chuck him in prison for a long time, however harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught & with a nice $20,000,000 at stake & unaccounted for harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do government agents. harlan teams up with ice kool (!)(anthony 'teach' criss) in prison & they both manage to escape at which point harlan goes looking for some revenge...photographed & directed by don e. fauntleroy one has to say that the shot in eastern europe straight-to-video action films that steven seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better & today you die is a good case in point. this is a terrible film, simple as that really. the script by producer danny lerner, kevin moore & les weldon gives seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around, that of a criminal rather than some government agent/cop/soldier/one man army clich√© he usually plays. in fact if you were being charitable you could say today you die is a rip-off of mel gibson's excellent thriller payback (1998) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect. while payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller today you die isn't & pales into insignificance by comparison. unfortunately here seagal is terrible, he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not. for instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day robin hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor (as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place. the story is full of holes, for instance agent knowles is contacted by the on the run harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone. in that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch harlan? the story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating government agent is actually a bad guy! wow, i didn't see that coming i must say...director fauntleroy slows everything down to a snails pace & today you die feels like it goes on forever, the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value. the infrequent fight scenes aren't great, most are either shot in shadow, very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double. again seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it, it doesn't. there's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of las vegas in this at the start & i thought that today you die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called top of the world (1997) which is about a las vegas casino robbery, as well as using footage from that film today you die also edits scenes from the charlie sheen action film no code of conduct (1998), the jean-claude van damme action film the order (2001) & the wesley snipes prison based action film undisputed (2002) so quite how much of today you die is original footage is anyone's guess.technically the film is alright, considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough. all the footage of the us locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in bulgaria. the rap style music that litter today you die is awful by the way. the acting is poor & seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual.today you die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films, seagal looks old & fat, the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it doesn't come together at the end that well at all. one to avoid unless your a die hard seagal fan, if such an animal even exists...

steven seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing wealther drug dealers, giving to the poor and unfortunate..heh, harlan, the robin hood. anyway, harlan wants to go straight for his girl, jada(mari morrow), so he takes on a job as the driver of an armoured car for a max stevens(kevin tighe, wasted in an underwritten role). max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates, with the intent of using his loader, bruno(robert miano)to bring him the money, but harlan has other plans. escaping the police, hiding the money, and ditching bruno(who had a loaded gun pointed at harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he didn't drive)after evading capture by ramming a huge dump truck, harlan passes out. charged with the murder of police among other things as a result of the damage caused by the high-speed chase, harlan is imprisoned and many wish to know where the money is. harlan joins forces with an inmate, ice(treach), a leader of one of the many gangs in the prison, breaking out with the plans of finding max and eliminating every member of his corrupt entourage. soon dea agent rachel knowles(sarah buxton) becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss, saunders(nick mancuso)who claims there's drugs involved. also injected into the plot is harlan's desire to save a children's hospital about to close and jada has mysterious dreams regarding max.seagal and treach cut up with each other speaking in gangsta, while buxton spends time trying to help harlan, uncovering the possibility her boss is in cahoots with max. mancuso's character is an odd duck, allowing rachel much leeway despite the threat she is to his career. tighe shows up for five or so minutes tops, which is a shame. seagal's harlan escapes prison and finds each and every rich associate of max's, inevitably discovering his whereabouts after cracking a few skulls, snapping some wrists, and breaking some bones. treach speaks in his rapper speech and seagal tries to answer him in kind, providing some unintentional laughs. as you'd expect, a lot of people get shot and seagal doesn't break a sweat. it's interesting seeing seagal in prison, among the convicts, helping treach out when a group of "eses" plan to take him out.

this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 lettered words that can be defined as faeces or excrement. the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous.anywa, onto the review.. there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below.1) steven has lost the plot (i.e. in all his other movies, family / friend gets killed. steven gets angry. steven kills people. the end).2) steven has run out of money (there was a good car chase scene at the start, but i think he blew his budget on that and couldn't afford a decent script writer or editor).3) steven no longer appears to do his own action. instead, the (from memory) 2 fight scenes were shot neck down and from the back, so you couldn't actually see his face. most likely a stunt double. i'm guessing chuck norris.in summary.. worst seagal movie ever. second worst movie i have seen in recent history, and i've seen a lot of bad movies.

ah yet another seagal movie.in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.as bad as submerged?no.but that is not saying much.like perfume on a pig.seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems. then an eastern european territory as usual. there is no wire-fu either here.don fauntleroy does an okay job.however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles.scenes from other movies,a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation.seagal and treech make a so-so team inspiring(unintentional) laughs one minute.sighs the rest.several notable faces turn up to slum it.. sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days.nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check.no more rappers.please?at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever.its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up.he should have gotten out a while ago.

i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film, but with today you die, i feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time.so here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is.there was a time in the mid-80s when a single look from steven seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. if he actually got a hold of you, he would snap you like a twig.these days, although he is still capable of doing considerable damage, he no longer looks the part. he's gone to seed and just doesn't know when to call it quits. he walks like he's dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look constipated, and he has put on weight. his trademark long ponytail has gone, but his hair still looks stupid. how this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond me.today you die is the usual seagal mix of bone crunching fights, car crashes, gun battles and pyrotechnics. seagal mumbles his way through the dull script, delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability. in this third-rate action flick, he plays harlan banks a thief trying to go straight, who is conned into partaking in a $20,000,000 robbery. he gets caught, goes to jail, escapes, and seeks revenge. yawn.there are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which intersperse the boring stuff (of which there is a lot), but reading other comments on imdb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies. seagal is also body-doubled an awful lot in this one.seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his career¬óand that's saying something, considering the lousy 'acting' in some of his recent efforts. most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at ebonics (african american street slang). 'i da man, fo' sho'¬óno, actually steven, you sound like an arse! with a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. and the final moment, where harlan banks saves a children's home from closure is enough to make you blow chunks.damn, i just looked at the clock. i was enjoying trashing this steaming pile of dreck so much, i went way over my five minutes. it's time to post this comment and get to watching something decent.

i ran across this movie on a local tv channel last night. frankly, i have never heard about this movie before. simply, i lost track of seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one. here, again we have a dull seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully. the plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart. i simply don't have any idea why seagal did this movie. man, it is even worst than "out for a kill"! if you watch this movie you will start feeling sorry for seagal. he seems to be running out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.

ho hum. just another flick with steven seagal pretending to be some spiritual being, but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing. he, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., how sweet. lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl. jeesh! this time, he is partnered with ice cool (anthony 'treach' criss). gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty. the dialog is pure crap.they go after bad guys nick mancuso and kevin tighe, two people that were born to play the scumbags.he's squeezing mari morrow and impressing soap star sarah buxton. how cute.i guess if you gotta have some july force excitement, this may suffice. if nothing else it will help you get your degree in seagalology.

great book, poorly done movie. cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the after school special category. no doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong the very talented gretchen mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. feels like everyone just phoned it in. even the makeup (mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude. don't waste your time on this clunker.... go read the book.

this was the first chan film made by monogram. what a come down from fox values and standards! i was shocked when i saw my first monogram after seeing the great fox films. this is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as chan calmly walks across the street. chan is now working for the us secret service rather than the honolulu police department. he is assisted by benson fong, who plays no. 3 son tommy for the first time. he also has a daughter along, iris chan, played by marianne quon. mantan moreland also makes his debut as birmingham brown. he is a cab driver in washington, dc, here, rather than the later chauffeur to chan in the later films.

altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. he doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. the problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.on this "turkish" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me), altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino. (mr. tarantino, if you're reading this, please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life!) he doesn't use subtle moves to do that, all he does is to use extreme stuff, and it gets unbearably absurd and laughable.levent √ºz√ºmc√º as the forensic guy with the cow-licked hair is just hilarious. i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself. because i really found the role insulting for him. demet evgar groping her genitalia was also uncalled for, and did nothing other than making everything look fake. another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% faulty pace setting. when things need to be taken slowly, scenes flow abruptly. and at other times, it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on.if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality, he should use michael sixarrows as his name instead. even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie. he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach, then realize he's not in hollywood, and then take private lessons from zeki demirkubuz or reha erdem on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot. this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those, but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps.by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and otostop, and i still can't divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever.

this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. and of course us americans just have to remake everything successful into english, because man reading subtitles is sooooo hard isn't it! from what i've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant jessica alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) it looks exactly the same but probably w/double the budget. i thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks i have seen in any language in quite a long while. i would recommend watching that one and skipping this one all together, there is no reason to watch this as there is no reason this even called "the eye 2" except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first flick. do yourself a favor watch "the eye" with the volume turned up and get ready for some probable jumping. i watched it w/headphones on and was pleasantly surprised on the excellence that was the direction of the pang brothers. if "the eye" remake does well which i'm hoping it does for the sake of the pang brothers movie careers, but at the same time it seems a shame that people won't/can't see the original, because very often/almost always the remake isn't as good as the original. watch this one if one wants to be mildly kinda of boring flick, but the original is no comparison to this sequel in name only flick.

****probably will contain spoilers****after a successful attempt to get attention (i would not call making sure that you get help before you die a "failed suicide attempt"), joey finds out that she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spirits.overall the movie was a little slow going, but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing. for a horror movie, there were only a few minor creeps and thrills. halfway through, however, was a really good scary scene (i wont give it away though) :) i watched this movie because i really liked the preceding movie, the eye.i was a little confused, however to determine that, other than being a "supernatural suspense" movie from the same creators, the eye 2 had no relation to the eye, *whatsoever*; different cast, different story. the eye2 does not even have anything to do with eyes :\the movie had a few questionable scenes: joey attempts suicide 3 times (4 times, if you count the time when witnesses say they saw joey trying to jump in front of the train), she is associated with brutally defacing an attacker, she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people and yet she is allowed to go about her business freely, without even so much as a psyche evaluation or put in the hospital (for reasons other than her pregnancy).the movie was not the greatest horror movie, the story was rather far-fetched (even for a fiction movie :p ), the spooks were either few and/or nothing we have not seen before. however, it was an "interesting" story and once you know what the "truth" is behind the spooks, it was an interesting twist on the "ghost" story.i rate the movie 3 out of 10.

(the beginning might be a spoiler...)"the eye 2" is the sequel to "the eye". it's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.the sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. "the eye" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas "the eye 2" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. omit watching this. watching "the eye" is good enough.

this movie was a poor movie. the plot was poor and the comedy they "tried" to deliver came out poorly. the accidents seem contrived and predictable. i thought the actors tried to some extent but with this movie, it was so lame it can only go so far.one of the worst films i have seen and don't recommend it to anyone. the only accident to mr. accident was it's release.

i cannot stress how bad this movie is. this director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so "distressed". why are their clothes so dirty? why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head? you should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life buddy giovinazzo.i take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke. why would you ask clark kent to play a crackhead? why are they yelling so much? why is everyone so mean? why are those kids so filthy? no one would want to be so filthy? not even a crackhead child.you need to grow up and not make any movies ever again.

i feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and most importantly--not being lame--, but i guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''a good movie''don't be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for ''once in a life time movies''. keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions,don't spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace & love

most awful casting i've ever seen. clark kent as a crack head, a very feminine looking woman as a trans and on and on.............stupid ass violence just for the sake of being violent. no content, no meaning. this person has never been on the streets. it's a joke!the only thing dumber than this movie is the fact that i finished watching it. i just kept thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did to the very end.trying way to hard to be an off the hook movie. trying to be freaky. so stupid! i really have no more to say but can't leave a comment unless i write more.please take this advice and do not bother watching this movie!!!!! awful!!!

ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clich√©s about tuscany and italy, divorce and midlife. the main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. i'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! the camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow "tuscan" lense filter (perhaps the tuscan sun wasn't tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to rome and (how imaginative!) the amalfi coast. you've never seen the white marble of rome's vittorio emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... i mean tuscan. one of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look.

yes i really found this film distasteful. i didn't like the sandra oh character, she really annoyed me. it is unlikely she would be accepted into rural italian life due to the fact she is non-white. this was a bit of pc nonsense. the film is also offensive to italian men. for instance, the one man she (diane lane) has an affair is turns out to be a caddish cheat. but guess what: at the end your typically plasticky american brick-head turns up, all cheesy white smile and tan, and she finally finds what she wants all along: a real american man, and now she has colonized another part of the world. in fact, this film is quite racist in its depiction of italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants. the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash.

well to do american divorc√©e with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in tuscany. (much more money; whilst having to dicker over the price, she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support.) interminable boredom and the inevitable italian lover ensue; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ing√©nue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of (mostly italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos among them. bloated with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in 'la dolce vita'. (a similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'only you', norman jewison's vastly superior ode to italy and romance). 'tuscan sun' may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of italy. bonus negative point for the extraneous lover parachuted in at the last minute to provide requisite hollywood ending for its targeted audience of oprah-brainwashed housewives. avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you view oprah and dr. phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse.

please do not go see this. i did have several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy.there were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. pacino played pacino again and was aggravating most of the time. the scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor. there is no continuity and i found myself wondering why i didn't leave 15 minutes into this.i would suggest never seeing a movie directed by d.j. caruso. this really was awful.

this is by far probably the worst film al pacino could have starred in. the movie had no real plot. it kind of careens into 24 different directions. it seems that the target audience for this film are people from gambler's anonymous.mat mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be pacino's prot√©g√©'. so he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service. does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills? it was just plain stupid to think of. the trailer did promise to show us how he makes his sure-shot picks but after going through the whole film i have yet to see what skill if any he ever had. if you want skill try looking at robert de niro's character in casino now that is showmanship. at some point in the film, mat's character picks his winning bets at a flip of a coin. anybody could do that. al pacino seems to talk a lot and i mean blabber mouth in your face dialog. i think that style started with scent of a woman and worked for him because he finally won an oscar but now i think its just irritating. he seems to be always sermonizing. he does do a mean act of portraying a man having unstable angina (that's an impending heart attack) its typically reminiscent of his acting in godather part 3 which he plays the aging,diabetic mafia don corleone but other than that pacino's talent is wasted on this film. rene russo is just plain eye candy for this film. she's kept in shape and shows it off in the tight clothes she wears throughout. this film is plain crap. do not waste your money on it. it is much worse than the gambling picks of mats character in the film.

pacino, and maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. i swear, i am an avid movie goer and fan. i have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another. until now. the story-crap the acting- crap(rene ruso-major league was good) the plot-crap the subplot-garbage the teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junki have vowed to watch romy and michelle's high school reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag of a movie off after 10 minutes. i was out of town for a seminar, and this pile of mung cost me $9.99, and 2 hours. i have been cheated. this director should be in jail for fraud.get with me if you have other review questions. i am always right.

just finished watching 2ftm. the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend, something i never do. needless to say i was very disappointed. the story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey. first off i am not a mm hater, i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star. i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times. yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but i think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill. showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. i think one time would have been sufficient. it wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......enough about that, let's get into his role. i feel his acting was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable. i know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and cheesy. it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines a few times! in short, i didn't like his character even though i was supposed to. the accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. his character was just too much of a tool, as brandon or jonathan. pacino and assante were great, but that' no surprise. piven is fun to watch as arie....oooops i mean jerry. i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. it's insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. cool story that appeals to the male man 2. hunky hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3. al pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school 4. throw in armand assante to seal the deal 5. plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessarythis will be good enough for most people, but not me! anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. would this movie be much better if: a. directed by sodeberg b. decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mmi will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing russo. the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola.

another entry in the pacino-as-mentor sub-genre. you know the drill: young hotshot with hubristic flaw (in this case, matthew mcconaughey, trying to jump-start a flagging career by latching onto pacino's coattails -- hey, it worked for keanu and colin, didn't it?) is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure (pacino, natch). young hotshot learns from father figure all the ins-and-outs of a lucrative yet degrading career (this time, it's football handicapping). father figure plies young hotshot with money and hookers and power, but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair . . . that is, until the young hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the father figure and all, or almost all, that he stands for. (clearly, stone's *wall street* pretty much set the ground rules for the pacino-as-mentor sub-genre.)we are also meant to take these latter-day pacino films as a parallel to reality. again, you know the drill: living-legend actor demonstrates his unquestioned superiority as compared to an inferior young actor. the latter may bear and grin through the process, but he must recognize that he isn't going to get any of the good lines, much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement. now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the pacino-as-mentor canon: *scent of a woman* and *donnie brasco*. in the former case, it was a one-man show, anyway; in the latter case, pacino had met his match as a scene-stealer in the person of johnny depp. however, those two movies were serious-minded, not merely an exercise in showboating for showboating's sake. pacino has made damn certain that his younger co-stars in the films since *brasco* are nowhere near as charismatic as depp. by the way, none of this speaks very well about the living-legend actor. like his contemporary de niro, pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. *two for the money* is the worst example yet, worse even than *devil's advocate*, which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked connie nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie. well, this is what happens when you're crowned king too damn early -- just ask marlon brando. frankly, i've seen one too many al pacino films with the same plot -- and the same overacting from the star -- to be charitable any longer. did i say "none of this speaks well"? actually, it's humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying audience. no one's going to accuse matthew mcconaughey of being a shakespearean actor, but even he doesn't deserve the role of second-fiddle to this intolerable old show-off, with the added implication that he, mcconaughey, will never measure up to the greatness that is al.i've not wasted space on the plot particulars. if you want a synopsis, imdb provides a no-nonsense summary, though i think i laid out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph. basically, you've seen this movie before. many times. the particular milieu in *two for the money* is the seedy world (underworld, really) of sports handicapping. pacino runs an office of "bet advisers" -- that is, middlemen between you and your bookie -- and even has a cable tv handicapping show, co-hosted with several of his top guys. one thing the movie got right was the sleaziness of these type of shows . . . but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words "gamble" and "gambling". if you've ever seen proline or other shows of similar ilk, you'll never, never hear jim feist and his cohorts say the word "gamble". they ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their picks . . . but if you were from, say, mars, you'd have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks. "gamble" is the f-word on sports-handicapping tv shows -- strictly verboten.gambling is against the law, you know.1 star out of 10.

i will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that i thought it stunk. the great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. no telling what you will come out of the film with. for me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. there was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to pacino. the meeting and the airport. other than that, well, what a waste of time. utterly. pacino is just doing the same thing over and over and over, he would have been better served by taking the performance down about five notches at about the level of his prot√©g√©. everybody always says, but this movie could have been so much better. sure they all could have been. but really most of them just should never have been made. including this one.

al pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. in other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. mcconaughey must have been impressed by pacino because he became a promoter of the "f" word also. this might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. i don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this. "it shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for all those that have to listen." maybe it is time that al takes some acting courses again to sharpen his talent. oh yes, the movie... probably the worse thing that mcconaughey has played in. hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. rene russo as always was hot.

for all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in l.a. for any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. the saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. that's what remained with me as a total mystery. i can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living. what i fail to comprehend is an artist of al pacino's talent prostituting and embarrassing himself with this level of mindless junk. hopefully he'll choose projects of better value in the future...and for value, save your time and hard earned money. skip this!! let's send hollywood and al a message.

this movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end i wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.normally i don't write reviews, but i was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. the only reason i watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer. we were not disappointed in the least. its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line:brandon: i just want to get to know you.girl: you just want to get into my pants.brandon: i want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. i don't see you wearing any pants in this equation.overall, i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously.

very poor script and acting. i was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. all is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and the "talented immature pupil". the characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. artistically it is as empty and insignificant. the colours are very impersonal and light. only the poster may be appealing. al pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. but i can't have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending. everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time...

i went into this movie determined to like it. i usually enjoy dramas like wall street, glen gary glen ross, boiler room, etc...i went into this movie thinking i would be on the edge of my seat. plus, i am a big pacino fan.what a piece of garbage. quite possibly the worst movie i have seen in five years. this makes pacino's debacle in any given sunday actually look good. first, half the movie is watching matthew mcconaughey lift weights. ok, we get it. you are in shape matt. we don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron, shirtless.secondly, how many plot holes are in this movie? why introduce the phone call from brandon's long lost dad and never address it again? what was the point of his mom hanging up on him - why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money - what was the point of that? the guy from puerto rico who lost 30 million? also, since sports betting is illegal in ny, and its acknowledged its illegal, how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet at the end? this was simply a very poorly written script. it had potential, but it was devoid of a coherent plot. i thought pacino learned his lesson about script selection after any given sunday, but apparently not. my gosh, this is the same actor that starred in the godfather! don't waste your money.

i am usually a big fan of pacino (scarface, serpico, devils advocate) but since scent of a woman he pretty much plays the same role and shouts a lot. this movie had no endearing characters to warm to. brandon played by bongo mcconnahey is the least likable of the bunch. he nowhere even approached a real human being. pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness how old is renee russo? the only high light of this wretched mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has like 10 lines total. even the usually reliable jeremy piven was utterly unlikeable.note to writers of movies, they do not usually work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit likable (noteable exception scarface). as the movie closes and old brandon is at the airport my only thought was, please let a plane crash into the airport and kill brandon.

i didn't have much high hopes for this one. before seeing it, the story yelled "stereotype" at me.i mean... come on! it's so stupid the plot line about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created him are immoral, then decides to change everything.i had to see it three times. the first two times i fell asleep because i was so incredibly bored by it. it's very rare that movies bore me so much i fall asleep during them. the third time i forced myself to watch it, simply to be able to warn people about it.i got the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the cool/neat things from other scifi/action movies, and put them together to make a kick-ass movie! they took the android/robot, lots of action, thin story, stereotype characters, and a big fight in the end and threw it together. unfortunately, the movie sucks. the acting is so wooden you could build a house out of it, the storyline/plot is absolutely laughable, the camerawork and editing is horrid, the direction is non-existent, and to top it all off, everything is so cliche and ridiculous that it just annoys the hell out of you.i was left with the feeling that i could've spent the time watching this one doing something much more creative, like trimming my fingernails, or watching the grass grow.

you know i only watched 15 minutes of this film, so i can't really describe how great it is. i mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go. then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director. you just can't miss. i mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. this film comes on. you watch it and are shocked. it is so brilliant, so original it is so great. it will feel to you that half an hour later you've turned off the screen, but as you go to your bed you see it's only 15 minutes after midnight. enjoy!!!3 out of 10

mario van peebles tries to go the jean-claude van damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes awol to preserve himself, however the government isn't going to take this lying down, so among the simplistic plot van peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film. this blatant rip off of universal soldier (which is far more fun then this) simply goes nowhere. the main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert. van peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify a viewing. on the other hand the movie does sort of resemble a competent version of r.o.t.o.r although where as that abysmal bad movie was hilarious, this one only yields occasional laughter in its laughably unconvincing action sequences. also like r.o.t.o.r it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the movie is awesomely boring. plus the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the movie needs an actual action scenario to work, because the material is too dull. in all regards solo is a very weak film.*1/2 out of 4-(poor)

solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored. the acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is adrien brody's performance as solo's creator bill) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it whilst you where watching the film. that said, such films are more about the action than the plot/acting and, as such, live or die by the action set pieces - that after all is the point of such films - to give 14 year-olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance. and even on this solo fails to deliver - what little action there is is poorly done, dull and uninspired. after seeing the trailer for this on television i was hoping for something along the lines of predator with a robot replacing the predaot. instead i got a fairly lifeless action film with a poorly constructed attempt at depth by taking on message that robots can feel too. watch terminator ii or predator instead.. both classics that this film desperately wants to be except it lacks the inspiration or, to be fair, the budget.

when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash. guess which category solo falls into. apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, weapon, solo stars mario van peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination. he hides out in a mexican village, obviously to save money on locations and extras. paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, i suspect. william sadler is along for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy van peebles. van peebles manages to beat them all with ease, of course, while corbin watches all this with bemusement from afar. the movie is a horrible ripoff of the the terminator and cyborg series, and apparently has little to do with its source material. it is horribly written and acted, and the big fight at the end if downright comical. van peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh. he looks like he is doing the robot dance most of the time.

i had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on tv. it's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made. not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible, the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheese.i would highly recommend this film as an example of how not to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours.i turned off the tv during the last ten hideous minutes of the show. calling it "pathetic" is a gross understatement.

solo starts as a team of us soldiers go into soth america to blow up a rebel airstrip, joining them is a robot named solo (mario van peebles) who can use any weapon ever made, is fifteen times stronger & ten times faster than any human being. something goes wrong though & solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which colonel frank madden (william sadler) isn't happy about, back at base & general haynes (barry corbin) orders solo to be shut down & reprogrammed. one of solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the south american jungles where colonel madden & his men are sent in to recapture it...this mexican american co-production was directed by norberto barba & one has to say solo is awful. the script by david corley was based on the novel 'weapon' by robert mason & is one clich√© after another, robots were popular at the time solo was made in hollywood & at the box-office so solo rip-offs the likes of robocop (1987), universal soldier (1992) & the two terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as predator (1987). this is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like terminator 2: judgment day (1991) to me. the character's are poor & colonel madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating solo at all & why he would kill other us soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it. you know i saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god i didn't spend any money on it) & i looked it up in the tv guide & do you know what it said? my tv guide described solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring mario van peebels' which when i think about it is a perfect description of solo. in less than ten words my tv guide has hit the nail on the head, i mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars mario van peebles & it's definitely dire. enough said really.director barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact solo is a robot. so the military lose solo & colonel madden is sent in to recapture it right? i'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside solo in case something like that happened? surely at the very least solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? i'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong? the violence is mild, there are a few ok fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really.technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in mexico. the makers of the dolph lundgren action flick agent red (2000) edited footage from solo into that film. the acting is poor, van peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... william sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic die hard 2: die harder (1990).solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget hollywood sci-fi action films like robocop, universal soldier & the terminator films. not recommend & i'm going to start & pay more attention to my tv guide when it comes to choosing films to watch...

the novel weapon which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage is one of the best techno-thrillers to come down the pike in a long time.the character of solo, who is not supposed to look like a human, is a wonderful creation and it was simply awful to see him reduced to just another terminator-clone with mario van peebles horrendously trying to "act" like a robot. there is nothing worthwhile about this film.why does hollywood insist on snapping up the rights to excellent novels and then butchering them? there are so many things wrong with solo that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man with no legs to a brisk game of hopscotch. avoid this awful film and seek out the 2 novels by robert mason that feature the awesome character of solo. the books are weapon and an excellent sequel solo.but don't pay any attention to this awful dreck of a film.

solo is an action movie about a terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. when a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of central america, where he takes refuge in a village. the military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.mario van peebles does a decent performance the android. his movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. and it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. the acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but i was not expecting anything too good. the special effects were decent as well.solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. it lacks the substance that most movies possess. but if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

i was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week he told me it was so bad that i had to see it! so i went on an auction site and bought the film. this is probably the worst film i have ever seen. it makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. terrible acting and terrible storyline. plus he looks nothing like michael jackson?!i still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. van peebles is a joke in this film.robots cant bluff... psyche!i have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... psyche! dvds were probably even out when this film came out but if i had my way it would be a straight to vhs release yes people it is that bad!

this film is a load of crap. it's quite disturbing to see that anyone is able to say that this is one of the best films of the year. what can i say? bad acting, bad action scenes which becomes really comical in the end. pardon me if this was a comedy, then i didn't understand it. if it was i regret laughing of the tent scenes! do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of watching this! good night!

wow! after the first five minutes of watching this "film", i was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. it's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. i honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. the film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. i normally don't have a problem with sov movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. and where did they find these "actresses"? i have seen some bad acting, but this takes the cake. watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what i mean. bci entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this god awful sludge. this has to be the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing. i want my 74 minutes back! if you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes, without either shooting your tv or committing mass homicide, then give a shot. after all, what have you got to lose?

i like bad films, but this thing is a steaming heap. from the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating acting, don't waste a second on this pile. fifth graders could have made a better film and first graders could have written a better script. want a real synopsis? ugly chicks in neon bikinis dancing for way too long. a disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting. the on-location sets weren't even passable. the church scenes take place in a dance studio, and oh yeah - what's with the two tap-dance numbers that come up out of the blue?oh, and the total number of naked breasts, which couldn't have even saved this film - 0. add this one to the trash heap.

ok - say some college in southern california has an movie making class. and some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. and then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. and failed.that is my only explanation for this, this, thing. good god they left the date and time counter on during some of it. the picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot. well apparently there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the 3 hour introduction sequence was finished. but i am glad they did because i never would have gotten it by watching this.stay away from this.

....is where i'm assuming this movie came from. i mean, i've watched plenty of b movies over the course of my young life so far, and i wouldn't even classify this as a b movie. i remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.so the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. women in bikinis, who aren't even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight. i mean, i can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie. according to most people on this site, manos the hands of fate and pod people are the worst movies (mst3k classics :-d)...i used to be one of them. then i saw this movie. usually i don't try to trash a movie too much, but the people who made this really do deserve it. it is that bad and that unbearable, and i'm assuming the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who rated this a ten.

move over manos. back off boogens. it doesn't take a baby genius to know that malibu beach vampires (mbv for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to zarkorr the invader) the worst film ever. the only horror in this thing is watching it. i wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. if this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. it's dreck. no wait. i dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. ulli lommel (of boogey man fame) would call it "uber dreck" or schei√üe. it should be used to torture prisoners. if you find it on a shelf in a video store, back away from it quietly and notify the authorities.

if a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. i am a huge fan of "b" movies, and i have seen my share of bad ones, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke. this movie even surpasses the "so bad it's good" phase and goes straight on to the "so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it" phase.it is hard to say what is more disturbing: .1. the fact that the people who wrote this thought their political satire (i use the term very, very, very loosely) was witty enough to film .2. they were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money .3. that someone actually thought it would be a good idea to pick this crap up for distribution on a horror anthology dvd.were i a weaker man, i most likely would have jammed grapefruit spoons into my eyes and then blindly flung myself to my death in oncoming traffic after watching this. as it stands though, i live ,but i am forever scarred by the experience.

wow -- this movie was really bad! you talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. the transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. the plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. even then... the amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. are all of those images necessary? my last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie. would the pd really send a lone officer into an unlit warehouse, subway tunnel, or wherever to find a body, when the location of the perp is unknown? and why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden? it's like the writer was trying to fit in every hollywood cliche he could. don't waste your time seeing this piece of... something.

a formulaic story with all the tired cliches. i was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! what a waste! how many original scripts are scattered around without being produced?  at the climax i could predict what will happen in every single shot. oh, and don't even get me started about the idiotic sexual tension between the gorgeous female cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger. yeah right. i can buy that. what next? fingers porn?

i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. i won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.the movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washington's finger lovingly. it may be the only thing he could move, but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washington's finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me. i laughed out loud and shook my head.the direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se7en, but here it is executed far more simplistically, and far too obviously. to call it a poor-mans se7en would be an understatement, this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washington's best efforts can't convince that this is a box office film.

am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces. a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. by the time he returns (still no senior cops, socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie - this is new york isn't it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she'd stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene.i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! the horror continues:- not in the film itself (pretty ordinary i'm afraid) but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington. this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners, entrusts the work to an untrained cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible. now that was a bright idea eh? i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable.i have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie's lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended!

the bone collector is set in new york city & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts lincoln rhyme (denzel washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. jump forward four years & alan (gary swanson) & his wife lindsay rubin (olivia birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after new york cop amelia donaghy (angelina jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of alan. amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of lindsay. having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for rhyme & the police...directed by phillip noyce i watched the bone collector last night & i have to say it's one of the worst big budget post the silence of the lambs (1991) & se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers i have seen, in fact it makes friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! the script by jeremy iacone was based on the book by jeffery deaver & is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin. for a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. the character's are truly awful & i didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. first we have lincoln rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. he is seemingly impressed with amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, i'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? why is he so impressed with her? then there's capatin cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain? then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target rhyme anything else. also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! how did that happen? i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. it's never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? i mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of new york to choose from? there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going. there is so much wrong with the bone collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.with a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 the bone collector is well made with good production values & that hollywood gloss about it. i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen, i think she is absolutely terrible in this. denzel washington just sort of lies there really, queen latifah is awful & even michael rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clich√©d & one dimensional character.the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while, i saw it for free on telly last night & i still feel cheated & ripped-off. there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? works either way to be honest...

i saw "mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.it is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction, poor plot line and 2-dimensional characterisation.i did, however, know this when i went in. i was willing to trust the two gentleman that i went with (knowledgable comic buffs) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were. unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict. though, this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction. the pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly dwells on the pretty pictures.i would not have gone at all without that reassurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing. i have tried with neil gaiman's work but am always left with the "emperor's new clothes" feeling. i live in hope but last night was no exception.i do not think i can continue with an analysis of gaiman's work without losing the will to live. read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described. i cannot comprehend, however, how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl, nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility, or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother. these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination. all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.

i didn't really hate mirrormask. i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. the movie begins with a young girl named helana who works in a circus. but while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away from the circus. during a heated argument with her mother, helana wishes she would drop dead. bad move. the mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. on the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she "finds herself". personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming. the early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block. but a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to cgi land where nearly everything is a computer image. the problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have. while films like the wizard of oz seemed enticing to explore mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image. there's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty (the librarian is a masterpiece) they just disappear so quickly that they're soon forgotten. helana and her sidekick valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. overall mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash. stick to the real world kids.

so many people loved this movie, yet there are a few of us imdb reviewers who found mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arse-clenchingly boring. i fall into the latter of these two camps, and i will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly.firstly, to set the record straight - i like neil gaiman's books. i sometimes find his knowing, sarcastic, 'wry asides' humour a little geeky, and i actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone - but, even with his occasional lapses into crap 'dad' gags, i find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special.interestingly, one of gaiman's strongest works is coraline, a gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness. his latest novel (anansi boys) overdoes the funnies, and tends to read at times like terry pratchett does the sisters of mercy (not the nuns but the band). mirrormask inhabits similar territory to coraline, and when i saw the stunning visuals in the trailer, i got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen.in praise of the film, some sequences do look stunning. however, the visual effects are occasionally ruined by cgi animation that looks like a media studies student project. backgrounds and scenery are often incredible, but some of the character animation looks clumsy, amateur and cheap. in an early dream sequence, the spider is animated beautifully, but the book-eating cat-beast looks poorly rendered and very 'computer generated'. compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as 'the corpse bride', mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed. however, in mirrormask's defence, the budget was tiny for such a grand vision, and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven.what cannot be forgiven is the stilted, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. the actors struggle desperately with the dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it. conversation is rendered completely unnatural, the jokes fall flat time and time again, and the turgid speeches appear to be the writer's only method of plot exposition. combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of 'phantom menace') - this renders the film almost unwatchable. in such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed, and in the main they fail terribly. the girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stage-school dialogue, and occasionally shows real promise, but it is never enough. the god-awful cod-'oirish' of the valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time) puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material. it appears to be valentine's job to explain the plot to younger viewers, and to add a bit of light relief. personally, i wouldn't want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter.what else is wrong with this film? answer....rob brydon. what's annoying (for us brits, anyway) is we know rob brydon can act! we've seen him hold the screen for half-an-hour on his own (doing those 'marion & geoff' monologues), and in the first 'real world' bit of the film he is fine. however, stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am-dram-ham i've seen in years. a real shame.what else is wrong? answer... the wanky slap-bassing, sub-courtney pine saxing and unlistenable, too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never shuts up. god, the music is incessant, loud, distracting, irrelevant and, if that isn't enough, has wanky slap bass wanking all over it. it makes the dialogue very hard to hear, but that could be a blessing in disguise.what else is wrong with it? answer.... the whistling mime artist. in modern society there should be no place for mime, apart from certain secret places in france. every moment the camera lingers on the gurning, whistling, moss-juggling, yogurt-weaving idiot, i understand why the edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and fractious when festival time comes round again.my final criticism is that the film is pretty dull. surrealism often is dull ¬ñ it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike, zen, accepting state, or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises. a story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked, whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping.finally, apologies to all those who found depth, meaning and wonder in this film. you have managed to suspend your disbelief, you have seen past the creaky cgi, ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted, and understood the maker's grand, imaginative vision. i wanted to, but i couldn't see past the real-world failings that dragged it down.i hope neil gaiman gets it right next time, if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.

there are no saving graces in this dreadful, stagey, boring snooze-fest, which brings to mind "the ransom of red chief"! even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. glenn ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. donna reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. leslie nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. the son is such a repulsive little brat, i found myself rooting for the kidnappers. the only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler. perhaps i'm being too harsh on the actors, after all, all they did were to read the lines given them in the script. ah, the script, that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to tug on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach.

by 1971 it was becoming more and more obvious that hammer film studios were on the way out . hands of the ripper is a case in point where even the idea smacks of desperation - the spirit of jack the ripper posses his own daughter ! yeah okay no one was expecting a documentary but this plot seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for stupid premise and you do find yourself questioning why on earth the producers brought jack the ripper into the story . was this to give the movie a snappy title ? the production values are unimpressive and the cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap tvm feel but you know you're not going to be watching a classic hammer horror as soon as the title starts because the music is laughably inappropriate . i think the composer was trying to make the theme tune haunting and touching but the music resembles something out of a soppy romantic movie . i will give the cast some credit as they do take their roles seriously in what's a far from serious movie i didn't enjoy this film much and it instantly reminded me of the phantom raspberry blower of london town from the two ronnies which i'd been laughing at in the weeks before i saw this

i've watched this film a few times and i never really liked it. i'm not a fan so termed "nu horror", so i can't be dismissed on that account. i found it a little sleazy, i think the thing that irks me about hammers is the sexploitation aspect, not sex mind you, but sexploitation. i'm surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly, so i'll have another look at it. but for me, it wasn't creepy, it had no atmosphere, just a bit of "omigod, look at those bad/stupid london prostitute women and that little innocent anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man, ooherh!" i suppose ultimately for me, the film had no depth whatsoever, just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value. this no doubt was to some degree what victorian england was like, but the sets are even too clunky and dull impart a sense of victorian menace. roger corman's horrors on the other hand, now that's style, atmosphere and elegant horror. for me, this was just exploitative, flat footed trash.

strained and humorless (especially in light of its rather dubious psychology), but well-paced and comfortably lurid, this genteel body count movie highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of angharad rees as a young woman periodically possessed by jack the ripper, thus allowing for some nasty gore effects amidst the edwardian propriety. it's all pretty standard stuff for hammer, but is handled with a good deal of visual elan, even if the central relationship, between psychoanalyst porter and rees, drives the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained.

hands of the ripper aspect ratio: 1.85:1sound format: monoan edwardian doctor (eric porter) uses newfangled freudian analysis on a young girl (angharad rees) who turns out to be the daughter of jack the ripper, and just as deadly...unlikely hammer horror, in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young waif without attracting so much as a whiff of scandal, even when she takes to murdering all and sundry with a variety of lethal implements (broken mirrors, hat-pins, etc.)! l.w. davidson's screenplay wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the material's inherent subtext (porter's obvious attraction to rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued throughout. some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for hammer, and these were clipped from the original us release (despite an r rating from the mpaa), though the complete version is now available on home video. porter and rees give excellent performances, and the climax in st. paul's cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unaffecting. directed by peter sasdy.

the lavish production values that you generally find in a merchant/ivory film are all here, but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair. i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own ancestor, sally hemmings, has barely a role to play in the proceedings. there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters. nancy marchand sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun. and both gwyneth paltrow and greta scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes. in fact, gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. her role as thomas jefferson's daughter, martha, is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is. one moment she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she's deploring the whole system of slavery. nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for jefferson or any of his exploits. very disappointing all in all.

a day in the life of a dimwitted cab driver sometime around christmas: the cab driver picks up a fare...they have a 'really insightful' interlude...he drops off the fare...he picks up another fare...another interlude...and so it goes on like this for 90 friggin' minutes...none of it convincing (or interesting) for even one minute...skip it!

if you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers, then this is an excellent movie to watch, for informational purposes only. i can just hear it now, "wait, just wait a second! why don't we follow a cab driver through his entire day! cabbies are funny, and so are the people they meet, and they only talk to each other for just a couple of minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! harry, you take care of production, joan, you've got materials, brian, you go round up some actors and we'll all meet back here tomorrow to start filming!"the first 90% of the movie could not have been any worse had that very thing happened. at least with no planning whatsoever, there is always the element of surprise to be found. some of jim carrey's movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box offices. the problem here is that the first 90% is pretty well scripted out, and it pretty much sucks. paul dillon plays the cab driver in chicago who is working all day. we pretty much see what he sees. people get in and out of his car and he drives all around town. he talks to those people for a few seconds and then we get some more people. i'll admit, there were a couple of funny bits here and there. a religious family tries to talk the cab driver into going to church with them, he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital, breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home. i guess the moral of the movie is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a larger sphere of influence over the lives of his passengers than you might originally think. for some people, he's just a means of getting from here to there, but for others, his very ordinary words help change the direction of their lives.the last passenger of the day is used to try make sense of the rest of the movie, and to a small extent it succeeds. it had a bit of that deathbed repentance feel to it where the good majority of the movie sucks and then at the very end, it tries to make it all better in just one or two changes. i wasn't too impressed with the movie as a whole, but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again. as far as the actors go, paul dillon is it. john cusack, gillian anderson and julianne moore are all in this, for about 30 seconds each, but don't watch this for any of them or you will most certainly be disappointed. i will give the other people invovled some credit that it's not your ordinary movie they have produced here, but it wasn't a very good one either. there just wasn't enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half. it was a decent effort, but it failed none the same.

i don't know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago, but if you're expecting the events described on the box, forget it... that would have been a good movie. the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter dispair that i took viewing this movie. if you've seen hbo's taxi cab confessions, this is the same thing, only fictional, and not even remotely as interesting. if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver, check out the 20 minute short they run on encore from time to time... it is actually worth watching. i have never, ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this ... thing. boring, boring, boring. it does offer one unique trait, which is this: it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill in the gaps. which would be great, if you actually cared about any of these people. instead i found myself yelling at the screen, weeping like a child, praying for either the end of the movie or my own death. the cab driver himself (though well played, considering) runs through emotions seemingly at random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic. sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for it's own sake. "dammit, i learned all these emotions in acting class, and i'm gonna use them!" now that i've been thinking about it again, i do hate this movie as much as i did!

the girl in lovers' lane: 3 out of 10: homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon. plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as top gun and spartacus. the girl in lover‚Äôs lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope. in fact, it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k, whom rarely notes such things in their riffing, simply cannot avoid it.the film is about two drifters. one a rich kid (lowell brown) running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts, the other is a professional hobo (brett halsey). the hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner, a pool hall and a whorehouse. our drifter scholar gets a second look from the diner‚Äôs waitress (joyce meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane) who clearly is past the age of being choosy and whose only other prospect is creepy jack elam doing a steve buscemi impression.on the surface, this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment. while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing, the acting is actually pretty good with both brett halsey and jack elam giving solid performances. the story is slight, but hardly the robot vs. aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot, but relatively competent.it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious. halsey‚Äôs over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious, his inability to commit to the waitress (or at the least get past first base) are telling, and the dozens of glances between him and the kid; a hand on shoulder, the sleeping arrangements, blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other. you don‚Äôt have to be freud to figure out this undercurrent.

i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on "mystery science theater" have received a tons of low ratings on imdb. however, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the "mst" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. now i am not saying that "the girl in lover's lane" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current imdb score of 2.1.the film begins with bix and danny meeting. bix is a veteran drifter and danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country. once they blow into a small town, bix needs to rescue danny again and again because danny is quite naive--a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato.along the way, something happens to the self-assured bix--he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him. and, in an odd subplot, jack elam plays a super-creepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone--yet oddly, the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him. ultimately, however, when elam puts the moves on a girl who bix is falling for, things come to a full boil.overall, while not at all a great film, there were many interesting plot elements in this film--enough to merit a score higher than 2.1. the biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of danny one time too often. considering the minuscule budget, however, it's a watchable little film.

okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an mst3k flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *spoiler alert* the film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named danny meets a bum named bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where bix meets a pretty girl named carrie (who is so very.) now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough. all they needed to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie... carrie loves bix... bix loves carrie... a creepy guy in town lusts for carrie... now, i know what you're thinking... bix fights the creep and ultimately decides to settle down with carrie, and danny returns home, and they all live happily ever after... right? wrong!! because carrie gets murdered by the town creep, because bix is too gay to commit. (there are so many homosexual undertones between danny and bix.) and then, the whole town decides to lynch bix, even though the town creep would've easily been the prime suspect. then, the town creep confesses to killing carrie without much hesitation... (must've felt bad, the poor dope.) then, danny brings bix home with him... that's the film's "happily ever after." sad, huh? all i can say is, thank god for joel and the bots. because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite mst3k episodes.

the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low-budget film. on its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix (brett halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny (lowell brown) and the girl, carrie (joyce meadows), that bix meets who would like to look out for him. nothing overly interesting happens (bix goes out with carrie, bix gets danny out of trouble, carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered. her father blames bix, pulls him out of a jail cell, and just about beats him to death. now their roles are reversed and danny has to save bix.until i read the reviews on imdb, i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into bix and danny's relationship than was really there, but i see now that i'm not alone. it was quite obvious to me early on that bix and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959. the homosexual nature of their relationship, while never openly expressed, is still quite obvious. their living and sleeping arrangements, bix's reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute, bix's inability to commit to carrie, and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents he's "brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye. i'm sure they exist, but i can't think of any movies i've seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one.as for the movie, i don't know any other way to put this ¬ñ it's boring. as i wrote earlier, nothing much at all happens for 90% of the run time. the characters are dull and the actors aren't good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark. the lone exception is jack elam. his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching. elam had creepy down pat! but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic. carrie is killed and bix is immediately blamed? what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life? anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night? her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner, yet he never considers that the leering jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death? not a lot of logic there. and what about jesse's confession? danny grabs jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse? real tough guy, huh? why would he confess so easily? and after he confesses, no one thinks to grab him? it's awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off. in any other reality, he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder. the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something i'm not willing to do. overall, i'm giving the girl in lovers lane a 4/10.

a young man, named danny, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named bix, who agrees to tag along with danny and watch out for him... and his money. they end up in a small town where they meet carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. bix starts seeing carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? he's no good! understand?). meanwhile, the town creep, jesse (played by a perfectly casted jack elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering carrie. danny keeps inadvertently picking up whores left and right (because he's loaded with money ¬ñ he has almost a hundred dollars!) whom bix has to constantly chase away (there are a lot of ambiguously gay overtones between danny and bix in this flick). eventually, bix and danny decide to leave town but trouble is a-brewing, due to jesse the creep.my review of the movie itself: a terrible, dated "troubled youth" flick from the '50s.my review of the mst3k version of the movie: i've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of mst3k ever. the riffing is dead-on, all the time. except for the somewhat downbeat ending, this movie is easy material for joel and the bots, especially danny's constant screw-ups that bix has to rescue him from. the host segments are pretty good too, especially the segment with the `train song.' hopefully, rhino releases this episode to home video one day.

this one is one of those classic b movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. it's done really cheesily and big stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. but jack elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid jesse (now jerome!). my favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves ("you loved her?"). danny, big stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. there's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. joyce meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. and those yellow ruffles (rawr!). oh, and booze is evil according to mr. stupid.this movie's a hoot. watch the mst cover of this and crow's terrific elam homage!

here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end. did the director decide to become auteur suddenly, 80% through the making of this movie? yeesh. spoiler alert thing start out typically enough for 50's youth-gone-wild; there are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the kindly old diner manager, and the town creep. things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only likable character is killed off and the anti-hero is blamed (this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie... but all this stuff starts happening and unravelling during the final reel! major curve ball). then things get weird; the kindly old codger forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody pulp. the mere presence of the hero's friend somehow drags a confession out of the real killer - the leering, creepy town nut (which in any real universe, he'd have been the prime suspect to begin with, even if the anti-hero was found with her body).we're left with a somewhat feeble "happy" ending, which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes preceding it.even more odd is this film's insistence on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt, but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight. maybe this was on purpose - perhaps bix's resistance to settling down with the girl was more because of his sexuality (which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed, and thus not discussed or even admitted by him) than his need to be a "drifter". if the director's intent was to spin this as a sexual yarn - that the drifter drifts because he feels he's an outcast sexually; that his paternal regard towards danny is not, in fact, paternal but spousal; that his inability to remain with carrie is rooted in a sexual revulsion that even he does not quite understand - it could have been made more clear. instead, we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoeroticism and behavior that is completely heterosexual.these young men sleep next to each other even when they can get some room to spread out. when danny is propositioned (and once even in bed with a woman), bix flips out and takes him away. danny pays bix's way (sure, there is another explanation for it, but it still strikes a chord every time you see danny buy bix's lunch). they end up living together at the end. not since hitchcock's "rope" has homosexuality been so blatant but denied.mst3k did the right thing by taking this one on. aside from jack elam, there is little to commend the film.

it is a shame that a movie with such a good cinematography as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of sarah cawley (cinematography) and adam lichtenstein (film editing), and above all, no sense of what goes on in mexico city. the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city, but it is unable to do it. it is a shame, a lot of film wasted. an american woman tries to find her brother who has been kidnaped. the first account of the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems that there was no effort to come with a better narrative of the ordeal, especially when it comes to the issue of the attitudes of the us embassy personnel in mexico city, when dealing with an issue like this one. compare, as an example, with frantic(1988), which deals with a similar issue. something similar can be said of the role of local authorities. compare, as an example, with todo el poder (1999). the movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the looks of the city itself, paying little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many twists that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief. who is going to believe that a mexican patrol from mexico city is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the mexico-us border? and that this policeman is going to be able to use its radio from the border to mexico city! only the producers of this movie. it is worth mentioning that unlike frida and other movies about mexico at least in these one mexicans talk spanish.

"nicodemus" is almost a copy of "red" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in clark kent's unpredictable life. when a poisonous flower finds it's way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is lana. the episode was good up to that point, for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark. at the last moment, he refuses her but the damage has already been done. this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn't suitable for people under the age of twenty, due to it's adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect the flower has on pete) was good, but the middle that was all about lana's alternate personality, was most defiantly not, and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode. i give this episode two.

whether or not this adaptation of the marvel comic was made ¬ñ and shelved ¬ñ so its production company could retain the copyright to the characters, it doesn't change the fact that it's utter rubbish. the dr. doom and (especially) thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent. director oley sassone can't even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind woman's pov, the dialogue is absolutely dismal, the team's costumes don't fit properly, and the effects are appalling: the human torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens, while mr. fantastic's powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end. joseph culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about, jay underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible, and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release, it's equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good.

admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. they weren't low enough. scholckmaster roger corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to oley sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy tv series such as 'hercules' and 'viper'. with a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film. there it should have remained. however, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, this "fantastic four" sits out in the ether waiting to cause a pratfall for those rare people unlucky and foolish enough to step on it. if you have ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. the people who made this were very true to the source material, and that is the only thing for which they deserve any credit in this fiasco. this presents the origins of the heroic group that develop superhuman powers when the shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. reed richards (alex hyde-white) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes 'mr. fantastic'. his girlfriend, sue storm (rebecca staab) can become invisible, and her brother, johnny (jay underwood) can spontaneously cause fire to erupt from his body. finally, ben grimm ('credited' to both michael bailey-smith and carl ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin mutates to a rock-like hyde and is then referred to as the thing. there is a prologue that sets up a former classmate of reed's, victor von doom (joseph culp) to become their enemy, dr. doom, who orchestrates the sabotage of the fantastic four's space flight as an act of revenge for injuries he blames on reed. there is the set-up, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climactic fight. there are more details to the poorly-written script, but they are negligible.this is a movie that was made simply because the creators (i use that in the technical sense of the word. there isn't a whole lot of creative imagination at work here.) had the legal rights to do so. the plot will be undoubtedly mirrored in the anticipated big-budget release set to be directed by tim story in 2005, but tackling a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic insanity. what special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'the great train robbery'. when half of the climactic fight reverts to full-on hand animation, you're almost relieved to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned to be in this project. there is very little consistency of style in this mess as well. most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors, and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci-fi pieces. there is camera-work, but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience. editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). editing spins are even used to supplement the poor special effects when the thing transforms. the one scene where morphing technology was put to use was shocking only because it was such a positive jump up in quality.limited camera work is not unforgivable. in 'clerks', only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. it worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. kevin smith never let his reach exceed his grasp. 'the blair witch project' caused some audiences to suffer motion sickness from the jerky hand-held stuff that put that pseudo-documentary together. when all was said and done, it was an effective work about the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation. there is no sense of story or theme here on either a spoken or visual level. with this 'fantastic four', you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the film makers and performers seem to be actually trying to rival other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry. any film involves a great deal of time and work. it just so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this. if you're one of the people who were involved with this, it was most likely done as a stepping stone on the road of a (hopefully improved) film career. everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity. for those who are curious about watching this movie, my advice is to only do so with a group of friends (so you can all point and say "you watched it, too") who have been forewarned about the experience (so nobody gets hurt from the shock), and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to ease the pain between the accidental laughs.1 out of 10
