i think that most people would agree with me if i were to say that the movie alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere. i've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have ever exceeded alien's eerie tunnels and darkened halls. the cave is a film that tries very hard to reset the bar. i believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as alien yet not once throughout the movie did i ever feel even the slightest bit scared, or thrilled for that matter.so now that we got the ball of negativity rolling i might as well explain why the cave's main hook (the atmosphere in case you weren't paying attention) fizzled into a waste of my time. i'll say right now that most of the sets were gorgeous and nicely lit but what we hear and what we know is there tend to ruin what we see. the music for one is terrible. we either get corny rock music or over exaggerated haunted house music. okay maybe that's pushing it a bit but i couldn't bear it. the many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell) i didn't need rock music blaring in my ears while they were simply swimming through a cave. this actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then amplified by the following watercraft crash scene.anyway as i already mentioned, it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere, heck no. the creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to invoke horror. i'm supposed to be worried that they are going to appear and merely a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood turn cold. the cave does wisely take a page from the alien handbook by not showing the entire creature for very long and leading up to the reveal with only glimpses but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so lame. i guess it would be rude to spoil the specifics but they are basically the aliens with wings.i guess you get the point by now. atmosphere ruined. yet i know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting. i'd like to say that about the cave but i'd be lying. this movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day. we've seen all this done better before with the exception of a few neat scenes (the guy impaled on stalactites, the eel and the rapids) so you really don't get any thrills from watching people running from uninspired alien knockoffs in endless tunnels.ah but no the pain doesn't end there. we must also take the characters and acting into account. well i can't remember a single line of dialogue other than "run!" and the only character's name i can remember is jack but that's only because it's placed in almost every other line near the end of the movie. perhaps the actors were capable but the script didn't allow them to do anything other then run and argue. they had almost no background and whenever somebody died they simply shrugged it off. it's pretty sad when you consider that the cgi eel puts on the best performance in the film.speaking of cgi; there's plenty of it, most of which is terrible. i do commend them on using suits (at least i think they were suits) but nothing truly meshes with the environment and as a result most of the effects end up looking pretty hokey.so i guess to wrap it up, the cave is bad and has very little going for it. had the film been a scifi channel premiere movie or low budget direct to video release i might have a bit more love for it but this film was a theatrical release. with more wit and talent this might have been a frighteningly fun movie but as it stands this film is about as scary as going into the basement and that's not very good.my review from frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave

mixed group of "experts" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some big, razor-fanged, winged, computer generated creatures lurking about. the cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit. and that's all she wrote with this low-aiming effort that even fails to combine action, science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels. imagine if someone gave the folks at the sci-fi channel 30 million dollars to make a monster movie. that's precisely what the cave is like; almost startling in its ineptitude at times, full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to entertain. the only difference is they had more money to build sets, more money to polish up the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give awful performances anyway. otherwise, it's business as usual. some of these movies are still fun to watch. this one is not and there are loads of reasons why: 1.) it takes itself far too seriously and has no sense of humor whatsoever. so you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesn't even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is. 2.) the opening sequence serves no purpose whatsoever other than killing a few minutes and adding to the redundancy.3.) unoriginal looking cgi creatures are not impressing anyone in this day and age. 4.) utilizing shakycam and quick-cut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy, unimaginative film-making. and why further obscure the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions, such as fire and explosion of bubbles? it makes these scenes not only difficult to see, but also impossible to enjoy even on a no-brainer action level.5.) even though it wants you take to it seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is awful and there's no attempt whatsoever at characterization. casting 25-year-old-looking model types in roles as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran explorers might provide some eye candy but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays out completely straight. sorry, you can't have it both ways.6.) there were two exceptions to the model rule, as they did decide to cast an old guy and an average looking joe. these were the first two characters killed off. 7.) for a little diversity, they also squeezed in a black guy and a chinese guy. strangely, neither are given much of a voice in this film and basically stand in the background as whitey discusses what their next move will be. insulting. 8.) furthermore, how many movies have to be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the very end just to ensure hot white female lead and hot white male lead end up together at the end? ugh. give me a break already.9.) much of the acting was horrible. cole hauser's performance was completely laughable. the other male lead looked like he just walked off the set of a soap opera and coasted by using the patented dimpled-smile-makes-all-the-ladies-swoon technique, which is the pg-13 gender-switch equivalent to my-large-breasts-make-all-the-guys-swoon technique often used by ladies in r-rated films. either way, his performance was completely phoned in. daniel dae kim (from the tv series "lost") and piper perabo also stunk up the room with their stilted and monotone line delivery.10.) was the ending a joke? absolutely terrible. please god, we do not need a sequel to this garbage.so basically i wouldn't bother with this one, unless you've never seen a monster movie before or if you're just really desperate and the only other thing on is "the simple life." the sets were good, the blue-tinted photography is ok and a few of the actors (lena headey, marcel iures...) tried their best, so i decided to boost the rating up one notch to a "2."

i rented this film from blockbust because of the cover and title! sounded intriguing!! this movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. the "monsters" needed more face time. we needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more "oh sh--" moments. the photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re-breather blows up. there were too many close ups. but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. overall, i would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers. but this movie is definitely a below average rent.there are definitely better picks. i would recommend anacondas 1 or 2 over this pick.

i just don't get these reviews! i can't help thinking they are written by the sort of l.o.g fan who would worship anything they ever do without questioning whether it is actually any good.i'm a massive fan of the programme but thought this film was a pointless project. i could forgive the ridiculous plot if i had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice. at one point, i thought it might just me before i realised hardly any laughs were minting from the rest of audience.i wasn't expecting much of a plot (very few tv comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes) but thought the odd bit of classic l.o.g dialogue or visual joke (like at the start of each programme) would carry a film. after 5 minutes of the 17th century plot, i was begging for it to end (little did i know it would carry on for the rest of the film). it just wasn't funny.i was just massively disappointed and can't see history being too kind to it, even if a few die-hard fans write enthusiastic reviews.

please re-watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out 25min tv episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life, truly an awful film. tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins, micky has 1 line, and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns, also mr briss's accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras, and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god-awful piece of crap..........batman and robin all is forgiven

very disappointing and incoherent - every now and then a germ of an idea would develop and be discarded in the next line - it had the feel of a film that had been cut and re-cut to try and make it work - i was bored and distracted all the way through, and i'm speaking as a huge fan of the series. many of the jokes were unoriginal and tired, the medieval section went on far too long and the quality of acting was very poor - some on the tiny guest spots, like simon peg and liam cunningham did more in their alloted 30 secs than the main cast did in 90 min's.it's a shame, really.the only really interesting thing was getting a look inside the little shed on soho square - which is something everyone who is ever in that part of london wonders about.

this review took longer to write than i took to watch this film. it's just plain bad. the plot is terrible in comparison to the tv shows. it is flat, unfunny and boring.it is clear that the log ran out of ideas long before this film was green lit. viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop.bad editing, bad music, bad acting. zero dynamism, zilch chemistry.a film that doesn't know what it is, made without any love to some mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling kind of angry that so much money was wasted.the log obviously were made an offer they couldn't refuse, or perhaps their egos have simply got the better of them. it's a bleak marketing push that perhaps would have been better when the log were fresher and more inspired.i however, did know when to stop, and did.please! someone try to convince me of this film's finer points!

as a massive fan of the three tv series, i was very interested to learn that log were moving onto the big screen. in my more honest moments though, i had my doubts about the likely success of the concept, and whether the writers would be able to sustain the high level of wit, comedy and horror that infuse the original series.unfortunately my fears were not unfounded, and the film was a huge disappointment. i struggle to understand the other comments on this site. obviously people are entitled to their opinions, but the guys i watched it with, all agree with me, and they are just as big fans as i am.the acting lacked conviction, but they are so good that even when not at their best, they are still highly watchable. the main problem was the plot - and the script. there were a few laughs, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after walking out of the cinema. so rarely have i felt so utterly uninspired by a film and so unmotivated to discuss it with others.i write this comment as a warning to other league fans - get a wide range of opinion on this film before going to see it. if you love league, you might be able to convince yourself that they didn't totally mess up their move to cinema. if you can't convince yourself of this, then you will have tarnished in your mind the otherwise spotless genius that exemplifies the tv series.log at the cinema? more like log. (or little brown fish).

if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed. i went to the cinema with a group of die-hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn't as funny or dark as the three series before. in my personal opinion it was a money spinner. the writing was contrived and the plot confused - no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do. it was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms. i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series. i will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia.

it became apparent in the first 25 mins of watching this that the writers really wanted to make a feature length film and they probably certainly enjoyed the whole process, but then seemed to forget the fact that it needed a decent plot! if the best they could do was have 3 of the dullest characters enter the real world and have 'all sorts of amusing capers' then they should have left well alone! i didn't laugh once, and that whole "adventures of baron munchausen/time bandits" thing going on in the middle was very, very poor! convaluted, contrived and very loose. it just seemed like a whistle stop tour of anything they thought 'might' work just to drag it out to a feature.full of holes eg - the royston vasey characters needed the writers to carry on writing in order to save them, yet jeff managed to write himself into the sub-story/time-filling william and mary and era. if he could do this then why didn't they just carry on writing royston themselves - duh?? and herr lipp's audition? what was that for? i mean what was the point? he did it, and we heard nothing else whatsoever about it? my main point is, that while i loved the series, this was an ill thought out, seemingly rushed project. put it this way, the plot was so poor that if we didn't already know the characters (and as a fan i had a certain loyalty to carry on watching), and we relied solely on the the story itself, this would have fallen flat on its face! at best it would have gone straight to video, and at worst would never have been made in the first place! or maybe that should be the other way round?? truly dreadful....

am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else .. this film was terrible. i'm a fan of all 3 series of the league of gentelmen and have always respected the originality of the writers, even when the format changed in series 3. this film however was a blatant half effort, the plot was extremely poor having the characters going into the real world made this film see more like the last action hero. there was about 5 moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would end. this would have been better as a 10 minute short on the dvd .. it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do, and looked like some of the writers disagreed on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first 30 minutes.if your a true fan of the league of gentlemens ability to stay fresh then you'll hate this film. if you only watch it cause there was nothing better on tv then u'll love it.someone back me up !!

don't get me wrong, i love the tv series of league of gentlemen. it was funny, twisted and completely inspired. i was looking forward to the movie, the premise was interesting and i looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take them.it was a total disappointment, for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters (why not pick mickey & pauline, papa lazaro or tubs and edward for the main parts!?). it was unfunny throughout, half baked gags and poor slapstick humour.the real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama / comedy (and i will use the word comedy loosely). it distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward, not to mention painfully unfunny. the direction of the movie is appalling, and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take. very rushed.then - the three headed plasticine-esquire monster. what the hell was all that about? plain ridiculous, it felt like the league of gentlemen tagged it on at the end.all in all i found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film. what was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film. if i could give it 0 out of 10 i would. do not waste your money seeing this.

i am a massive fan of the log. i thought the first two series provided some of the best comedy this country has ever seen and the third series, though different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. the thought of seeing tubbs, edward and briss on the big screen made july 3 something to wait for. yet, somewhere, it all went horribly wrong. the writers had no story and no real ideas. the part set in old england showed the glimmers of genius that we know the league are capable of but these scenes did not fit well with the film. geoff provided the best of too few, largely poor jokes and lipp and briss's performances were big let-downs. if you love the league, save yourself the time and money and watch episodes from the tv series again. and again. a massive disappointment.

i watched this film in the theater in edinbourgh along with 3 other americans and our friend from manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time. we would have much rather spent an extra hour to watch vapid dialog of star wars iii that was playing down the hall than all of this. opening with one of the worst jokes i've ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen, it did not take off with a bang. throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard, the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand, then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldn't even smile; i cite the giraffe cum-ming as a prime example. the plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind, which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen. i think a lot more could have been done with that angle (the two different worlds, the fish-out-of-water experience of the characters, the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and distinguish the characters and writers from each other.) but too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much 'bizarre' and 'goof' as is humanly possible. and to say the 16th century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute afterthought; but no, its a full length torture film of unfunniness. as we were leaving the theater, which had very little laughing inside it, i overheard the young hip electro-clash british couple behind me saying "that was rather good wasn't it. you never really knew what was coming next." and the girl responding "yeah, quite surprising." and that was it. if this is what is meant to get out of british people from watching a comedy: no laughing for 90 minutes but a teeny bit of communication between two lovers at the end, then this film succeeded. but i have more belief in british life than that.i've not not-laughed so hard at a comedy film since american pie ii.

had the league been unknowns pitching this script, the backers would simply have turned around and said "no - you're not having the money - this is dreadful". as a fan of the league of gentlemen, this is their poorest outing to date. not particularly funny, not particularly entertaining, there are few laugh out loud moments. they do exist, but they are few and far between. i felt the format was tired and really dragging. the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows. as for being a film. i felt the xmas special had better production value; the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they didn't film in the original royston vasey (they filmed this on the cheap in ireland). the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible. also, the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv equivalents. tubs and edward, much underused (again), just didn't sound like themselves. disappointing really, because i was hoping for something far more entertaining. this really was the league's equivalent of the 1970s comedies where the cast go to spain...

this film was okay, but like most tv series it would of been better if it just made for television. the best and most loved characters only had five minute roles, whilst the three mediocre characters were all the way through the film.unlike most british movies that are based on television series, this film does kick off and it seems to be on to a winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians.the film then doesn't go anywhere when hillary in a room with the captured steve, lipp masquerading as steve, and geoff somehow writing himself in to the medieval times. which made me think 'hang on? how come he doesn't need a key to enter in to that world unlike the royston vasey characters? the medieval scene was okay but monty python did it a lot better and of course funnier, with cameos from peter kay and simon pegg, both didn't say anything funny, kay had a line and pegg just sat up on wall looking bored.what also grated me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes such as hillary escaped to the caribbean in the television in series 2, but in the film he's escaped from prison, and also lipp is a paedophile vampire which wasn't mentioned at all in the movie, which was also quite disturbing when he's left alone looking after the children.there were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations such as how did geoff and the dark one escape from the medieval times back in to royston vasey? like series 3 it started of good but as the film progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending.they would of been better off doing what monty python did and remade all their best and classic sketches from series 1-3 and the christmas special, and turned that in to a film which would of re-introduced the characters to a whole new audience, who can't be asked to watch the series or to tight to buy the dvds.best advice is save your money and wait till it's on television..... where it belongs.

according to the blurb on the back of the dvd case; jonothan ross 'laughed until a little bit of wee came out'. i suspect that that has more to do with his being full of it.i never watched the series for one reason or another, so maybe i'm missing some essential cues. as to this movie; i watched the first 45 minutes or so. i laughed once, smiled once, then reached for the newspaper whilst waiting for something else entertaining to happen. nothing did.evidently intended to be a surreal spoof upon life in the post-python, gross-humour style, this one falls absolutely flat. there's been a host of comedy series on television in the last few years, not the least of which were 'bottom', 'the fast show' 'the vicar of dibley' and 'father ted', each one engaging a group of bizarre but hilarious characters and sketches. any one of these could knock this crap into a cocked hat.if the series was anything like this movie; i'm surprised they got the funding. happily it was one of those £2 tesco bran-tub purchases and is now in the local charity shop.the moral of the story is; don't believe the pundits, never pay top dollar.

jean-hugh anglade is excellent as the teenaged boy who wants to be a whore to please the man he loves, but the rest of this film is so bad--acting, writing, cinematography, and everything else--that anglade's performance is wasted. sad to see so fine an actor in such a garbage flick.

ok, the very idea is ludicrous.1. kids don't own planes 2. kids don't race planes with dirtbikes 3. it made the air force look like total idiots 4. the kids father would not jeopardize his entire career to allow his boy to joyride with him 5. neither would a reserve colonelthe sequels, i am sure were worse than this tripe. the soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this waste of celluloid. i am sorry but i just don't understand why in the world anyone would write direct and produce such unbelevable junk. the iranian air force is lucky to filtch a couple parts for an ageing f-14, and this kid wrangles not 1 but 2 fully loaded and fueled f-16s? gimme a break.

i still can't belive louis gossett jr. agreed to appear in this film. everything about this move feels artificial, forced, and contrived. the air sequences are flat. the enemy characters seem like puppets. this is just a poor excuse of a movie. at least top gun had air sequences that looked good (the external shots anyway). the songs by queen are cool, though. rent midway instead.

without actually giving away my age, i saw this for the first time over 20 years ago when it first came out on video (maybe it was a beta tape??) and i was old enough to drink (barely) and perhaps i had had a few because i remember thinking how great this movie was! i have since seen it sober and have to admit it is a pretty bad film. as mentioned in other posts the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor acting just makes it worse. it's a poor attempt to fantasize that teenagers too, can be "mavericks" (although i am surprised to find out it actually was to be released the same time (aprox) as "top gun", and not actually meant to be a poor imitation.) but for all it's worth - i do find myself watching it if it's on and i have the time. it's one of those movies you watch because it's just so ridiculous and tries so desperately to take itself seriously. like that other "great' film - "moment by moment" with john travolta and lily tomlin....don't get me started on that one!

"problem child 2" was a complete waste of my time. the original film wasn't very good but its a classic compared to this film. the first film went over the top with its scenes of a devilish child wrecking major havoc in the lives of everyone he's around. here, it goes even further over the top. and one scene in this movie proves that theory. that carnival ride sequence was too much for me to stomach. it's awful. this movie shouldn't have been made.1/2* (out of four)

seriously! you've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. it came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (the little rascals; mr. nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired cliché's this movie enjoys. to put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing. the lines we receive are reminiscent of disney classics, although this film lacks the whole-heartedness il' walt managed to pull off. junior's dad, (john ritter) makes you mad without even doing anything, simply because he allows junior to run around unsupervised, and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200-pound behemoth to a chalk board. also, junior's grandfather is particularly excruciating. for those of you who saw the first one, found it nauseating, and thus, did not see the second one, "big ben healy" as he is referred to in this movie, is still a total douche. he basically barges into john ritter's house uninvited, settles himself in junior's room, even though he says that he hates junior, and basically does nothing to accelerate the film's speed, or to support the film in any way. rather, he ticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader.finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as the smug, obnoxious, trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, which she first lights, then hands, to junior, who simply stares wide eyed at. also, gilbert gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the obnoxious principal at junior's new elementary school. if gilbert gottfried ain't enough to get the point across, i will put it simply: this film reeks!2/10 stars, because the actor's convictions shine through the film, even though the script sucks.

this was just an awful movie. i've watched it once when i was roughly 12, i am now 19 and i don't think i will ever forget this movie.i still feel sick whenever i think about it, it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie. i really don't understand what kind of person would enjoy this utter rubbish. it's not enough to simply turn off your mind to enjoy this movie, i can enjoy the dumbest made-for-tv disney movies as much as the next person, but this is something else completely.usually i don't like to judge a movie until i have seen it myself, but believe me i am doing you a favour. do not watch this movie.

i saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie. the way michael oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance i cannot bare. junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father ben madly insane. also the crazy dance ride operator is not fair to junior for not letting him go on the ride. and that lawanda dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to junior because she made threatening insults to junior which is why i cannot tolerate this movie. even if the movie is re-released back into theatres in the extended version, i still would not see this movie because this movie is not something i can even tolerate. in fact, it stinks!

this sequel to problem child is just as bad as the first one. it still teaches kids that it's o.k. to be bad. it's impossible for me to recommend this movie to anyone.

and nothing else.one of my friends bought the problem child tantrum pack (contains the first two "problem child"s in one disc), and we decided to watch the sequel because it was "funnier".there were many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that's all i need to say.), nippy the dog after eating chow down, and numerous others. the movie is nothing but toilet humor, but it's hilarious. other than the funny moments, though, this movie has little to offer.john ritter annoys the crap out of me, because it sounds like he's reading out of a book. the man can't act in this one, sorry.although i can't say if i would find the movie funny now...(we were blown when we watched it), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day...but nothing else. don't expect oscar material on this one, guys.

everyone has their choice for "worst movie they've ever seen." some like to pick on gigli or battlefield earth. some pick on classics like plan 9 from outer space. ever since i was 14 i have been very vocal in saying that to me, it is problem child 2, and 9 years later, i feel the exact same way. it's not "one of the worst," it's not just an expression. it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen.how much farting, pooping, peeing, and puking can you put in a single movie? i don't need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist! why is it that i'm so hard on this filth? i have nothing against bathroom or gross-out humor. heck, i like the american pie movies. having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the true tipping point is to do it with kids! having little kids call each other sexual names (imdb won't even let me post that word on here, yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds. think of the irony in that!) and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier. worst line in the movie: "i guess i should fart in more people's offices." what other film has: urination into lemonade, dynamite sticks exploding toilets, a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house, and a little girl joking about scratching testicles? however, my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride, says: "i'm gonna puke," opens her mouth, and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle! the puking scene in scary movie 2 looked more real than that. i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert gottfried. you get the impression that he didn't even have a script, but was just being his usual self. too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him.you know what? thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom. goodbye!

this was the second mst3k'd movie i ever saw, and still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilariously awful film experiences you are ever going to have. miles o'keeffe (sp?) is in this, using his chiseled physique to score another payment on the mortgage on his condominium. he's stiff, wooden, and unconvincing, but he still comes across as a cool, likable guy, and at least he's photogenic. that's the only decent i can find to say about the movie, so i thought i would get it out of the way right up front. the fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from being a "1 out of 10". in no particular order, examples of how badly put together this film is:1)ok, the tanya roberts clone (mila) quests to 'the ends of the earth' to find ator, which takes 3 minutes of screen time, including the time she spends stumbling around dying from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder (which i assume would have slowed her down quite a bit). so ator heals her up, and takes his trusty aid thong and sets out to go back to the her castle...and proceeds to take the next 50+ minutes of the movie recovering the ground that mila traversed in 3 minutes. how does that work??? i know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc. on the way back, but still...!2)apparently the writer/director felt the need to add 'depth' to the film by adding a running debate/socratic dialog/game of 20 questions between zor (the mean john saxon wannabe) and the wise man akronas (the richard harris wannabe). but joe damoto apparently got his philosophical training from hallmark cards, t-shirts and bumper stickers, and he doesn't understand tempo, pacing, or timing...and neither do the actors. (crow's remark during one of these exchanges is the tag line for my entry). the scenes with these two drag on and on, bringing the movie to a screeching halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the sword-fighting and questing of the heroic trio.3) once ator arrives at the castle (and is captured), things go even farther downhill. zor decides to feed a bunch of women victims, along with ator and mila, to the serpent god he keeps in his basement. this scene had some potential for excitement, so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the dmv to pay their traffic fines. ator proceeds to have a big battle with the serpent that is barely more convincing than bela lugosi's battle with the rubber octopus puppet in "bride of the monster". 4) the climactic scene, in which ator invents the hang glider out of twigs and animal skins, is so patently silly that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the floor, laughing until your sides hurt. 5) oh, yes, and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of an atomic explosion at the end, with the moral that ator decided to destroy the 'atomic nucleus' mcguffin that drives the movie because mankind was 'not ready'. ("zzzzip! message coming in!!!") just like "bride of the monster" again, come to think of it. all it needed was a bystander to observe, "they tampered in god's domain."6) for some reason, the version of the movie i saw features introductory and closing homo-erotic credit sequences that have absolutely nothing to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. i have no idea where this footage came from, but it is actually worse than the actual movie it bookends. watch this only if you are a big fan of miles, or if you enjoy the way mst3k skewers material like this.

the credits come from the sandy frank stitching job that was made to turn this movie into cave dwellers for re-release. now that that's cleared up...oh! excruciating, eye-gouging pain. blade master leaps shamelessly on the sword & sorcery bandwagon started by the conan flicks...except the bandwagon never left the garage anyway. as such, this italian flick is a dud trying to rip-off a box office dud, with predictable results. however, this would give too little credit to the director and writers, who make no effort whatsoever to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any semblance of era-accurate continuity. miles o'keefe is no leading man, now or forever (tarzan the ape man proved that, if ator didn't). just an unlikeable picture and a chore to watch.

this is about one of the worst movies i'd ever seen. it's not the worst though - manos the hands of fate holds that honor.this movie has a lot of problems. to begin, this whole movie is a cheap rip-off of the conan movies. there's the babe in a skimpy dress wearing a hubcap, the quiet asian warrior, the cookie cutter bad guy, the almost mindless soliders, and so on. there's lots of continuity errors in this film. some of the dumbest errors i've ever seen are in this film.fortunately when i watched this film i seen the mst3k version. joel and the 'bots make the film watchable, otherwise i probably would've turned it off five minutes into the film.

boooooooorrrrrinngggggggg and stooooooopiddddd. kept falling asleep. if you want to see miles o'keefe loping around in a furry speedo by all means rent this movie. if not please don't bother... rife with anachronisms. was this supposed to be set in the ice age, the iron age, the steel age or the age of reason? what was the reason for the black nylon wig on the guy dressed up as genghis khan? was that really supposed to be genghis khan? if ator had access to so much advanced technology and science why did we have wait another 1000 years for leonardo? it's never clear where ator comes from or if he's supposed to be some superior sort of being. you wonder if it was all explained in the first movie but after seeing this one you know you'll never bother.

(spoilers) horrifyingly enough, i have actually seen the film that this horrid film was a sequel to. it was called ator the fighting eagle, and i saw it when i was just 8 years old. it made such an awful impression on me that i never forgot it. i've been an mst3k fan for a long time, so when cavedwellers came out on tape i bought it. i was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the wretched ator movie that i'd seen so long ago! ator's costume has, somehow, gotten ever skimpier than the last time i saw him. how can he wear that tiny little bikini? doesn't he care that it shows off the fact that he has no...errr...package? and poor thong...he gets no lines and no girl, and has to follow that frizzy haired girly doofus ator around all the time. has anyone else noticed that miles o'keefe walks like a woman? no wonder he's not interested in the pretty if somewhat lackluster meela. the evil but prancy bad guy zor is more to his taste, i'm sure. i loved zor's cardboard spray painted swan helmet, and the way he spent all his time trying to touch some part of ator. the fight scenes are so badly choreographed that its a wonder that the swords ever manage to connect. the dull old guy spends all of his time standing around looking depressed. ator drinks from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him, and then looks surprised that they drugged him. he must be pretty smart though-he invented a hang glider in the space pf five minutes ,then flew it into a rift in the space/time continuum so that he travelled briefly into 17th century bulgaria. that was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet, of course, and saved the post coital meela while she sat around doing absolutely nothing. the real hero of the movie was thong, who saved ator several times from his boundless stupiditiy, and killed the evil zor in the bargain. kudos to thong, the only competent person in the whole film.

i mean, you just have to love the italian film industry. someone came up with a post-doomsday action movie ("road warrior") and the italians were busy for years doing one rip-off after another. then some other one came up with a successful barbarian movie ("conan") and the italians were busy... eh, see above.besides countless other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is umberto lenzi's "the barbarians" starring the paul twins) the ator series was created. and this, the second one, is probably the worst (or best, depending on your point of view).ator is called back into action by his old teacher, who has discovered some kind of nuclear power that, of course, has to be protected so it won't get into wrong hands. the old man sends his daughter to ator, and after a few complications ator, his sidekick tong and the girl set back to the castle, which meanwhile has fallen to some evildoer (of course, an old "class mate" of ator). somewhere along the way the heroic trio forgets about the plot and eradicates some giant snake-worshipping cult for the fun of it (not before some virgins are sacrificed). just in time before the madman finally loses his temper and kills the wise teacher our heroes remember their duties, invent hanggliding and grenades and save the day.included: terrible acting by all participants (especially o'keeffe), incredibly hilarious "special effects" (you just have to adore the snake fight scene, which must be sort of a hommage to "bride of the monster"), badly staged fight scenes, numerous continuity errors (ator flies two different hanggliders during the climatic battle, watch for it, just an example) and an overall non-understanding of the concept of history (cavemen, "civilized" barbarians, castle-builders, all thrown in one film).if you're, like me, devoted to bad movies, this is the one of the series to see, you'll probably end up rotfl. for the records: the malta-filmed third part is actually quite watchable.considering joe d'amato's other efforts this is probably his most entertaining movie, as he certainly has failed to deliver watchable horror or erotic movies. but i strongly have the opinion that this was completely by accident.

yes this movie is obviously trying to be a conan the barbarian, and what amazes me is that this is a sequel (the people demanded another one?). the first part of the flick is a flashback showing the original. from what i saw it doesn't look worth checking out (and apparently ator always kills a huge puppet in his movies). well now ator lives at the ends of the earth with his mute sidekick thong. a girl seeks his help as this evil dude has her father in his custody. let me just say this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the villian and just prattles on endlessly. the bad guy waits to the very end of the movie and finally smacks the old guy around leaving you to wonder "what took him so long to snap?". meanwhile, ator and his sidekick and the gal go through one adventure after another. they fight cavemen, invisible soldiers (don't ask), rent a thugs, and people who worship snakes. ator also battles a giant snake puppet and hang-glides (again, don't ask). all the while you will be thinking that conan would kick ator's butt.

good grief.. to think i've seen it all.. danny thomas looks so out of place in this mishmash. he seems really uncomfortable. he can't sing worth a lick, and when he's paired up with peggy lee (peggy lee???) she easily.. easily outsings him! maybe the director saw this and made him do the reall really bad comedy routines that he sometimes does in the film. peggy lee is okay, but the whole thing is a shambles. good for a laugh, maybe.

if you are a pauly shore fan, you will laugh your butt off. if not, this is a silly mess wasting some very good talent. a cute coed(carla gugino)from south dakota invites her california college dorm counselor(shore) home to share thanksgiving. notable cast members: lane smith, cindy pickett, mason adams and the drop dead gorgeous tiffani-amber thiessen. watch where you step.

this movie is one of the worse movies of all time. i'm kind of upset this movie isn't on the bottom 100; it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list. this isn't just a film i think is bad in a campy-fun sort of mst3k way; it's just bad. this is one of the few films that i really, really hate. freddy got fingered is in the same category of bad.so the story in this one goes that the daughter (gugino) goes to california to go to school and comes back with crawl (shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. then the boyfriend tries to set shore up so that the girl will leave crawl and go back to him. it ends and what's left of the audience can leave.the main purpose of this movie is for pauly shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny; but i'd say about 100% of the time he fails at that. their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and there's nothing in this movie worth seeing. if you think of seeing it: don't. the one time i saw the movie it felt like i was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. if you've already seen it; you have my sympathy.

on his recent maligned reality-show, mr. shore conceded his filmic oeuvre is best enjoyed stoned. no, he must have said "best watched." while a healthy toke might see you through the end credits, there is little pleasure to be found, save some sporadic chuckling at the picture, not with it. titular hyphenate absence is the least grievance. other hyphenate, wholesome tiffani-amber thiessen (i dare you to rub out that "saved by the bell" patina of purity) is miscast as a rural vamp; she's too round of face for treachery. mr. shore, himself occasionally displays the odd talent for mimicry (i thought i recognized a jimmy stewart in there), however it is never aptly used. the trite fish-out-of-water formula has yet to be rendered with less grace. our hero, crawl has precious little wit to account for expeditiously charming his agrarian antagonists. ultimately, i had to announce it's been ascertained: the worst movie ever. p.s. as another fish, adam sandler fared better with "mr. deeds." it may take a shore to appreciate a sandler.

it amazes me that anyone would find pauly shore entertaining: he is basically one joke that gets stale *real* fast. he has his little "california" jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of lame jokes. mainly, he is just obnoxious.that said, i watched this movie because i was up sick and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials, otherwise i would have turned it off after 30 minutes. anyway, the film could have been ok if pauly could have just turned off his spiel and just played it as a comic actor instead of, well, pauly. anyway, i'm sure pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you are not a pauly fan, stay away from this crock of manure.i had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 10/10! (maybe it was pauly!!) personally, i gave it a 3/10 because they didn't have any mike-in-frame shots, didn't drop the camera, and the supporting cast was pretty good.

perfect double bill for the horribly corny "beverly hillbillies" is this equally atrocious, lame brained 'comedy', "son in law". country girl rebecca goes to wild california to attend college, only to be assaulted by the lifestyle. 'resident adviser' "crawl" helps her settle in, and soon the two are good friends. bec decides to bring the wacky "crawl" home for thanksgiving, with obvious "fish out of water" results.the only other comic angle steve rash (aptly named ) achieves here is a sexual one. this he bludgeons us with, but to no avail. both comic aspects fail dismally, and you know the film is groping when "crawl" hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn field.dramatically the movie falls short too, with several attempts at family and personal counselling from "crawl" misfiring. between them pauly shore and carla gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are mere fodder. the problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like "crawl", and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why rebecca would want to spend a moment with him. however, if you're a fan of unintelligent comedy, "son in law" is right on the mark.sunday, november 10, 1996 - t.v.

the wind. easily one of the worst films ever made. the only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel, is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes indy horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too. i mean, if this represents the market for indy horror, i could make a fortune videotaping myself taking out the garbage for 83 minutes. a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out. but, the highlites are: no story, terrible acting, awful cinematography, and virtually no editing. that last one bothered me the most. as an editor myself, this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all. every scene was shot in a master. they had absolutely no coverage at all. for anyone who doesn't know..."coverage" is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to make for a desirable viewing experience. yeah, this movie had none of that. i'm talking about even the simplest of scenes. example: an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing who's in the scene and where they are. then, as the conversation goes on, you would cut back and forth to over-the-shoulder shots as the conversation continues. you may even throw in a cutaway shot or two of something on the table, or in someone's hand. anything. this is "film 101" stuff guys. it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work. every shot was a camera lock-down. no movement, no cutting, no nothing. if i was teaching a course in filmmaking, this would be the visual aid for my "what not to do" lesson.in closing, don't waste your time folks. the only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at all. 

alright this movie might have been good if there was a plot behind it. the title didn't even fit the it after the first ten minutes. the wind didn't have a whole lot to do with the rest of the movie. the acting was sub-par and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories. as far as horror movies go this shouldn't even be classified as one. this was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere. i hate to be so harsh but i felt i want the time i spent watching this movie back. hopefully there will not be a follow up to this. this movie should be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing.

ok, i wanted to see this because it had a few good reviews, but this movie was awful... just plain awful. the characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them. the story was abysmal... the wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through... it just completely becomes forgotten. the visuals while were cool were sooooo drawn out... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground, 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup. i don't know what this guy is trying to pull off... it's like he had no plot no dialog and the movie needed to run just so long so lets not edit scenes at all... foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialog, this movie makes me think that there is no way american cinema can ever do this. i want to give up watching movies altogether... bad bad movie!

somewhere in usa, the young clair manipulates her friends mic, billy and john, showing a letter that would be sent by bob to her and the group cowardly beats bob and mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. mic feels sorrow and decides to tell his mother what he did, but john and billy threaten him, with tragic consequences.i believe "the wind" is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. the awful screenplay is ridiculous, and it is almost impossible to write a summary, since there is no story or plot, only sequences of disconnected scenes. the amateurish direction and acting are amazingly poor and terrible. it is unbelievable how producers invest money in such garbage, distributors release this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this dvd. i waited until the very last scene because i was curious to see how bad this film could be and i was impressed, since it is worse than i could imagine in my lowest expectations. in the end, i question why imdb does not offer zero in the vote system, since the garbage really deserves this vote. my vote is one.title (brazil): "força invisível" ("invisible force")

every james bond movie has its own set of rules. just like every indiana jones movie has its own set of rules. and the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. with a completely unnecessary plot twist, the integrity of both ocean films plummets somewhere between airplane 2 and a roadrunner cartoon.imagine what would happen, while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the temple of doom, if indy told shorty and willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.entertaining? sure, for a roadrunner cartoon. but spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. more importantly, it would have angered the audience. they'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of indiana jones movies and they were counting on indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. if he were to fly off? people would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during ocean's 12.spoilers1. julia roberts'character, tess, infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as...julia roberts?!? a clever twist? by breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters? is this the naked gun 33 and 1/3? it's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film. but wait...just in case you haven't walked out yet...2. the suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie -- how will they pull off the heist -- there are only 10...8...5...2 days left! and then in the last 12 minutes of the film, the only entertaining part of this movie, we see that the heist was made days earlier and took matt damon all of 30 seconds to pull off. the past 10 days? a complete waste of your time.back to indiana jones on the rope bridge..."just relax, willie! i stole the real stones back about a month ago! besides, i convinced them you were kate capshaw!"if you haven't already seen it, cut your losses and go see the polar express. i don't want to ruin the ending for you, but there really is a santa claus. most importantly, you won't feel cheated leaving the theater.

i have never seen a b movie like this one... on the part that the nanny sofia is being killed... a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick... how bad is that??? lol, i seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie, but i kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse...lol...it is bad for itself... poor pinocchio.. the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of pinocchio's face moving... apart from that the whole movie is awful... it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to spare! but if you have nothing to do... go on... treat yourself with some "z" movie cos b-movie is still too good for this one...lol

i was really disappointed after viewing pinocchio's revenge the other night. i had a good inclination that it was going to be a bad one, but i didn't think that it'd be as bad as it turned out. a wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an attorney's eight-year-old daughter. from there, it is a murderous path for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the little girl. we've seen movies like this before, i.e. the child's play series, which is by the way, far better. however, it was good to see actors like james w. quinn and todd allen. both of which have worked under kevin tenney before. in any event, i encourage viewers to check out "night of the demons" and the original "witchboard." these are titles that tend to bring out the best in kevin s. tenney.

pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. nor is it terrible.the acting was wooden at least on pinocchio's part.the puppet had all of 2 expressions.as did most of the actors,except strangely enough...the secondary characters...most of them were enjoyable over the top.the special effects in this are pretty "b" and as i said earlier the puppet really blew.the 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand...looked pretty good,i think they spent about a 1/3 of the budget on that...and the shower scene...wow...i think they must have spent the other 2/3rds of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do it.outstanding.seriously this is a slightly below average "b" horror puppet movie...rent chucky if you have a urge to see puppets kill.the story had a few interesting idea's, enough to keep me watching it to the end.

i had very high hopes walking into this movie. after all, ocean's 11 was a truly great hollywood product. its rapid-fire jokes, incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films i have ever seen. of course, with all the money it made, a sequel was on the way, and i, for one, was excited.needless to say, i was absolutely blown away by this movie. blown away by how horribly wrong things can go. this movie had everything going for it; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news stories of crazy on- and off-set antics. how could it possibly have gone so wrong?it starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. after reasonably goofy short scenes between pitt/zeta-jones and clooney/roberts, the film spends several minutes watching andy garcia waltz from scene to scene, telling each individual member of danny ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. believe me when i say that these scenes are only here to pad andy garcia's running time, because without these ridiculously awkward shots, his screen time would be well under five minutes.this leads me to another major qualm i had with this film. the pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story, and only sometimes brought back later. bernie mac's character is dropped from the script early on, and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. garcia appears for the first few minutes, and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning, and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20-25 minutes left. even clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison.this would all be excusable if the film was funny. at all. 90% of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best. the "plot" is undeniably worthless, and left me feeling cheated. at one point in the film, the team takes on a job worth $2.5 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before garcia's two-week deadline. several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is, but they do it anyway! over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. furthermore, the equipment they use to pull this job off clearly cost millions upon millions to fund. just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $2.5 million to pull off. obviously, because of this, they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. the beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. here, they pull so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.we all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. thus is the nature of the caper film. the twist at the end of ocean's twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because i couldn't believe how cheated i felt. i won't give it away, because i know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.what i will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.i was excited to see this film, after absolutely adoring ocean's 11. i left the theater feeling like i had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. i have never given a 1 to a movie on imdb.com, but there's a first time for everything. consider yourselves warned....1/10

child´s play made a new genre of horror,the killer dolls,some of this films has not got too much money for make it but i think that the only film that make shadow to chucky is this.ok it´s a tipical product direct to video or direct to tv but pinocchio is not real and the killer is the little girl.the imagination of children are too big and this film play with it.the roles are good and candance mckenzie is great.

this seemed really similar to the child's play movies except so much worse. a lawyer tries to save a criminal, who was convicted of killing his son, from execution. she fails. the lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the killer had buried with his son and is immediately attached to it. then after several people are seriously injured they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll saying that she didn't hurt anyone. throughout this movie i found myself asking myself ' why am i watching this cheeze?' over and over. the end sucked so bad that i went and watched the disney cartoon version right after and slept with the light on.

when i first heard about this movie, i eagerly went out to rent it, believing (mistakenly) that it was one of those so-bad-it's-fun movies and that i was in for a treat. i was wrong.for starters, the pace is agonizingly, mind-numbingly slow. the pace doesn't even begin to pick up until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! the plot was boring, and the ending was nonsensical and confusing. for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills, look elsewhere. this movie provides the cheesiness in spades, but is sorely lacking in "thrills," cheap or otherwise.try "child's play," instead.

i bought this movie hoping that it would be another great killer toy movie. i am a big fan of the child's play series and was hoping to see the same here. boy, was i wrong. most of the movie was not the least bit scary, plus the only time we really see pinocchio "alive" is the final few scenes of the film. the little girl in the film, her acting is so bad it's almost laughable. plus, the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what made them put the little girl in a asylum or wherever she was at the end of the film. so, in my opinion this movie is the worst of the "killer toy" genre. if you want a good killer toy series, stick with the child's play franchise. pinocchio's revenge is a waste of money and time.

about one step above an olsen's twins film, there's a nary a surprise in store here except for how repulsive the bloated, hunchbacked depardieu looks walking around the beach without a shirt on. this guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob? quasimodo hubba hubba? well, whatever.katherine heigl's a great actress, whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress, but this movie definitely didn't do anything to offer her a break-out role. her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self-esteem, spending her entire vacation crushing on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world (basically because he's a cute boy), yet she can't be honest with him for two seconds. ladies, let me tell you something; if a guy's really into you, he's not going to stomp off in a huff because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend. he may be a little confused about why you'd do something so silly, contrived, and um...incestuous, but in the end it's just going to be something you'll laugh together about.the plot and dialogue hits every clche' right on cue. no originality and no wit...but it's rilly, rilly sweet and ben's rilly, rilly cute so viewers who think titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they won't notice that it doesn't have a brain in its head. one star.

i have really enjoyed several movies by gérard depardieu and expected i'd like this movie a lot more than i did. the biggest reason was that i just didn't find the movie very interesting or funny--so, it didn't hold my interest. also, although he does not sleep with his headstrong daughter, the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain icky! yes, i know there is no incest and i know that nobody around them knows he really is her father, but i found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from truly being funny. in addition, i really didn't like this little brat very much. apart from her lies, she seemed very sassy and self-involved. i would have preferred if somehow she'd gotten her "come-uppance" and somehow been punished, as i just didn't like her.

and parading around a 14-year-old girl in a thong swimsuit is one of them. to fans of this movie, i'd like to ask: would you allow your daughter to walk around a resort dressed like that? and would your 14-year-old be able to handle the reaction she'd get from men? if yes, i'd like to know why, on both counts. a suit like that is a clear invitation to men; it's hypocritical to suggest that's not. and on another point, what teenage girl would ever claim her father was her lover, without the excuse of severe mental problems? that's almost as disgusting as the swimsuit. simply put, some things are just not funny or appropriate, and they never will be.

i couldn't stand to watch very much of this crap. this is your standard junk that certain annoying women love- old english era drama with lots of costumes and cliché characters that seem to be plucked from either directly from oliver twist or some other dickens novel. this uses the usual clichés from the victorian era. certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture being so bloody repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic. this is sap, pure and utter junk and boring as watching grass grow. as such it is perfect for women who crave some sort of english countryside snoozer romantic drama in a victorian setting but for this man this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to watch a bunch of drab boring scenes with unoriginal characters speaking in that wretched forced and fake english accent.

i thought it was comedy!! what a hoot! i can't believe forsythe or reynolds would actually appear in this piece of trash..and then there's the beautiful erika eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is called..appears she put on a few pounds since her playboy centerfold..like about 50!! the story line is ludicrous, the acting absolutely horrendous, and the tired old cliché's that are run over and over and over again, boy it took a lot of stamina to sit through this dog..the only thing worth it was the laughs!! and there are plenty! if you really want to kill say, an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop, but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you. i think that's who it was written for.. it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent, drug induced audience for this one..

question: how does a film merit two different titles like "the librarians" and "strike force"? answer: the film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on a title!!!! this film is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death wish-vendettas, melodrama, romance, and other cliché film techniques. the story focuses on a vigilante group called the librarians led by agent simon (william forsythe). the group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious, multi-lingual, pockmarked creature named marcos (andrew divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south florida. burt reynolds appears as a cameo in this film, and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action. burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls i have ever heard. this may have been burt's attempt at an irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of marlon brando in "the godfather." also appearing in this film is erika eleniak, who has infiltrated the inner circle of marcos' bizarre world. erika's character kick-boxes her way into an alliance with simon. the librarians and erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable tv converter box.

all things old are new again.erika e. is on celebrity fitness (vh1);florida state rep. mark foley is the national buzz for allegedly sending sexually explicit emails to a 16 yr. old male page.as i edit this mr.foley is resigning from his representative seat. mr.foley you see does his turn at acting as the father of the recovered girl seen during the opening sequence. my place in movie history will forever be solidified with my appearance in the graveyard scene.i should have looked at this as a omen.i hate to say it but be warned if you place this in your dvd be prepare to put your toe on the trigger of the shotgun you'll soon have between your teeth. your level of depression has reached its zenith.i have seen better writing put to screen on an etch a sketch.shot in 1999-00 under the working title "the librarians" in and around palm beach co.why the librarian's you ask,well you would need to be wrapped as tight as binding to be able to read anything into this frat party of over the hill stunt men plying their trade onto celluloid for one last time.oh well enough with the accolades...burt reynolds as a irish mobster, in miami no less...possibly the worst forced accent impression since linda lovelace in "deep throat". .william forsythe as a hip, slick and cool tough guy...doubtful,possibly 10 years ago.i'd say it's curtain time for mike kirton.you now have the forsythe to pass up this sub par movie,more like a film school project, for anything on tape,disc or paper your local retailer has to offer.

as stated by others, this is a ludicrously horrible movie (not a film!). it is not bad in a funny way, just painful to try to endure. don't waste your time.erika eleniak is pretty hot, but there is one scene where she is in a bathtub, and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles. also, she's getting fat.the fight scenes are so bad as to be unwatchable, if you know or care anything about martial arts, or even decent choreography, and the editing/effects are abysmal.there is no payoff, it goes nowhere, and sucks getting there.

i want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically, the english subtitle translation), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. but if so, director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke.some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style (e.g., david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky). others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g., krzysztof kieslowski, and david cronenberg's later, less bizarre works). in pola x, carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. i liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to andy warhol's 'factory' of the '60s?). much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. and, even well into middle-age, cathering deneuve shows that she still has 'it'. her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos.there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as "pola x" more charitably. experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment doesn't work. but carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later, i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe. at this early moment in the 21st century, one is left asking: with the exception of jean-pierre jeunet, are there *any* directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore? rating: 3/10.

i must, in light of the encomia of praise for this flick from viewers, assume once again the role of the turd in the punchbowl, as lowell weicker used to say, i am scratching my head at the sheer number of laudatory comments. "the african queen" this ain't. the period flavor is wonderful, yes. the acting is fine, but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here, and i care not how much of it is taken from joyce's text. imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people (it's not clear to me that it's a family, as one person suggested), having to listen to their mundane table talk, and you have the essential experience of this movie. absolutely nothing happens. and nothing important is said, but it is said at interminable length. as i said, the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me. speaking of mysteries, watch a good one rather than this.

some guy named karl rhamarevich learns how to live on even after death through telekinesis. he's interred in a mausoleum. that same night julie (meg tilly) has to spend the night there to get into a group called "the sisters". and karl's "power" is in full bloom.silly movie. i saw it in a theatre when i was 21 and was generally bored. the pg rating should have tipped me off--this is a horror movie for kids. one real stupid scene at the end has a corpse breaking through concrete to hit a young guy! for starters corpses are put in head first making it impossible for the corpse to use his arms and there's no way anybody is going to break through concrete. when you're noticing silly mistakes like that, the movie is not doing its job.it has two good scenes--two of "the sisters" are "attacked" by floating corpses crowding them in. at one point one of the sisters punches a corpse in the stomach--her hand goes in the body and she can't pull it out! that scene has stayed with me every since. and there's a cute little bit involving a corpse and a toothbrush at the end (which had my audience laughing). but the rest of the movie is a dim, dull memory. for kids only--adults will be bored. i give it a 3.

i saw this on a cheap dvd release with the title "the entity force". since i enjoy cheesy 80's horror films i thought i was in for a real treat. sadly the film is mostly boring and you're constantly waiting for something to happen. it does eventually get somewhat interesting, but this is in the last quarter of the film. it's a case of too little too late. when the action does happen it's not that great, what we get are dead corpses 'floating' along the ground and chasing after the girls in the mausoleum. it's not the absolute worst i've seen, but you can do a lot better. i would only recommend this to die-hard collectors of cheesy 80's horror.

i received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21st birthday, which he had obviously picked up for 99p from a bargain video bin.never have i been so frustrated when watching a film - it was tedious, adam west was wasted (literally) and, in retrospect, i cannot recall a single thing about it. my lack of enjoyment grew to such an extent that the second the credits rolled we smashed up the cassette and hung the tape around the living room. just for good measure, we set fire to the cover.

when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here. then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called "mausolem" instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common. however, reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about. i will be honest, i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree. however, there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to. the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party, in this case it is in fact a mausoleum. the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too, still it was just not the movie i was expecting.

i had never even heard of one dark night until someone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently, and reading into it, i gained interest due to meg tilly's involvement and recognizing that it was an early gig for friday the 13th vi:jason lives director tom mcloughlin . unfortunately, sad to say, it's nothing special. the premise has a familiarity to it:a college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until morning in order to join a sorority. that girl is a young meg tilly, as julie, who wishes to prove to her loving, caring boyfriend, steve(david mason daniels)that she can make his cruel, conniving ex-girlfriend, carol's(robin evans)sorority regardless of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail. along with carol's gang is kitty(leslie speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and leslie(elizabeth daily)who doesn't really wish to cause julie such trouble. while leslie insists on leaving julie alone as she remains in the mausoleum, carol and kitty plan to torment the poor girl. meanwhile steve searches for her while julie, carol and kitty encounter an evil they couldn't possibly imagine..the corpse of a recently diseased "psychic vampire", whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree, will seek to drain them of their very lifeforce. the only one who can help these girls is the dead man's daughter, olivia(melissa newman)who is equipped with the same psychic power he has.i think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum, it's certainly different than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at this time. like adam west's character(..he was the cynical husband of olivia who found the idea of her father's power ridiculous), i had a really hard time adjusting to the tacky plot, and i personally never found anything within the film to get excited about. the mausoleum to me never really was that spooky(..it doesn't really achieve the same kind of eerie quality phantasm captured) and the corpses which are used to attack the girls are laughably unconvincing(..there is one great scene where a corpse's face melts away). i have a soft spot for low budget films from this period of time, but i just never really could find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting electric bolts from it's eyes causing other bodies to break free from their crypts to obey their master. it's just too silly to take seriously. carol is your typical blond bitch wishing to punish a nice girl who is dating a former flame. steve is your typical, squeaky clean all-american boyfriend, handsome and tender, who becomes the hero seeking to save his girl from whatever sinister forces are at play. to make up for the small budget director mcloughlin tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience, using a series of ooga-booga effects such as corpses which pursue young girls, chairs which shake and tremble, doors that slam shut, and objects levitating by themselves. the film obviously has it's fans, and i am glad i had a chance to see it, but i was a bit disappointed that one dark night wasn't the horror sleeper i hoped for. adam west has a very small role as the concerned husband hoping his wife will snap out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her. melissa newman is the troubled olivia, recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all or else he'd continue to prey on the living. donald hotton is dockstader, an associate of olivia's father's who informs her of what he was. i wasn't particularly blown away by tilly's performance here(..she was basically scared most of the time), but she'd get a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point onward. this will undoubtedly be of some value to those who watched it back at that time, for nostalgia purposes it might seduce fans of movies from this era.

i attended the premier last night. the movie started out with a bang (perhaps due to pre-premier excitement). the audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep. this movie can not be compared to _spinal tap_ or any of guest's work, unless you want to say _sons of provo_ is a wanna-be gone awfully wrong. it just fell flat, it died, it was painful. the story went nowhere, the jokes were bland, even if you were a mormon and could get all of the inside jokes, it felt like a waste of time. there were two redeeming qualities: kirby's acting was spot on! and the songs were very clever (for an lds audience only). so, my recommendations... avoid the movie. and if you are mormon, buy the music cd.

this movie was very disappointing, and except for a few moments, wasn't fly at all. more than anything, it was just flippin' stupid. the music was frickin' bad and the plot played out like a byu bowl game  very predictable (avoiding embarrassment by scoring, a late game flurry of touchdowns, a rally that falls short and leads to a loss). in essence, the half-childish / half-naive will (the movie's fetcher) and his religiously confused brother danny (we'll just call him a democrat), treat kirby (the movie's "sweet spirit"), the 3rd member of their hapless mormon "boy band," like crap until the man and father figure of the film (the stage manager, jill) has a talk with will and straightens him out. believably, will's personality changes 180 degrees and he's instantly the mature and self-aware leader of the band. this would be a cute, perhaps funny, 10 minute roadshow gig, but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end. my advise  take the money you'd normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet  more entertainment with much less time commitment. if you want to watch a better movie of the same genre, get saints and soldiers  not a comedy but an infinitely better show (actually, kirby has more funny stuff in saints than he does in sop).

i just can't imagine any possible reasons why madsen and hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. they got blackmailed maybe? or are they that badly out of money? the main problem with the movie is that it's boring. the conversations between madsen's and hopper's character are pointless, just like the bored chatting between two buddies while drinking beer on a saturday night. you never feel for any of the characters (although madsen's psycho killer is very likeable, comparing to the other characters). hopper always was a good actor, and madsen does a fine job as the serial killer, otherwise the acting is almost laughable. there are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is actually happening, each of them last about three minutes. although the "talking and thinking about murder and the nature of murderers" scenes would have been interesting, if they were scenes in a book. the whole concept would've been interesting for a novel, but a movie just can't bare with a story with that much inner thinking and so little action.

film noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, cleverness, intellect, and imagery. this movie has none of that, though they really tried hard with the imagery.it's the kind of movie that your cousin marky the dump truck driver, who's always talking about how he's going to make it big in the movies someday, would make.the dialogue is wooden and lifeless. the visuals, while obviously expensive to make, are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably due to a severe lack in cerebral ability. the acting ranged from sub-par to just plain bad. the story might have been salvaged by a real writer and director, but i suspect that such people would not have touched it with a barge pole.about 1/4 of the way through, i noticed striking similarities with the scene in sim0ne where viktor, desperate to be rid of his actress, makes the world's worst movie. i figured i'd check imdb to see if a similar effect has occurred in this movie, and to my surprise it has. i'd almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because it's exposed the pretentious groupies, but i won't. it's that bad.

this is the first time i feel the need to comment on imdb, to write some sort of a review and, as it so often happens, it's not because of a really excellent film, but a truly appalling one.take the narrating style the youngest might relate to the max payne video game series, a cast of virtually unkonwns (which is not a bad thing in itself), poor dialogs, some dark scenes but not many enough, and make a film out of it. don't worry about the bad acting, the length (way too long), the lack of immersion (the lead character has to be one of the lest interesting i've seen in a long time - couldn't care less if he died) or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself in.i wouldn't have written anything if it hadn't been for another review here, giving it 10 stars. i gave it four, but maybe three is closer to what i feel about it. not only do i not wish to see it again, but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself. oh, and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. the ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie.it's not romance, it's not action, it's not noir, it's not good. that would be my review if it weren't for the minimum of 10 lines.

this was such a terrible film, almost a comedy sketch of a noir film.the budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but still higher than most.but its where they've decided to cut costs that is totally weird.some actors are at least competent, while others look like they just been dragged off the street.one of them being the lead actor, hes so very bad that i cringed when ever he said anything (he talks through the entire movie).then there's the weird costume choices.at the start of the movie all characters are wearing 1930's clothes.they drive a classic car, but the background is a modern day windfarm thats blatantly state of the art.and the costumes and some settings continue to follow this 30's film noir theme.then bam in drives a brand new escalade with 24 inch rims....wtf.same thing again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle, you get a shot down its sight.hes aiming at a guy with an mp5 and tactical gear on.in a even stranger contrast the locations are brilliant, and seem to have cost more than the rest of the entire film.the camera shots/angles a very good, and show these locations brilliantly in the scenes.the director has a keen eye for a good looking single shot, but no idea how to do much else.people who should be shot for this film▼the writer the director the casting agent the costume designerpeople who should be tortured to death for their monotone, monotonous nails on chalk board voice.▼anton pardoe- the lead actor, writer, producer if you ever seen the movie hostel, i wish that would happen to this guy, but he doesn't escape.

the fifth collaboration between marlene dietrich and director josef von sternberg, blonde venus is a film that looks great while it's playing but fails to engages the viewer. the plodding storyline of dietrich being torn between two men, becoming a mammoth cabaret star, and fighting for the custody of her child is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together. dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive, reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers, while herbert marshal is unconvincing as her ill-tempered husband, and cary grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture. the film does contain some intriguing set pieces (the "hot voodoo" number is the high point) that are impressively surrealistic for this era in hollywood, although it proves to no avail in such a dull, incoherent film.

the plot: a group of young people with ridiculous names (hutch, swink, phineaus, and october)are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend loomis. after the funeral, they decide to divide up their late friend's belongings. among them is a video game called stay alive. the group decides there's no better way to show their grief than to all partake in a little virtual bloodshed. but the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor ol' loomis.the production: this film is just another entry into the latest hollywood craze of low-budget pg-13 horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd. the direction is sloppy to say the least with quick, music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow. the dialog is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. the plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die.the idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. but the poor execution on both sides of the camera make this one big dud.if you've ever got a craving for a "killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life" horror film take my advice and skip stay alive for the superior brainscan.

i was not very excited to see this movie in the first place but a group of us decided to go see it on opening night. i felt like getting up and walking out and attempting to get my money back 20 minutes into this film. i felt that the movie was very boring, uninteresting, and not true in many aspects including "gaming". i tried my best not to fall asleep during the movie as i watched one of the worst horror films i have ever seen. the scary movie series was scarier than this movie. the sad attempt to pull in a gothic girl, an overworked business man, and 15 year old geek, and some random guy into a video game that kills you is a bad plot to begin with. then they try to throw in a very horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered. the theater was packed when the movie started by then end a little over half of the people had left before it was over. if you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time seeing this movie ... prepare to feel cheated.

talk about false advertising! i wasted an hour and twenty five minutes watching this piece of crap and there was not one leisure suit, not one platform shoe, no pointy-finger dancing, and not a single disco ball. i watched it on a saturday night, and ended up with an awful fever, but it had nothing to do with the music.seriously, with or without john travolta, this movie sucked.from the opening scene, you will be asking yourself the question, "where did that rope come from, and will it please hang me, too?" from its unabashed bias against the driving abilities of the pennsylvania dutch, to the shameless promotion of the apparently everlasting capacities of alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects lifted directly from japanese cinema, this is the worst film to hit theaters since the grudge.

after the mysterious death of an old friend,a group of teenagers find themselves in the possession of stay alive,a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of erzebet bathory known as the blood countess.the group begins to play the grisly game and soon they are murdered one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game.as the line between the game world and the reality disappears,our heroes must find a way to defeat vicious blood countess. "stay alive" is an incredibly poor teen slasher flick without any iota of suspense.writer-director william brent bell doesn't have the damn clue how to make a watchable horror movie.the jump scares are irritating,the blood/gore level is almost non-existent and the story doesn't make sense.the dialogue is utterly bad and the acting of all involved is embarrassing."stay alive" is easily one of the worst mainstream horror flicks of 2006.stay away from this stinking turd.

a group of young adults open a plain of escape for the spirit of elizabeth bathory when they recite her poem from a video game supposedly representing a séance. the only one who dies in the game is miller(adam goldberg)who also is found dead the same way he perished in said video game. while the others' characters didn't die in the video game, their reciting her poem has instead unleashed the video game into reality with walking cgi characters stalking and killing each of them, one by one. they must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat bathory and save their skin.if this premise sound stupid, that's because it is. the characters are ho-hum rejects from bad wb television shows, this time allowed to spout profanity. this flick follows the slasher rules, but doesn't show much violence or gore. it stays pg-13 safe with most of the death taking place off-screen. there's a scene where the true hero and heroine are running from video game characters pursuing them. yes, it's that bad. nothing at all to recommend. good-looking cast including sophia bush as the appropriately named october.

in the ring, it was a videotape; a website was the problem in feardotcom; the danger in pulse came from computers; and phone and one missed call featuredyou guessed itdeadly phones. in stay alive, the piece of technology that causes all manner of problems is an online game: those who play it wind up dead soon afterwards. how clever!directed by william brent bell (who?), and featuring an unimpressive cast of twenty-somethings that you might have seen before, but probably can't remember where or what the hell their names are, this is an extremely derivative piece of film-making aimed squarely at the pg-13 horror set; seasoned scary film watchers will no doubt find stay alive extremely tedious, highly predictable and not in the least bit frightening.the poorly developed plot follows a group of gamers with extremely daft names (october, loomis, phineus, hutch, and swink!?!) who attempt to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims. eventually, they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary countess elizabeth bathory who is killing anyone who dares to play, and that their only hope of survival is to continue with the game to the end.with a story as dumb as this, viewers should expect a film with loose ends aplenty, not one iota of logic (who made the game, how, and why is never explained), very little in the way of scares or gore, and a dumb closing scene to leave the door open forgod forbida sequel.

bad, bad movie. when i saw the synopsis i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape. nothing of the sorts happened. i'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it.first of all choosing real life person, countess bathory, is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story. anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this hungarian noblewoman end up in this movie. choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much, much better.then there is whole you-die-in-real-life-as-you-die-in-the-game concept. as i said before interesting, ring-like story. but instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is, why it was created and so on. waste of good idea.and finally this movie doesn't even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable. death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny.avoid if possible.

aside from frankie muniz chattering too fast to understand (malcolm in the middle flashbacks?) this film still cannot conjure up a scare. the idea with the "countess" and the history surrounding her placed into the story was fun but the plot, and many side plots, just don't tie together. plot synopsis: murdering ghost lures victims through video game. toss in some blood spatters and a special effects and you've got yourself another bombed out would be horror flick. the ghost cronies resemble the ghost in "the ring two" far too much. the acting and constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions is unbelievable. save your money.

altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other, because, he says, people do that in life. well, people also cough, burp, go off on tangents, etc. the point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it compelling cinema. that's one issue.the bigger issue is that this just isn't a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire, in 1988 or 2004. garry trudeau is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of republican elected officials is a 60s-style hippie liberal. i mean the guy still trots out zonker in his strip - a character that is a complete anachronism, yet trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large stripe of american youth.don't get me wrong. i am a conservative, but i'm not saying that this is bad because it's got a liberal bent. it could take a liberal tack and be funny and relevant, but it's not. it is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals (including the odious, repellent ron reagan, jr.). at times it feels unscripted, and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self-importance and "aren't we oh-so-clever?"-ness.someone said that this show insists it has a cult following. i think its cult status is more wished-for than actual. i'm certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if that is the standard, then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree. if tanner didn't have the names altman and trudeau attached, it would be another forgotten hbo production from the 1980s. instead, it's presented as hard-hitting, incisive political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game. the reality, however, is about as far from that as possible. pat paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than tanner ever was, and he's been dead for a decade.

this video has audio that is meant for someone to hear during their sleep. and the same can be said for the video.morgan and his wife pretending to rough it at minimum wage jobs? with a camera rolling? and his little wifey-poo complaining? give me a break. they are both rich. they are sitting in their fake $350/month apartment filming this with their $1,000/month each video crew of 12.i used to respect morgan, but now his "30 days" experience is nothing more than trying to fool any volunteer viewers who are willing to be fooled.c'mon morgan, you are being filmed doing a $6.00 an hour job and you are being paid by naive employers who don't see those big cameras filming the whole thing?? and we aren't to think they aren't paying you under the table?

i have only seen the minimum wage episode yet i have no intention of watching the others, how can that be? morgan starts theatrically complaining about his awful situation living on minimum wage right at the beginning of the episode and the complaining never stops. ever. luckily for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as morgan (if not even more annoying).and then to top it all, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2,50 and after that go to a restaurant to eat out all the while they naturally *drumroll* complain about being poor.i don't care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this. no one should be forced to watch this crap.

i saw the episode about living on minimum wage. it went as far as an oprah winfrey's appearance for the said episode. it's bad enough people struggle making ends meet week to week. then having this hypocrite exploiting the problem. i didn't appreciate the constant complaining from him or his significant other, throughout. queston is how any people have the power to pay their medical bills from the er? sure he shows that the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance(from his own pocket) after-wards from his "harrowing" experience. how many poor people have that type of privilege after 30 days to pay off their bills. instead they are starving and "robbing peter to pay paul". complaining throughout the episode isn't a humbling thing for him. the movie and restaurant scene is appalling. another privilege he has that poor people don't.

an "independant" film that, from the back of the box, promises twists, adventure and an emotional adventure we will never forget. this film also fools us into watching it by flaunting rachel lee cook with a starring role. after the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie is going to give you nothing. the story goes on aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested. all three "disturbed" characters have only small grains of back story to force us to care. just as you reach the end, everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience catch up, you are left with no idea, and more importantly, no interest in "why". the director, who also thought it would be a good idea to co-star, seems to come into the film with no prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. the entire piece looks like a college "art" film crafted by a freshman film student trying to hide a lack of true talent.

pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses. rachel leigh cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance, but i would recommend this film only to die-hard fans of the actress.

it is such a shame when actors and actresses of high quality get involved with pure crap, probably because they were offered a great deal of money. not one of helen mirren's better career moves. the acting of the "teens" is simply appalling, not helped by a script that is in parts simply inept.most of kevin williamson's work is above average box office dross, but this is really below par. this is the sort of movie that you watch on tv when there is nothing better on and you have had half a bottle of wine to drink and are waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half.

the only reason i watched this movie a second time, was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl playing opposite katie holms. her name is marisa coughlan. never heard of her before. she is lovely. captivating. with an animated face, and cute bod, she is highly watchable... she's got real, "poisenality"... more than a passing vibe of grace kelly... with youthful exuberance. i think she is irish in gene pool, (my favorite female dna) so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful irish american. the movie is unremarkable, katie holms is classic beauty in the flesh. but marisa coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. in 1999 when this movie was made, she was around 25 years old, in her prime. this reminds me of another silly, worthless movie with the only redemption being the pretty girl in it. it was "career opportunites" with the first time i saw jennifer conoly. or "grease ii" the first time i saw michelle pfeiffer.

you know, i'm getting really tired of all the generic music being used in these type of movies (see jawbreaker, disturbing behavior, etc). every scene of genuine tension here (and there is some) is immediately undercut with some cheesy pop tune, completely diluting the suspense. why do they do that? to sell some soundtracks, of course, but in this case, mission unaccomplished - did anyone buy the cd?and yeah, ms. mirren attacks her role with zest and relish (with some cheez-wiz to add kick). but what are molly, leslie and vivica doing here? their roles (they're so underused that i cannot use "characters" here) have no purpose in the storyline, so i can't figure out why three well-known actresses had been cast.oh, and the ending is so unbelievably hackneyed and irresponsible. the kids get off scot-free and act as if nothing happened - all smiles at graduation. they're criminals, people! no consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, grade tampering) - nothing.little things too - was tingle's tale about her husband true? what's with the crossbow? would the virginal katie character loose her cherry on a whim like that? (great message, guys.) why did mckean go to her home? how did kate's academic nemesis walk through the door at that exact moment? how do students even obtain teachers' home addresses? what's with jeffrey tambor?? on what basis did mckean fire tingle? she's bloodied, battered and held hostage by students, fer cripe's sake!oh well, i'm spending way more thought on the script than mr. williamson apparently did, so i'll stop here.3/10

i made it about halfway through this movie, and at that point realized that i absolutely didn't care how it ended. it is basically a bland teen comedy that i only watched because i like helen mirren, who is in fact very good as an impossibly cruel teacher.the basic idea of the movie (or let's say the first half of the movie, since i don't know - or care - how the second half goes) has been done before, most notably in 9 to 5, and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly tingle gets it wrong. you need to feel things are spiraling out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters who you care about, and you don't have that. not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a second.

this absurd movie was about a "goodie-two-shoe," teen-girl that really wanted to be valedictorian but finds her obstacle in a teacher name mrs. tingle. katie holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe," is faced with "the biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when this classmate guy of hers comes along with the final exams sample that should help them nail mrs. tingle's test. mrs. tingle comes along, catches holmes, the classmate guy and her best friend with the sample of her final exam. convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on here exam, mrs. tingle enthuses on her opportunity to ruin holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of holmes passing her class. and the classmate guy, who apparently has his eye on holmes, always wondered why she never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot)? feeling desperate, holmes and her friends visit mrs. tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her in believing that holmes was planning to cheat. it all backs fire somehow when the classmate guy points a bow and arrow at mrs. tingle, threatening her to make things right for holmes. mrs. tingle fights back but ultimately ends up as holmes and her friend's captive.during mrs. tingle captivity under holmes, they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to blackmailing her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious coach in bed with mrs. tingle. i found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in mrs. tingle's house, eating up her food and going though her private work. at one point, holmes found mrs. tingle's grade book and purposely changes the grade in her favor, decreasing the grade of her challenge for valedictorian. the end played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the film, resolving on pure irony, slapstick and absurdity.this has to be the most unlikable and wickedly evil character holmes would ever play in her entire life. i wanted to help mrs. tingle get free to really dig a grave for holmes. she was manipulative, selfish and conniving. she even slept with the classmate guy despite her best friend's overwhelming interest in him...and she didn't like him. from attempting to ruin her challengers grades by seizing mrs. tingle's grade book to taking her best friend's man, you would think that holmes would get what she deserves in the end, right? unfortunately, she obtains everything her heart desires, showing that being wicked, manipulative, selfish and whining can get you what you want.mrs. tingle was suppose to be the character you didn't like. they didn't bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be "taught this lesson." she was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation. personally, i felt that her opinions about young people were validated with holmes and her friend's actions every time. i kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail holmes. they kept her tied up in bed, ate up her food like a bunch of pigs, drank up the woman's wine, messed with her personal belongings and we're suppose to believe that she didn't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads? and the classmate guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film. forget idiot, we need a new word for him that isn't in the webster's dictionary. he brought the major trouble into holme's life then made things worse when he came into mrs.tingle's house, uninvited behind holmes, and corners mrs. tingle with a bow and arrow. i was thrilled every time mrs. tingle had a chance to slap fire out of him, or choke the wannabe actress best friend.if you're a teen out there and want to see when a teen's manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her the world, see this unfunny, caricature filled, unintentional film noir.

i heard this movie was badthey even warned me it was terrible, but for some reason (probably katie holmes) i still watched it when it came on national tv. watching kevin williamson films means torturing! his scenarios aren't funny, definitely not scary and not the least bit creative. teaching mrs. tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series `dawson's creek' and it's probably meant for the same target group as well. before the credits even started, 5 people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie `i love you'-sentence. it doesn't get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop/rock and the storyline is ultra-thin. three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the wickedest teacher in school. every high-school has a teacher like that, you know to save their skin, they try to convince mrs. tingle that it wasn't their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong. the typical high-school humor is completely lost on me, the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting (with the exception of helen mirren) is abominable. i'm sure katie holmes can act  that's a fact proven by her role in `the gift'  but she urgently needs to stop accepting frumpish girl roles. as said before, the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen mirren as the shrew. it's like kathleen turner in `serial mom'! the role suits her perfectly and you can't imagine anyone else playing her. other than that, this is avoidable teenage nonsense.

history teacher mrs tingle seems to have it in for student leigh ann watson, who has her heart on achieving a writing school scholarship. she receives another low grade from tingle, which doesn't help. when one of her classmates luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag, mrs. tingle finds it sticking out. she threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it, but he's not available. so before she reports it the next morning. leigh, her friend jo lynn and scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal. however due to tingle's stubbornness, that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out.wasn't fan of it when i first saw it, and after another viewing, i'm still not one. writer kevin williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films; 'scream (1996)', 'i know what you did last summer (1997)', 'scream 2 (1997)' and 'the faculty (1998)'. he was riding the success (also not to forget the tv show 'dawson's creek), but this project would be the final bump. the difference there, compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay, he was also making his debut in directing. the strange thing though, was that i found his direction to be competently done, but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired. it seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller, without making it gel. the script is cluttered with quick-wit, on-going gags, trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films, but the problem is that it's too watered-down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow. the fractured script had to be more strong and potent, since it's a small-scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets. it tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are there to only serve the story's poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness. the film's ending takes the cake. williamson's polished direction is sound, but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on. you eventually feel it after the halfway mark, and it shows up how minor the story is. the performances are tolerable enough, although if it weren't for helen mirren's classy, icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as mrs. tingle and a buoyant marisa coughlan, we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody-to-shoes katie holmes. barry watson is modest in his slacker part and molly ringwald has a lesser role. the soundtrack packs enough energy, but i found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices.watchable, but mechanical all round.

sorry for any spoilers that this contains. but if you want to read on anyway: i really wonder why so many people are so high on kevin williamson. let's just take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter, shall we? there's scream 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next one), which i think are pretty funny but very overrated. besides, by making scream into a franchise, it ceased to become a parody of horror movies and simply became another one. then there's i know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie again. he co-wrote halloween: h20, but even he had the sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity. then comes the faculty, which i can only say was god-awful. (lots of fun to make fun of, though). don't even get me started on the ridiculous, soap-operatic dawson's creek, i could rail about how bad that is for hours. so then we get to teaching mrs. tingle. first of all, there are tons of little implausibilities in this one. for example: in most high schools that i know of, the valedictorian is not the only one who gets to go to college! this idea that katie holmes's character would never go anywhere unless she was valedictorian was absurd. haven't you ever heard of financial assistance, damn it!? also, i don't think you get expelled from high school or don't get into college because of cheating on one test. there are a bunch of other ones, but i'll skip to the big one now. the ending really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch. great. do you know how many of my teachers i could kidnap based on that logic? i'm sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story, either. that sure wouldn't be necessary. helen mirren was good, she added some nice flair to a character who (as a previous commenter noted) had no reason for anything she did. and has anyone else noticed that katie holmes absolutely can't act? her self-righteousness became incredibly annoying. "you wanted me to fail. blah blah blah." her last two scenes with mrs. tingle were the worst. the only reason i don't regret losing $8.25 on this disaster is because she got beaten up a bit. no, wait, i do regret losing the money: it wasn't real, and she survived. mr. williamson, if you're reading this, you've made the same movie (some violence and/or scary stuff offset by wise-ass kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) just a few too many times now (i count 6 so for, not including scream 3 and whatever follows it), and i would really appreciate it if you would stop. otherwise, i might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. ok? :-)

this isn't a dreadful film, merely insipid. the plot is deeply flawed and implausible. it tries to be a number of genres and fails at each. it fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. it almost succeeds as science fiction. the direction is uninspired and katie holmes, cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting. the only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is helen mirren. her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it. her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range. other than marissa coughlin's delightful exorcist rendition, mirren is the only reason to see this movie. a solid 3.0.

mr. moto's gamble has a fairly straight forward plot - when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it's up to the even more mysterious mr. moto to solve the case.i'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr. moto's gamble on imdb. because to me...well, i found it extremely disappointing. i enjoy mr. moto and i enjoy charlie chan, but i can't say i cared for this mish-mash of the two. for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr. moto's gamble, it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film. but when warner oland backed-out, some of the scenes and action were rewritten for peter lorre and mr. moto. as i indicated, the end result left me underwhelmed. mr. moto is not chan. he's more mysterious, he's more athletic, and he's more exotic. so trying to put moto in a chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole - it doesn't work. and listening to lorre/moto try to deliver one of chan's trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly. add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes (something that i never seem to enjoy) and you end up with a movie that i couldn't help but dislike. if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of keye luke. but even he's not near enough to save mr. moto's gamble in my eyes.sorry, but a 4/10 is about the best i can give this one.

having spent the six years previous writing and producing, luc besson returns to the directors chair with angel-a. i'm a huge fan of léon, and quite liked the prospect of a black and white french film from the same chap.andré is a liar and gambling addict, owing money to almost every loan shark in paris. unable to repay his debts, and fed up with being held over the edge of the eiffel tower, he decides to kill himself. he happens to do so at the same time as a mysterious woman, who he decides to save. determined to thank him, she begins to help him fix his own life.the film starts with some laughs, which run well throughout. the visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of paris. but that is it. that's all the film has got going for it. and these mere two facets can do nothing to hold back the torrent of terrible film-making the movie unleashes. though i can't hugely fault the main character (his inconsistencies are close though), the eponymous one is ghastly. a terrible screen presence and bitterly annoying. the plot is ridiculously inconsistent itself, and at times bizarrely silly, particularly the ending; an ending which completely bloodied the fledgling redemption engendered by the scenes immediately prior to it. perhaps the most ridiculous scene i've had the ignominy of observing, it is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic, and considerably too awful to be "so bad it's funny". the overall premise of the film could conceivably have once held potential, but it is brutally massacred by the unendingly terrible implementation of its ideas. the film really was a task to watch, and one which had me screaming at the screen the whole way through.massively and immeasurably flawed, angel-a is just plain bad. though its occasionally fun dialogue manages to draw out chortles at rare intervals, by the end it is clear that this film is nothing more than repugnant.

angel-a is a change of pace for besson; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre. it is well photographed on location in paris, although subtitle-readers should note: quick-fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing.this film is no "wings of desire" or "wonderful life". despite its shared themes (heavenly intervention averts suicide, angel/mortal relationships ensue), besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. even the well acted, teary moments, rapidly descend into toe-curling sentimentality.the film's flawed ideology irritates; an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour; a "happy ending" which negates the hero's supposed journey from helplessness to self-esteem and independence.verdict: quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine. 4/10

this is a really obnoxious show. it is in fact an example of how low television has fallen since 'reality' got in style. tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rude and has awful taste. is a house show the place for sex appeal? apparently some males like the show because they find tanya attractive. the other boss is not pretty but he's fully as rude and also has awful taste. it is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone is still living in them. most of the people who are allegedly viewing these houses before changes are made should be moving into brand new houses or completely empty ones so they will not be insulting anyone. most of them ..like the 'crew'..need to be taught manners. i can imagine how awful the british show is since the british reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste.what happened to the arts and entertainment channel? when it started out (and for some years afterward) it was filled with treats. now it's one big trash machine.

clossius says that "baltic storm" is banned in sweden. that is not correct! instead you can buy the film almost everywhere, like in gas stations, shopping malls, internet (of course) and so on. often to a very low price because this movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks to keep up the interest. the movie only appeals to conspiracy theorists, psychos and other persons living in la-la-land and those who "knows the truth". working on a museum with the estonia disaster as a theme i have meet them all! i have heard about every theory that exists like cocaine-smuggling, weapon-smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, the russian- the american- the estonian- the swedish- and the finnish intelligence, often in different combinations.some normal persons have asked why we don't show the film? a question only asked by them who haven't seen this terrible nonsense movie. once again, "baltic storm" is not banned in sweden. it has some entertaining qualities but what a hell is donald sutherland doing in this movie?

i have to admit, i picked this movie just for the cast, and while sutherland, scacchi, and prochnow were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the movie was such a let down. it feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts, that is, scripts lacking any depth, awful photography and editing, and hilariously lousy score! i can't believe i was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end... the sad thing is, this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. all the potential was there to make it a hit; that is, two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies, and a great core cast (even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality). but maybe i'm missing something; until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.

controversial german journalist jutta rabe who herself got divers to the estonia wreck, put this silly "thriller" together to save her investment.donald sutherland is of course always watchable - but he's only in three scenes. he delivers his material perfectly - as you can ask from a professional. also, the main lead, jürgen prochnov, is at times very good.the rest of the cast is, however, bad. the actress that plays the swedish minister secretary (or whatever she was - she seems not listed in the cast) is extremely bad.the script has some nice ideas, and the story is actually kind of interesting. the final screenplay should have been re-written a couple of more times though. some scenes are plain ridiculous - especially the end scenes.the film is almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes too long. presented as a 60 minutes tv-film, this could have been really interesting. as a two hour feature, it's pretentious, boring, stupid and plain out silly.jutta rabe might be a good journalist (her ideas about governments using estonia to transport military items from estonia to sweden have been concluded as true recently, when the swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship estonia for this), but as a film producer she sucks.the director, the writer and the actors suck more.i give this film 3/10. i would've given it a 1, if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times, donald sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage.but we don't even see the boat sink! what kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that? like a werewolf movie without werewolves...

i admire the effort of trying to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story. however, the movie is done so badly that most people i know couldn't sit through it. the movie was relevant to me since i lived in estonia when these events took place, but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter. the music choices do not flow well with the movie, it seems as if someone just turned a cd player on in the background to put the actors "in the mood". the acting... well, what acting? the only people acting are jürgen prochnow and donald sutherland, even though prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. as far as the relationship development goes between erik westermark (jürgen prochnow) and julia reuter (greta scacchi), it is like watching a train wreck. there is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their "sincere moments." this is not a good movie. there is a difference between trying to get a message out (could've been a documentary!) and trying to make a good movie. this is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. as a matter of fact, as a native of estonia i am offended by this miserable effort. this tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low-budget ghost chase excuse of a movie. this could have been much more!

this music is totally out of touch with the film, showing up now and then as wagnerian bombast and lone ranger hurry-up, otherwise nonexistent. the acting, outside of the two principals, is nonexistent. it would have been an excellent student film. the russian soldiers are just models trying to act. the constant interruptions with wow-explosive-camera angles and monocolor clips of pieces of people were quite irritating, but that's just a personal feeling. the story line isn't worse than others, actually not worse than most, completely ignoring logic and reason and reality. at least nobody walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit. the three top-level bad guys were campy.

much like tinto brass ("caligula"), the people who made this movie can't tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism. no build-up at all, just throw naked women on the screen; no, it doesn't work that way. if close-ups of female genitalia aren't your thing, prepare to be looking away from the screen at many points (i often did). the "all women are whores at heart" mentality of the movie is offensive, and the "story" is by turns absurd and boring (the escape is the most boring part!). but halfway through there is a random scene that pops out of nowhere and involves one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) guards in a nude wrestling match, which she wins with a couple of judo moves. although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. in fact, that scene and the nice cinematography are the only two reasons i give this film * out of 4, instead of 0.

i've come to realise through watching this sort of film that i don't like them very much. caged women is yet another 'women in prison' film, and like the most of the rest of the genre; the plot is completely forsaken in favour of simply showing nude women. now don't get me wrong; i love nude women, but i also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity, and since this film has only the basic 'women are in prison' theme running through it (aswell as the essential escape, of course), i got a bit bored before the end. the film is good because there's barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes, but that's about the only positive element. director (and writer, ha ha) erwin c. dietrich delights in showing close-ups of the naked female body, but it's never very erotic. the director was the producer on a number of trash flicks, including some directed by jess franco. in my opinion, he should stick to producing as his writing talents are non-existent, and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene. this sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time, but i reckon franco could have made more out of it. overall, this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff; but i can't say i enjoyed it.

another example of the women-in-prison genre. this is not exactly a genre known for quality films, but this is a notch below most. a bunch of women are taken from the bordellos where they work to a prison on a rocky island. once there, they are subjected to lots of poorly directed sex and atrocious "dialog." for a film with an astounding amount of sex and nudity there is really nothing erotic about any of it. the sex scenes are awkwardly acted, and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to drag on and on. that said, there are at least some minimal production values. on the w-i-p scale i would put it above frauen fur zellenblock neun, but below chained heat.

i'd love to write a little summary of this movie's plot, but...there simply isn't one! if you just take a look at the plot keywords for this title, you pretty much know the entire content of the film: sex, breasts, exploitation, female frontal nudity and women's prison! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more. "escape of the island women" (an alternate title that isn't even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman-in-prison classic, but it totally lacks the brutality of one. wip-flicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex. director erwin dietrich surely can't compete with specialists in the field, like jess franco or joe d'amato, and he should have sticked to making ordinary soft-core flicks. the only aspects that slightly look like cult-cinema are the resemblance of the tyrant-president with fidel castro and the group-rape of a (minor?) girl by soldiers. the girls are ravishing, though, and the ibiza filming location looks very enchanting.

yet another "gay" film ruined by asinine politics. luigi's final speech just about sent me running out of the theatre with its bumper-sticker epigrams. read the comic book it was based on for a much more entertaining experience.

how much can you really say about a condom with teeth? the plot was really out there, but it was something campy to see on a friday night. the story has a lot of unexpected twists, and it's a great way to offend all you're conservative friends!

river queen attempts to pack a complicated, sweeping, historical narrative into just under two hours. there are some breathtaking battle scenes and the wanganui scenery is beautifully captured. however, the film did suffer from some poor leads - samantha morton (sarah) especially came across as unconvincing. there seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif tossed by fate or as a strong, determined character with a clear view of her destiny. kiefer sutherland's character - private doyle - seemed to be pointless and for the most part - unintelligible. keifer's irish brogue needs a little polishing. on the other hand, cliff curtis, temuera morrison and rawiri pene (as sarah's son "boy") were well rounded and believable.the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed. it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up. e.g. how on earth did wiremu know how to find sarah and doyle? no explanation and very unsatisfying.i did go to this movie with an open mind. i hadn't read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production. what i experienced was a mish mash of new zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.

this is the 1990's tv show,not the movie from 1979.it looks to be three episodes totaling just under 90 minutes.before watching,i thought it was one of the movie versions,and i noticed right away,it had a tv show feel to it.i didn't care for it too much.i just felt the story wasn't there,and there wasn't much in the way of excitement or drama.i was looking at the time elapsed on my dvd player frequently,as i was really bored.i also thought some of the dialogue was,to put it politely,not good.plus, i thought the acting left a lot to be desired. but that's just me however,it is good clean,wholesome family entertainment.there's certainly nothing offensive here.kids will likely enjoy it.for me,the black stallion is 4/10

this was a very nice concert by the one and only mj. the choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. the vocals were okay. i have to admit that his vocals were crap on human nature and billie jean. you couldn't hear him half the time. the other songs make up for the singing. the highlights of the show are: jam smooth criminal i just can't stop loving you she's out of my life thriller billie jean (the dancing not the singing) black or white man in the mirror the concert was almost perfect. if it was anybody but mj it would have been a 9. it is a must see. i wish i was born then so i could have gotten a ticket to the best concert of 1992.

the film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of russia. i won't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time (filmed 1928) but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man. we are merely watching an arranged form of pictures, ranging from a one arm man beating a horse, to a toothless soldier in the war. everything in between is awkward, haphazard and quite unnecessary. it would have been possible to invent a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant.in all, one should view this if they are an art student, on hallucinogenic drugs, or a student of pre-tarkovskian cinema.

while i have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the russian revolution, such as potemkin and ten days that shook the world, i did not particularly enjoy this one. this was mostly due to the annoying and "artsy" way that the director chose to shoot the film. while potemkin excelled in its editing style, this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finesse--in some places, the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish. plus, and this was truly annoying, the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over-the-top. what i mean by "zombies" is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the ukranian peasants were, the people stand like mannequins in many scenes. and, they stand like this, unmoving, for a very long period of time, while the "evil" capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk by. gimme a break! this movie is a wonderful example of style over substance--and it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction.by the way, the dvd for this film is improved, somewhat, if you leave the audio commentary on. this makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights.

i was prepared for a bad movie, and a bad movie it is, so i guess i shouldn't complain. twentysomething tom (gay poster boy robert stadlober) has so many issues he doesn't know if he's coming or going. i wouldn't have stayed but for the pretty girls: serious mavie (anna brüggemann); no-nonsense angie (emma daubas); sarah baumann as the star of the movie within the movie. and then there's tom's soul mate, wild-eyed margarete (jana pallaske). she reminds me of béatrice dalle and gina gershon. if you've got to remember, these are fine memories. she looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and i mean ridiculous, even by berlin standards. i wonder whether i'd have liked this movie when i was the characters' age. my guess is i wouldn't. watch out for indie idols oli schulz and max schröder of "der hund marie" performing as street musicians, feeling no pain.

when i first read about "berlin am meer" i didn't expect much. but i thought with the right people, the right locations, the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler failed, it's so ridiculously unauthentic. it's a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlin's so called scene. of course it's not all about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie that's being sold as "the definite berlin movie".and apart from all the credibility stuff, it really is a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented. so it really must be poor directing skills.don't bother watching "berlin am meer" unless you are 17, come from some small town in western germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school. then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool.

when i first heared that there was going to be the world is not enough video game for the nintendo 64, i was so excited. when it finally came out, i was one of the first ones to rent it. i rented it for 7 days, and i got through the whole game!!! the game was to easy and gave out too much hints. a majour dissapointing sequel to goldeneye. take my advice and do not rent this game.sure the guns and gadgets are cool, but one gets tired of a watch lazer that looks like it was taken right from goldeneye with the exception of being a red color instead of a blue color, a poor excuse for a dart gun, horrible stunner and a stupid grapple hook that can only attach itself to things that are yellow and black.i think that rare should of made this game instead of ea who should stick to games there good at making, like sport games and should stear clear of first person shooters and let the masters do the work.

man this thing bites! i am sorry i ever sat down and watched it! friedkin was insane for making a film attempting to win over the viewers sympathy for this lunatic if it were up to me i'd have made the audience hate that low life instead of getting all misty eyed over him! he killed people! quite grizzly i might add too! and friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he's "not right"! i say friedkin can forget it! i hate the guy this movie is partly based on and hope they did wise up and give his sorry butt the juice!!! in a nut shell, don't waste your time! it's sick and perverse!

from the brilliant mind that brought us "the exorcist"...and "cruising." "rampage" is unfortunately more like the latter. it's an overall messy movie that has a major made-for-tv vibe going for it. the whole film pretends to hinge on the question, "what if the 'boy next door' was a serial killer?" but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the the insanity plea and death penalty that makes little sense. the movie is very loosely based on the richard trenton chase case, culling a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome. one of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow analagous. "sometimes you just have to choose," says the lead character. yeah, sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug...on your tv!

every once in awhile i'll remember that i've actually seen this bizarre fiasco that's a cross between "whatever happened to baby jane?", "sunset boulevard," the lana turner lsd movie "the big cube" and the manson murders, which also took place in 1969 but maybe before this so-called "movie" was made! there are some descriptions of the plot already here, so i won't go into it. but it's worth noting that miriam hopkins plays a parody of herself: a chattering, ego-maniacal, fading actress. perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the bette davis horrors. the old gal hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it to her. she shows a little too much flesh in this movie, something davis and crawford would never have done. and there's a scene with miriam in the actual tacky hollywood boulevard christmas parade, which must have been filmed xmas, 1968.gale sondergard is old, old, old. it's just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks. john garfield, jr. looks a bit like his father, but not as interesting. i think one of the three stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. if it's not one of the stooges, it's somebody.i was astounded to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this. it's amazing!!!

when i typed savage intruder into the imdb's search engine one of the options it came up with was savage garden: international video collection: the story so far (1999), the only reason i mention this is because i'm a huge savage garden fan & you should do yourself a favour & check some of their music out like affirmation or to the moon and back rather than bother with this average pot-boiler, sorry i just wanted to say that. anyway, savage intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like mgm musical & premiere footage & a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run. it's late 60's hollywood & amid the glitz & glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses, killing them & dismembering their bodies. a young man named vic valance (david garfield as john david garfield) hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress, katharine parker (miriam hopkins) who was 'one of the biggest stars of the motion picture' but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named mildred (florence lake), a personal secretary leslie blair (gale sondergaard) & a young maid named geta (virginia wing). katharine has recently broken her foot & needs a personal assistant & gives vic the job. slowly vic charms his way into katharine's affections & more importantly her large wallet. vic starts to turn katharine against the other employees, but vic isn't what he seems. vic is a drug addicted loon who gets greta pregnant while still having sex with katharine. greta threatens to tell katharine & spoil vic's devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe, no one in the house is safe as vic brings drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll party's & gardening to the parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more & more apparent...written, produced & directed by donald wolfe i thought savage intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time. the script is all over the place & it can't really decide what it wants to be, savage intruder suffers from an identity crisis! the film starts with the discovery of a severed head & limbs, straight after another woman (dorothy kingston) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them. savage intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as vic befriends katharine & shows her how to enjoy life again & having an implied sexual relationship with her, it's actually disgusting to think about as she's old enough to be his grandmother. katharine stops living the life of a recluse & gives up the alcohol as vic appears to make her happy as they go to party's together & hold banquets for katharine's friend like she used too. this part of savage intruder wouldn't look out of place in a disney film! every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by vic shooting up & having silly hallucinations about his mother (sybelle guardino) & chopping her hand off with an axe, he has sex with great at one point as well. then, after greta has been murdered, savage intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as vic is revealed for the loony that he is. savage intruder just doesn't flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success. similarly the murder mystery elements don't work & are frankly a bit of a puzzle, why go to great lengths to conceal the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway? vic as a character didn't work for me either, one moment he's a cool, calm, clever & devious con man & then next he's a stark raving loony! why kill all his other victims but with katharine try to con her? what makes her so different? if it is because she has money why not go after her to start with? so many questions & so few answers... some of the 60's dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when vic offers greta a painkiller, in reality hard drugs, & greta says "what do i need a painkiller for?", vic helpfully replies "because your a pain" wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies! or when katharine suggests that vic do some gardening & ask's "do you have green fingers?" he replies "no, but i'm good at grass!" there isn't much gore in savage intruder, some severed limbs & a couple of decapitated heads. there is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why it's repeated three or four times. the silly looking drug hallucination scenes need to be seen to be believed. technically savage intruder is ok, the location filming in the grandiose mansion & hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves, the acting is average as is the rest of the production. overall i'd say savage intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away & as a result just doesn't work. it's a mildly entertaining one-time-watch at best & a complete mess of a film at worse, you decide which!

that welles said was that he's been in decline his whole career.there was an interesting story here. unfortunately, welles seemed completely incapable of telling it. instead, he was trying to tell a bunch of different stories, about elmyr, about clifford irving, about his pompous view of critics and experts, oh, yeah, and trying to jump start his current girlfriend's career by giving her unneeded screen time. (oja, honey, when they told you to sleep with the director, they didn't mean one washed up like a whale on a beach!) welles was probably trying to cash in with a bunch of footage of clifford irving as irving was becoming a household name with his role in the faked auto-biography of howard hughes. unfortunately, it means the subject of his film, elmyr, didn't get the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting story.the great tragedy of orson welles was that he peaked early, and then spent the rest of his career sputtering, finally doing wine commercials and awful documentaries...

orson welles' 1974 documentary "f for fake" examines trickery and fraud, mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as frauds themselves. clifford irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent howard hughes autobiography, yet, at least it seems, purports his innocence. the other main subject of the film is artist elmyr de hory, a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces, sometimes selling them to museums as real works by the original artists. interspersed among these stories are bits where welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied on his resume and then created a radio sensation with "war of the worlds".i really wanted to love this film and find it profound since i am such a welles devotee, but i couldn't bring myself to do it. part of the problem lied with the fact that it was not just non-linear, it was completely scattered. while i appreciate stylish editing and quick jumps and zooms, particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary, there was simply too much of it going on in "f for fake". they created a distraction as opposed to lending style. if the story had been more clear and comprehensive, i think that the editing probably would not have been as annoying. the scattered storytelling was made all the more obnoxious by the fact that these were truly interesting subjects, particularly elmyr de hory. his artistic fakery brings up the topic of fraud in the art world, and who is truly able to determine the authenticity of certain works; and if the works are not authentic, what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums? this is one documentary that i would say to at least give a shot, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you're not enjoying it. it is certainly the most discombobulated documentary i have ever seen; it is a cross between a documentary, an art film and experimental film, none of which is properly represented or isolated. i don't have any lesser opinion of welles after seeing it, but it certainly, in my opinion, doesn't stand out as a glowing specimen in his oeuvre. 4/10 --shelly

there was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn't been done better in a hundred other films. it was barely worth the trouble of watching through to the end. even the bad language sounded tired. tom mccamus, a very fine actor, was particularly disappointing here.

this movie is exactly the same as ridley scott's, "someone to watch over me", which is a classic. it stars tom berenger and mimi rogers and the bad guy from the fugitive. it's a quality movie, with good direction and great acting. this movie is the polar opposite. it's the same plot, just minus any good acting and adding tv movie direction. i do have to say i like the interaction between lowe and the woman. she's hot and their romance is believable on many levels. unfortunately, that alone cannot save this carbon copy of the classic ridley scott film.usually crappy tv movies have some redeeming quality that makes them watchable at the very least. i think for me, this film's redeeming value is that rob lowe and the lead female have chemistry. that and i was able to watch and compare the plot to another quality film.

looking all of 29 years old, rob lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation.when the husband of a society woman (leslie hope) is found dead, police suspect the rich chick might have something to do with it. enter rob who immediately falls for the pretty widow even though he claims that he's just trying to be 'helpful'. rob is such a good cop, he is able to sneak some of her incriminating love letters into his coat pocket before he accidentally throws them into the fireplace. monotonous murky drama with an endless drone of background music.this is a good substitute sleeping remedy if you've run out of sominex.

what can you say about a film that makes "the erotic witch project" look like "the english patient." again, the plot and characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "tewp."four buxom sorority sisters and a goofy male guide enter a forest to look for the bare wench, and the women become sexually charged. the bare wench leaves porno devices and a blow up doll, just like in "tewp." they get lost, the doofus gets lost, and the girls find their way back to their hotel. there they reenact the end of "the blair witch project," as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, a game integral to the thin plot.at least three of the sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks, along with the rather obvious surgery scars. the one "natural" gal here is humiliated by the director. in a very unfunny, and overlong, end credit segment, outtake scenes where she could not get a line right is played over and over again ad nauseum.julie strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare wench. this one scene seems to be added later, since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it. in the background, as the women cavort and stroke, you can see someone's picket fence. this may be director jim wynorski's backyard.this is just bad stuff. the lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees cooler than "the erotic witch project''s. most of the lovin' consists of the four women mashing their eight collective breasts together. i think they are trying to form a silicone based lifeform that would rescue them from this bad career decision. no such luck. if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the makers of "the blair witch project" should be really really mad.this is unrated, and contains mild physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content, and sexual references.

bare wench is another softcore parody of the blair witch project (i think there's about two dozen of those things out there). it has 5 very attractive women (which includes nikki fritz, julie smith, and julie strain), and one dorky guy whose only purpose is to provide comic relief.okay, so i'm thinking "cool. great looking women, having softcore lesbian sex with each other very 10 minutes or so. this should be real good."unfortunately, the producers blew it. there is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene. there's a couple of false starts, but the majority of the action is just the women posing for the camera. i guess once the producers had spent their money on the women, and spent more getting them to remove their clothes, they didn't have any money left to get them to actually do anything. and i guess they also used up all their alloted nudity time too early, because towards the end of the video, there is a huge amount of pointless dialogue that is obviously being used for no other reason than to pad out the run time. "you're a liar! no you are! you go into the cave! no you go! i think we should go home! well, i don't!" this goes on and on and on forever.there's way better stuff than this.

after watching this movie, i felt as if i had just eaten a box of stale, chewy cracker jack only to find no prize inside. this movie has real promise: porn stars in a skinemax feature! unfortunately, someone forgot to tell the producers that we like some t&a in our t & a flicks!!! sure, we get a few quick flashes and a couple of "bathing in the creek" scenes. but where's the sex? how can you have four girls, "sorority girls" no less, in this type of movie with only one, pitiful 5 second lesbian scene? good night, usa up all night provides more titillation! look, we don't watch this type of movie for great cinematography, screenwriting or action. we want to see some kink! what a letdown.

wynorski films are always excreble. this is just another case in point. out of the five naked women shamelessly flaunted here, maybe one has real breasts. and that's a strong maybe. no humor, no gore, just boobies, boobies, boobies. and some tepid softcore lesbo action. but know what? for fifty cents less than this video rental, i could have rented legitimate porn. do i feel cheated? with wynorski, always. so i prepared myself for a letdown, as one must always do.

well, this may be one of the worst movies ever, but atleast there are some nice t*ts in it. the movie is a very bad spoof of the blair witch project, and should be watched only by those wanting to see some t*ts, and no point other than to flaunt them.

i give "flashdance" a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos, in order to clock in as a feature length film. since when does that count as film? jennifer beals plays alex owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer, who, incomprehensibly, has a job as a welder in a pittsburgh steel factory. not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. meanwhile, at night she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called mawby's. yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at mawby's, you would think they were working at the best casino on the las vegas strip.alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss, nick hurley (michael nouri), who is about twice her age. after resisting nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. alex and nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to alex's co-workers.when beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious pittsburgh conservatory of dance. inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. she angrily tells nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. this is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.of course, alex does eventually get her audition at the conservatory. she puts on a dance routine before the conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the mtv generation. oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the mtv generation.i don't think i can judge whether or not beals can actually act well on the basis of what i saw in "flashdance". this is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that i don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.you have to hand it to the makers of "flashdance" though. this movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. in this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on mtv. if they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that i cared about. instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. a truly forgettable "film".

if it wasn't for the terrific music, i would not hesitate to give this cinematic underachievement 2/10. but the music actually makes me like certain passages, and so i give it 5/10.

this movie was jerry bruckheimer's idea to sell some records . no seriously it was . the thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a lp , sell it and make even more money for the studio . you could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when mtv play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie . this is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about hollywood movies from the 1980s and i rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for american film making and flashdance opened the door to this " let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie " type film makingjennifer beals plays alex owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice . welding is a fairly sophisticated trade , it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes . there's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and " flashdancing " being somehow similar . ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot , dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job . it's kind of like saying that screen writing , novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not but i guess none of this mattered to jerry when he asked director adrian lyne to make the movie . actually lyne almost makes a very sexy movie , jenniferbeals is very sweet and innocent looking . fortunately i sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body . that's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man ! i bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that

i'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. how sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. i had major problems with jennifer beals and her character. i found alex extremely repellent. beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. she also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. it is very difficult to believe that nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. and what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. in fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. yuck. as for the dancing, i'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. what on earth was that tv dance sequence about in the club? who was supposed to be dancing? i wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! and even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. the camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. and what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? and as many other comments have pointed out, she would never get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. of the 'flashdancers', i actually thought the best sequence belonged to cynthia rhodes (penny in dirty dancing). you could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. this is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. there were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. the other good scene was the break dancing in the street. i also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.some other random points - who was hanna and how did alex get to know her? what was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? how did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?where were her family? was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? the person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a disney film needs their head examined. and anyway, what happened to the ice skater? many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true. watch "the little mermaid" instead.

when i first watched this movie, in the 80s, i loved it. i was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything. however, i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd, and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was. i mean, in a realistic world, she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory... the whole thing was quite pathetic. the character developments also lacked in depth. i think that this was, very much, a product of the 80s: the film does not hold up today!

flashdance is one of those awful, stupid movies that you actually kind-of enjoy, just because they're so crap. i just watched it on tv & my friend and i were amazed at how dopey it was. it's true that don simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap, lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of (admitedly catchy) pop, so flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer: the first mtv movie. adrian lyne started out in advertising and it shows because flashdance is almost a commercial for itself. you've already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird, panicky undercurrent, as though it's frightened that you might change your mind at any moment. it keeps selling itself to you over and over, all the way through, using slick commercial-style editing and glossy close-ups of jiggling breasts. the story is wafer thin (i honestly can't think of another film i've seen with less plot) and it never makes much sense, but its a very contrived, calculating movie, so it feels consistent. people say it's dated but flashdance was always rubbish. viewers in the early 80's knew it was just cheesy t&a but it does work in its own silly fashion. there's soppy romance for the chick-flick crowd and stacks of oily, writhing female bodies for their dates, all set to a pumping disco beat. how could it fail? it helps that the dialogue is pointless, so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and, if this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the 'interpretive dance' on display. the scene where a stand-in for jennifer beals convulses/'dances' on stage in front of a tv with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make-up had us in stitches. a genuine guilty pleasure.

i was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and i had never actually seen it until last night. i finally decided to watch it because i like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact. after seeing the movie i am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep.the story is pretty preposterous when you think about it. does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel-workers and teamsters could keep their clientèle with the high concept dances that those girls were doing? they would have all been over to zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art". can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre tv watching no theater dance thing that she did? please.it seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer--after all both are physically demanding jobs. but i didn't buy for a second that that girl worked in a steel yard. and i didn't buy for a second that i was looking at a real steel yard. steel work is dangerous. you don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb. i love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding. what the hell are they doing in there? or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. she was obviously board and just started cutting random things up.but story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way. flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it, however.the dancing horrible. it is the spastic twitch-and-pose style that ruined american musicals until...well are we really over it yet? the sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by jennifer beal's complete lack of personality. i mean i am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib.you can't really get behind alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. the dog had more going on than she did.the love affair is flat. it comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers. zero passion.even the final scene where she dances for orville redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable. what serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at alex's lame cheerleader routine? in short the movie had nothing but leg-warmers and large sweatshirts. oh, yeah, there is a good chunk of nudity when alex "rescues" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a laughable bit of hypocrisy). other than that the movie is a waste of time. i wish that the mst3k crew were still in business. this would make good fodder for them.

bad acting , combats are very awful , 3-4 second between each text , bad music , bad effect and always the same plan during the movie. if you want laugh go it 2/10 ( for the fool laugh)

enchanted april was one of harry beaumont's last movies- he only directed a few more after this one. he had made the "maisie" movies in the 1930s and 1940s. in the opening credits, it says "from the novel by elizabeth", and completely leaves off the author's last name... rather odd, but since it was von armin, they may not have wanted the german association at the time... sad to hear it was a flop when it was released, with those fun names like frank morgan (the wizard) and jessie ralph, who played w.c. fields' disapproving mother- in- law in "bank dick". two gals in london (ann harding & katharine alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things don't go the way they planned. reginald owen plays the husband with multiple personalities. aside from a few funny moments, it does move pretty slow. ralph is the only bright spot here, as the overbearing take-charge type, and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film. the views of italy are all obvious backdrops. the only saving grace here is that the turner classic version is only 66 minutes long. too bad they didn't give frank morgan a larger role. this was remade in 1992 by the bbc as a british film.

i had been delighted to find that tcm was showing this, as i love the 1992 version with josie lawrence, jim broadbent, joan plowright...this film had a luminous ann harding, a wonderful performance by frank morgan, but others' acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film. reginald owen's arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife adores him. i found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book. the original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete. too bad it was such a let-down.

the final installment in the karate kid series is predictable, poorly acted, and so bad it borders on the enjoyable. but not quite, it's just bad. in this installment ralph macchio's karate kid is absent, already having been in one too many of the episodes. the new kid, played by hillary swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of mr. miyogi's wwii buddies. her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion. in steps mr. miyogi to set things right. true to formula, there is a group of neo-fascist bullies, called the alpha troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move, called the praying mantis. as i said before this movie is a mess, and should be avoided.

in 1984, the karate kid had some charm to it, even if it was little more than a poor man's rocky. alas, producer jerry weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended, and convinced ralph macchio and pat morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. part iii was the definitive low in the franchise, yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. what other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of the next karate kid?wait a minute. next? yep, macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually), and his replacement is hilary swank (!), playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named julie pierce. now, the girl has family issues. she also gets in trouble at school. said school has a sadistic gym teacher (michael ironside). as it turns out, though, one of his students is actually a nice guy, and julie falls for him. this gets her in bigger trouble than before, of course. lucky for her, she is currently living with mr. miyagi (morita), an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys.all those factors ad up to seven clichés, and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! from beginning to end, the next karate kid is a tired, flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. swank does, thankfully, have the likes of boys don't cry and million dollar baby to redeem this disaster, but why did morita accept to come back? he may have received an oscar nomination for the first movie, and was quite enjoyable in the sequels, but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the "wax on, wax off" gag is stillborn. as for ironside, he is slightly better than martin kove and thomas ian griffith in part iii, but that's hardly a stretch.so, is this picture really that awful? not exactly. there is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty, but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives, it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.

they missed up the film when the tried to use some one diffrent. they should of keeped ralph macchio as danny instead of changing it. and made more karate kids with him in it.and also many people were woundering what happen to danny when they jumped from 3 to 5 and no four.

this film is so bad. i mean, who commissions this stuff? and the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983. a bloke puts a female wig on and fights....nuff said.

i am truly sad that this is the first bad review i've ever made for a movie...ever.i could stand to watch this movie, and it is the second movie in all the movies i've seen that is just...a downgrade. the first is open water, that just had no point whatsoever. the next karate kid didn't have any mention of daniel(correct me if i'm wrong, please.),and that ending line came as a shock. it was like, "if must fight...win." then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing, and i was like, oh. okay, so it'll take a while for this next part. and then the credits hit the screen.geez man!! hopefully, i will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again, i apologize for those of you who like the next karate kid, i really, really do...

i can accept the fact this was the next karate kid so ralph macchio can be happily retired from the series, and while hillary swank is great for the role....the plot to the movie is just dreadful.mr. miyagi's old buddy from world war 2 dies, leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand-daughter when her parents die in an accident. the girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local rotc...which i'll explain in a minute, has it out to get her. you know the drill...miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.its hokey, its cheesy, its the 90's....but that's not even the long and the short of it. my first case of "huh?" is why is there a "military division" in high school? i thought that stuff went out in the 1960's, especially in a public school. as much as michael ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel, since when is military involved in a high school? my next gripe is that during the prom scene, the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of people....why? the thing i noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through (billy in part 1, sato in part 2, kreese in part 3). this movie is no different. after ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom, blow up eric's car and threaten hillary swank the whole movie.....ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like "um...no" if you're gonna do pathetic face turns, at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod.as for the rest of the love plot between eric and hillary swank....corny but nothing to melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage ralph macchio pulled in the first 3 movies.i will say for its own movie, after watching the first 3 movies, i can accept it being more or less a spin off...but i can't accept the whole military thing, way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously. now if ironside and crew was a wrestling/football team and he was the coach, that would have been more believable.ironside and morita deliver the goods, swank is ok...the rest are the same as anything, the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, that was cool 4 out of 10

hillary swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film. pat morita, desperate for work, any kind of work, agreed to reprise his role as the "karate teacher" and bring his brand of karate to the silver screen once again, except this time, hillary "skank" swank is the student.i can just see the hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a "tormented, spoiled brat" female take the role from ralph. the film does not work on any level and it's boring on every level. there's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to. the film was made without any thought of making money because it's just so bad.i would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black-listed for their miserable and insulting efforts.

"the next karate kid" is a thoroughly predictable movie, just like its predecessors. its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewer's part, who often wishes the story could move a little faster. despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively because of the presence of morita. he doesn't seem tired of his role, and he does inject some life and humor into the film, becoming the best reason for you to see it. not awful, but nothing much, either.

i had been avoiding this movie for sometime...because i viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts. but, after reading some fairly favorable reviews...from some imdb watchers...i spent $1.50 and rented it at my local video store. need i go further...when i say....this was a buck-50 lost. this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen. first off....i realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old macchio in this film.....but, why could'nt they have had miyagi read a letter or something from daniel-san...maybe explaining what happened to daniel...hell, they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something. but, no...and to compund the already bad script....they added those stupid monks...i thought monks take a vow of silence...guess these yapping monks don't take their vows seriously...hehehe. the training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid...and the paramilitary group of young males....were a confusing concept to say the least....this was far from even being a martial arts movie...with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene....and then she didn't even come close to getting hit even once...by the male fighting her....give me a break...she would have gotten hit at least once....i guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one. i could go on and on...but, basically...i'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad....even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even look at(she was sorta "butch" looking)....i can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit through...that compare to just how bad this flick was.....don"t waste your time on this one..........

i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series. after all, part 3 didn't measure up to part 2, and this one doesn't have daniel sawn. miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.the girl's part was pretty good. she's a lost teenager who needs direction. i find the plot a little hard to believe. that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr. miyagi, a man she just met. of course, he was a friend of her brother.i did appreciate the monastery. one might think from some of my other reviews that i wouldn't have liked the dancing monks, but i thought it was amusing. it showed that they know how to have some fun. now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to pop-music, that would have been another matter.probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid, nations trying to destroy each other is stupid, but having respect for all life is not stupid. miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.i give this movie a 4 out of 10. sure, there were some things i liked about it. it wasn't as funny as part three, and no character could ever live up to sato in part 2. this movie has no re-watch value. i can't imagine watching it again, but it is worth seeing once.

young spinster, who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom...but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night. sandy dennis is not a hapless actress, but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles i guess we'll never know. based on a book by richard miles, and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get, this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman (whose work is static, at best). the narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of "the collector", a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. even the film's best sequence (dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off, with sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs, but he's handled too bashfully by altman, with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here, she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen. as such, the abrupt finale is maddening, and the overall results tepid. *1/2 from ****

the screenplay is the worst part of this film, as it lurches from one premise to the next, missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible. (this film is confusing, because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) i had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasn't great, but this is telly, so it was fine. i don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. but having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? avoid this at all costs.the prologue in particular was so poorly written, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. the prologue was rushed, it wasn't clear what was happening, ie. the russian revolution was reduced to "some riots are happening in petersburg", with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. i know the basic history of the revolution, so i could fill in the details, "those pesky communists". the prologue is best ignored.this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. it sets up this premise in the asylum. it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. no. gone. the film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) it sets up a melodramatic romance, a love so strong, it'll believe anything she says. okay, a soppy romance. no, because it makes no sense. the love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally, sleazy) lunatic, bursting out in wild gestures. this also doesn't work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. they never got married and she returned to america. the love story collapses. despite there being plenty of love scenes, i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. i find rom-com romances more convincing, despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other.it could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is, and she struggles to prove her identity. no, the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. the bizarre voice over comes back, again to fill in the details of a better film.the funniest thing to consider is what really happened. anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together. throughout her life, she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. none of this in the film either. there's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'one flew over the cuckoo's next/'twelve monkeys'-type informant. thankfully, she vanishes, having brought nothing to the story.

the man with bogart's face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40's film era. it fails miserably for several reasons. first, sacchi, while looking reasonably like bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms, completely lacks any of bogart's charisma or acting ability. this is really apparent whenever sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of bogart's films. second, the film does not have the first rate character actors bogart was able to work with. there are no peter lorre's or sydney greenstreet's in this one, folks. sure we are treated to performances by victor buaeno, olivia hussey and george raft amongst others, but they just aren't of the same caliber (or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast). third, the attempts at "modern" humor all fall through. all of the underwear jokes, having marlowe almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though bogart would have), etc. just aren't funny and really pull down this film. fourth, i've never heard a goofier theme song this side of mitchell. finally, the film's false reverence for bogart (and other classic actors work) is truly irritating. bogart almost *never* played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. he played complicated characters. this movie makes bogart out to be a trigger-happy, moralistic do-gooder. while this may have been true about some film characters, bogart's characters rarely fit that bill. it's movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey, "good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl" crap with low production values.

this movie should have been called "the eyes of alexander", and they should have done away with the bogart concept altogether. the film started out with a lighthearted approach to bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller, where two palm size sapphires, purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of alexander the great, for him, and seen by him, right before his death. so the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the greatest conquerer the world has ever known. being an expert on alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction, but it makes for a good movie anyway. so the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which i really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go to a movie in '79-'80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience). there is a yacht named euridice (alexander's father's young wife), a man named alexander, philip, cleitus?, (it's been about 5 years since i've seen the film, so can't remember all the details), olympias, some street names, and many others. it was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an alexanderphile himself) put in. when all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. kind of a neat ending. what would have been more fun would be if they went the indiana jones way and had an action adventure. there were many, many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, or instance, the hand-annotated (by aristotle) version of the iliad that alexander kept with him all his life, even on his many journeys across asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). olivia hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actress)is killed off way too early, and should have been the main actress throughout, not the girl from the momma's and the poppa's...though she was herself easy on the eyes. if you can find this flick, it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see olivia hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on, but beyond that, i'd pass on it for something more entertaining.yours, nick

done in a mock-documentary style, late 60's subversives and supposed detractors of the mainstream government are arrested and given a choice. upon sentencing for their wrong doings,there is a choice of going to prison for 7 years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern california desert at punishment park. in the 100 degree heat, the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an american flag for their freedom. us and state law enforcers will follow two hours latter. if the dissidents are captured it means prison.appearing in this pseudo-documentary: carmen argenziano, katherine quittner, mary ellen kleinhall, stan armsted, scott turner, patrick boland and kent foreman.

committed doom and gloomer peter watkins goes slummin' across the pond to take on the american justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly. watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with cliché freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements. talk about a revolution.in punishment park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across punishment park (death valley) and freedom. of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren't about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed.punishment park has elements of kafka in setting as well as theme. trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of silent majority for a peaceful america) who snarl back. neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look. mostly its just one side saying what's wrong with america the other saying what's right with no one offering solutions for change. meanwhile the punishment park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds. it kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70's college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now.peter watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few. culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century scotland that still resonates. war game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all. punishment park has its value as well but for other than intended reason. watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( vietnam, kent state, the chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth. but 35 years later the fever has subsided and punishment park with it's unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride.

i loved the first 15 minutes, and i loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal--which proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead-of-its-time method acting technique--but this movie ultimately disappoints. even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressor/oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the us government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks punch and believability, and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already.and for the record: despite rampant rumors to the contrary, this movie has never been banned in the us (i can't comment on the rumors of uk censorship, but i'm suspicious). hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing, and i am more than willing to believe the nixon government had some influence on this decision; however, the fact that it never appeared on american television is merely a reflection of this medium's rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business. as for the present, you can have your very own copy of the dvd delivered to your door via amazon in a few days.

the person making taffy in this movie was so realistic. that person must have been trained so well! if i were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy, i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy.

a really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow. the actors are older but none of them looked particularly good. they needed better make up,photography or something.it is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film. i liked the cast but i think the performances were rather bland. this is where the weakness of the director shows. perhaps if mrs. spielberg had mr. spielberg directing it would have been a much better film.

obviously, a number of agents didn't see beyond dollar signs when they signed up their clients for this 117-minute *omage* to the courtesan complex.sure, the film could have been alright, had the $1 million been left out of it. seriously. the amount of the check doesn't matter,prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love conquers all" can change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant to imply "for richer for poorer, for pimping as in fidelity". picture the story otherwise, though: 2 kids, flat broke, borderline "desperate" and completely stupid. they collide with wealthy business man. kids' marriage is strained by imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser. enter mr. tuxedo, oozing charm and stability -- a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock -- and with him the wife's temptation, tensions, suspense. whom will she choose? maybe, under those conditions, i could actually care. as-is, frankly, redford's selfish and manipulative playboy winds up the sympathetic character. a woman who will sell herself is just about what a guy deserves who will pimp out his wife. the indecent proposition makes the husband a total loser, deficient in every positive male characteristic, and makes the wife a cheap strumpet seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman devoid of moral center and self-respect.all the impressive talent (acting, directing, cinematography) wasted on this film -- and it was an impressive amount -- couldn't save it from its splashy-but-too-trashy $1 million pitch line. if i see this turkey at one more bridal shower, i'm going to roast it! (or maybe cross it with titanic and pitch the tape in the ocean!)

i saw this movie just recently, and i said to myself: "this movie is bad!" william shatner is a great actor, but he is no director! it's not just that the acting is bad, it's terrible. and instead of a plot, we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot! what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and mccoy were teaching spock how to sing "row, row, row your boat!"do i have something against william shatner? i do not. but when it comes to being a director, he sucks! this film is not one of the worst movies i have ever seen. but it is the worst of the star trek series! i noticed that after this shatner did not return to direct another film in the series. they apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened! overall, this movie sucks! 2/10

man, this would have been a bad episode of the original series. i can't believe they actually spent money on this one... i caught the second half of this on tv and, having never seen this one before, thought i would watch it... boy, what a waste of time... more cheese than wisconsin!!!

(some spoilers) prc quickie that has j. carrol naish playing dr. igor markoff who's not really dr. karkoff but an impostor who took over his identity back in europe. the real dr. karkoff had a affair with dr.markoff's wife that lead to him to murder the real dr.markoff and then having his wife lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like the "elephant man's" sister. this was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep lenore all to himself; but the disturbed lenore later got even with her insane husband by killing herself. this nut, the fake dr. markoff, then spots patricia lawrence, wanda mckay, one evening at the theater where her father tony lawernce, ralph morgan, a world famous pianist is giving a concert. enchanted by the lovely patricia who's a dead ringer for his dead wife lenore dr. markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her even though she's want's nothing to do with him.after getting ridicules in his efforts to get patricia to fall in love with him, by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to then as much as five times a day,tony goes to see the crazed dr. mankoff to tell him to stop annoying his daughter. it's then that tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him injected with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a somewhat unsightly fellow. with his hands and body swelling up and not being able to play his beloved piano tony is told by his doctor dr. adams,sam flint, that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then dr. markoff! the person who gave it to him. the movie has the usual sub-plots with dr. markoff's assistant maxine,tala birell, who's also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for patricia. there's also dr. markoff's hulking butler glenn strange who, like his pet gorilla, is just a big clumsy oaf who can't even subdue maxine who's less the half the size. strange ends up getting bopped on the head and knocked out cold by patricia's boyfriend bobby blake, terry frost. as for the gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do in maxine and is chased away, and locks himself back up in his cage, by the pet dog ace. dr. markoff in his desperation to get patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting markoff dead with his own gun. there is a happy ending to this whole mess with maxine, who knew as much about markoff's cure for acromegaly as he did, injecting tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new. the movie ends, like it started, with tony playing the piano to a packed and cheering house at the local theater.

dr. markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting , trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. when he attends a piano concert, he is stricken by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and sets out to woo her. but when she wants nothing to do with him, he infects her father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a cure.that is the basic premise for this b-grade low budget thriller. i have to say i was underwhelmed by this movie. not that it was terrible-it wasn't, but there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it either. it was entertaining enough for a viewing but is not one that will stay in my memory.the dialog is a bit corny at times and the acting is just mediocre. the story is fairly predictable and doesn't really give us anything new. of course, i can't complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit who serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a svengali-like stare that fails to mesmerize his victims.it may be worth a watch if you like this sort of movie, but don't go into it with too many expectations.

"a scientist has developed a serum which grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and heads. the scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. j. carrol naish (as dr. igor markoff) plays "the monster maker" in the low budget bela lugosi mode.mr. naish's serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly", which american heritage defines as, "a chronic disease of adults marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities, face, and jaw that is caused by overactivity of the pituitary gland." ralph morgan (as anthony lawrence) plays the afflicted man with some dignity. pretty blonde wanda mckay (as patricia "pat" lawrence) is the daughter desired by mad scientist naish; in early scenes, ms. mckay and naish emote hilariously.watch for tala birell (as maxine) in a surprisingly good supporting performance; she plays the somewhat garbo-like, and long suffering, assistant to naish. ms. birell definitely steals the film; and, you've got to question dr. markoff's sanity in casting her aside. glenn strange (as steve) and a crazed gorilla (ray corrigan) add to the fun. the monster makeup (maurice seiderman) is very good.**** the monster maker (1944) sam newfield ~ j. carrol naish, ralph morgan, tala birell

start with the premise that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a look-alike. throw in your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (isn't this the stuff that leo g. carroll contracted from the spider venom in "tarantula"). throw in the fact that the main character, instead of finding some way to attract the young woman, engages in heavy-handed stalking, until he totally draws attention to himself and has to hatch this insane plot: if he can make the girl's father sick, then help him recover, she will marry him. the problem is that most of the events are random and unpredictable. anyone with half a brain would have seen through things. there's a third party, a woman that the doctor, played by j. carroll naish, has treated with great insensitivity. you know she is going to be a factor. there's also a gorilla kept in a cage who is used occasionally for heaven know's what. oh well. there is so little sense to this who thing that it plays itself out and people get their just desserts.

just plain terrible. nick and michael are way better actors than this. a "c" rated flick at best. the plot was weak and the characters totally undeveloped. even the film and sound quality was terrible. i suppose that these were all young actors at the time and this script just filled a job nitch.

occasionally on talk shows a good topical debate sparks some interesting opinions from the audience, unfortunately there is always some desperately sad person seeking acceptance who will end any interesting debate instantly by getting up and saying the proverbial "everyone should get along and love each other" as they know they are guaranteed to get applause and affirmation, as no one would dare disagree.well they are the same people who marked this film as good, why did they do that? insecurity. anyway that's all i'll say on that matter.the film, it starts of reasonably interestingly so you hope it will build, and if like me you've settled in with a nice couple of glasses of wine and some cheese then you will give it even more of a chance simply because you can't be bothered to move.but then you daydream, you wander, your mind drifts of onto other things, why? because the director did too! he took his foot off the gas, and then he realized 'ooops' so to compensate he accelerates hard, but then he drifts again, and again so do you, the story slows, the plot thins and almost disappears, you even wonder to yourself 'so what happened again?' as you ponder your screen will show nick nolte running around with some supposed purpose, but you will have long since cared as to what he is doing and he will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the background to your day dreaming.michael moriarty who plays john converse has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or indeed his face, somewhat like a ventriloquist, he must have gone to the nicolas cage school of expressionless facial acting, or he was attacked by the phantom botox injector.tuesday weld was to play marge converse, but instead she played mia farrow to perfection.in all there are hundreds of thousands of films to see, so leave this one to one of the last, you see i've just wasted an evening watching it when i could have watched or done something else, learn by my mistake, nights off relaxing are precious so don't waste one watching this boring tale, do anything else, dust off that old game of cluedo, practice gurning for the evening or have an argument with a loved one, trim your nose hair, get rid of unused files on our laptop, it will be time better spent what ever you should choose.

seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe, it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talent-free ladies denise richards and milla jovovich went. it also is a particular grating kind of movie, the kind that think they are smart, funny and original while being poor in every aspect. full blame can go to brian burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. his script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it. the situations develop completely without any inner logic, besides that of a desperate scriptwriter. characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, behave stupid and without any real motivation. nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of mrs. richards. we don't believe her relationship with david krumholtz's character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the one-hour mark is particularly pitiful. why would anyone fall for a egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant b**ch like this in the first place, much less a second time? especially after having supposedly found his..erm...true love? and if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie, than the central couple is. the coupling of krumholtz and jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the richards-one, but it is to no avail. there is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple. worse, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in, whatsoever.overall, a very poor showing. even die-hard rom-com fans might want to pass on this one, as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm.

writer/director brian burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies, and he seems to think that he's discovered the formula for success: plenty of location shots in new york (preferably in the winter), allusions to old hollywood films (especially musicals), enjoyable musical soundtrack. alas, all of this is mere compensation for burns' lack of talent as a writer. (the great mystery of many writer-directors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios, but how they get any backing at all for their films.)normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters, but the couple in this film simply has no appeal. this is not the fault of either david krumholtz or milla jovavich; their characters are just poorly written. what we respond to in such classics as when harry met sally or annie hall or older films such as his girl friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters' personalities. lacking the ability to create individuals, burns gives us an after-school special inspired by men are from mars, women are from venus.how anyone can see burns as the successor to woody allen is beyond me. i did not laugh once during this film, and the screen-play is full of echo chamber dialog ("i want to paint the town red." "you want to paint the town red?"), which is the most tell-tale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living. in one of the early scenes, we see krumholz's actress girlfriend filming a mindless tv sitcom. it's the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right; maybe that indicates what burns talents are really suited for.

owen (david krumholtz) and chloe (denise richards) are a youngish couple living in manhattan. owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while chloe is an aspiring actress. happily for her, chloe gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to hollywood. missing her, owen books a flight to lala land, as a surprise. when he arrives at her set trailer, however, the "house" is shaking, as chloe and her hunky co-star are having a little romantic tryst. the writer and the actress are through. hurt and mad as a hatter, owen goes back to nyc. sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with nadine (milla jovovich) to get him out of his sulky funk. but, it goes badly, as the duo mix like oil and water, mostly due to each having a strong personality and owen's huge shoulder chip. yet, over the next few months, astonishingly, nadine and owen become pals, who confide in each other and hang out. can it turn into something more? well, who the heck cares! this film is so stupid that most folks will yank it out of the dvd player after the first ten minutes. the script is pathetic, dismal, and, oh, stupid, too. then again, krumholtz gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well. jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout? william baldwin, too, reaches a career low with his crude and sex-crazy role as owen's brother. the only cast member who is any good is richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one. okay, the costumes and production values are adequate. then, too, there is one clever element in that, occasionally, the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking. that doesn't save the film from "bomb" status. don't be stupid, dear film and romcom lovers. do not rent, buy, or borrow this gigantic turkey. i am the stupidest person on earth, today, for watching this thing until the bitter end.

milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her. i have learned to hate that crumpled little three-year-old face she makes whenever she pretends to cry. it makes any points she is trying to make as a serious actress drop off quickly. of course, in a movie with a baldwin and denise, she still shines as a mature actor person. david seemed to be doing woody allen by way of howdy doody. not a single word or gesture in the entire movie seemed sincere or even sincerely acted. "how harry met sally" and "two weddings and funeral", even "sleepless in seattle" had scripts, locations and actors. the script seemed to be a string of bad and crude gags separated by a lot of talking. the locations seemed to be within a few blocks of each other. there are only two actors in this dishrag of an indie flick, milla and the lady who played the chick who was into the stars. i watched most of this through the first time with the sound off, just watching milla. that subscript gag was old the first time i saw it and it's a silly rip off of a song in "how to succeed in business without really trying".

i was looking forward to this so much, being a big fan of the book. however, when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i've ever spent at the cinema.in principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why i'm rating this a 4.in this version, sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as "not just wicked, but vulgar." there's also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me; sara's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset. while the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn't leave you thinking, "oh puh-leeze."about the only things true to the book were:1. sara's father being a soldier 2. the lines between sara and her father ("are you learning me by heart?"/"no. i know you by heart. you are inside my heart.") 3. sara's friendship with becky, and her 'adopting' lottie (although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been) 4. the changing of her room by adding various luxury items. that part was brilliantly done. 5. the basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there, but that's about all that is.people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. possibly. all i can say to that is i have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book.if all you want is a 'feel-good' family film, then this delivers. if you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess (in fact, if you've read the book) don't waste time with this one. it's such a shame; with a cast like this, if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.am i harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much? very probably. but if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. preferably more than once.

i really wanted to love this film. i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. the book is marvelous. this film is very far from the book. the book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation.in the book, sara is honorable, kind, strong, and never does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. that's the point of the book! she behaves as a "princes" regardless of circumstances. an important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. it is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.in the book, she endures much and touches the lives of others. other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. sara does what is right simply because it is right.outside of the bakery, she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. she has half a dozen hot buns. she is very hungry. she gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. when she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun, she gives her another. she continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 i think - i don't remember how many.the baker is watching through the window. she is so moved by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. other people are similarly influenced by sara.and in the book, her father has died. the man next door is her father's partner - he has been looking for her. her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find sara; he takes her and becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. and sara has her full inheritance, of course.miss minchin is not a chimney sweep. in fact, she remains in her same post at the school. but she is humiliated as sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. and sara does speak to miss minchin in the end - miss minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of sara and sara with a calm steadfast demeanor, instructs miss minchin that she had been cruel.there is no comeuppance for miss minchin. she continues on in her miserable existence. it does not matter - what matters is that sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, becky, is now for all intents and purposes, her sister.the book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. it is about self control and humility. it is a wonderful book. this film does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book. my wife was so disgusted with it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. we were not rewarded.i cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that shirley temple acted in. i don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that i do not recognize it.don't waste your time - buy the book. it is unforgettable... even for a dad!

i absolutely despise this film. i wanted to love it - i really wanted to. but man, oh man - they were so off with sara. and the father living was pretty cheesy. that's straight out of the shirley temple film.i highly recommend the book. it is amazing. in the book, sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing... because it is right. she doesn't have a spiteful bone in her body.in the film, she is mean-spirited and spiteful. she does little things to get back at miss minchin. in the book, sara is above such things. she does stand up to miss minchin. she tells the truth and is not cowed by her. but she does not do the stupid, spiteful things that the sara in the film does.it's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie. i can't help but wonder... did we read the same book? the whole point of the book was personal responsibility, behaving with honor and integrity, always telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity.sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her. in the book, she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and becky. and miss minchin is not a chimney sweep - that part of the film really was stupid.to see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me. we are praising a film that glorifies petty, spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness? sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. i don't even recognize her in the film... she's not in it.good thing mrs. burnett isn't alive to see this horrid thing. it's ghastly and undeserving to bear the title of her book.

i have loved the book "a little princess" for most of my life, and was very excited that there was a movie. but i was appalled at this adaptation. not only is the acting wooden, and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book, but the theme is all wrong. the real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one, as sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child, even when she herself is very hungry. the theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses, which cheapens sara's actions considerably, and seems more like it should be written on a hallmark card than applied to this story.there are many other things wrong with this movie- too many to list, but here are just a few of the larger ones: this story should be set in britian in the mid 1800s, not america during the first world war. miss minchen is harsh to sara from the start, making her actions when sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning, as she is supposed to be. nowhere is it mentioned that becky is black. sara's father does *not* come back, he is dead. it is his closest friend, and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds sara, and restores her to her proper place. in fact, the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all, though they are the source of sara's wealth.all through everything that sara has faced, she always acts like a princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who hurt her. she would never have called lavinia a "snotty two faced bully". such a thing is completely out of character for her, and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what.this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that i have ever seen (with the notable exceptions of "ella enchanted", and "anne of green gables the continuing story")the plot of the book is wonderful, and skillfully written, so i do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting. i would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version, which is far superior. or better still, read the book. it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie.

this film is supposed to be about the frustrations of film making. it certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom. the setting is an attractive spanish seacoast resort with his usual large cast. the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script. just all ad-lib.a far superior film about the frustrations of film making is francois truffaut's "day for night" made in 1973. it shows all the delays and how the cast can misbehave in an intriguing manner. it doesn't bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film.

this is a piece of hollywood product that should have never left a film can. dialogue without a plausible thought, plot without a point, staging without skill, directing without direction, and acting without the worth of some backwater high school's freshman class play. the entire cast should have been arrested for over acting.but otherwise, okay!

i can only guess that this movie was an experiment that misfired. years earlier, it would have been moving images accompanied by music. later, it would have been sound added to silents. eventually it would have been technicolor, cinemascope or imax. this movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture. during all the emotional scenes, the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera. this interruption is painful at it's very least. imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on. painful. i have no idea who came up with this gimmick, but it was the only time i ever saw it used - and for good reason. in every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wring their hands, or overact to such a degree, i actually wondered if this was really a comedy. the story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations. norma shearer, disappointed in love, searches for a reason to live. she has a friend, played by ralph morgan, who worships her - but she takes him for granted. she is attracted to a doctor, played by clark gable, but he is self absorbed and isn't interested in her. she settles for a weakling that needs her desperately. she marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him. along comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in her oven, only to find out later that he loves her after all. the child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success, but she realizes that it's really clark she loves after all. confused yet? forget the rest, just watch a couple of episodes of "as the world turns" and it'll all become clear.if your are ever forced to watch this movie, hold out for the final scene. the gyrations of the actors put harold lloyd to shame. it is not to be missed.

a four-and-a-half-hour o'neill play gets boiled down to a little under two, and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts in voice-over. it can work onstage, but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap-opera adaptation, which soft-peddles its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men. norma shearer and alexander kirkland, overacting ludicrously, are outclassed by a naturalistic clark gable--he's the only one who makes the frozen-face technique work. it gets even funnier when shearer's and gable's son, a surly moppet, does the frozen-face shtick. there are also frank morgan's brother ralph as an unsuccessful suitor, given to soliloquizing "poor charlie!" over and over again, and a young robert young and maureen o'sullivan. by the time they show up, the voice-overs have largely been abandoned, and it plays as a ripe soap, with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays "silver threads among the gold" as background music. robert leonard's direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reining in hyperactive actors. it's certainly entertaining--there's nothing else like it, unless you count groucho's satirical parody in "animal crackers," or an old mad magazine satire that rendered shirley booth's sitcom "hazel" a la "strange interlude". but it isn't good.

the movie gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so very different. it features a cast acting while you can hear their thoughts and desires! this is truly a weird film and an experience i won't forget. the only problem is that the experiment, though in some ways interesting, is generally quite dull and unengaging. in fact, it's amazing that a norma shearer and clark gable film could be this dull! the film is based on a eugene o'neill play and it really does seem quite stagy. in fact, it would have been best just to keep it as a stage production--it just didn't translate at all to the big screen.so this movie is only recommended to die-hard cinemaniacs and those who love gable films so much they just have to see all his films!

eugene o'neill is acclaimed by some as america's leading playwright, but for things like the iceman cometh, long day's journey into night, the emperor jones. strange interlude was a piece of experimentation he concocted where the characters on stage, look aside to the audience and say what they really are thinking and then resume conversation. it was a nine hour production with a dinner break on broadway, so you can safely assume a lot has been sacrificed here.for the screen the voice over regarding the thoughts is used for all the characters. it probably is a technique better suited to the screen. sir laurence olivier did very well with it in his version of hamlet. but bill shakespeare gave olivier a lot better story than o'neill gave his players in this instance.players like clark gable, norma shearer, ralph morgan, may robson, etc. are a lot more animated in most of their films than they are in strange interlude. the story takes place over a 20 year period. norma shearer is a young woman whose intended is killed in world war i. she starts playing around quite a bit, although that part is not shown in this version. she makes the acquaintance of alexander kirkland and his friend clark gable. she also has as a perennial suitor, ralph morgan, a friend of her father's henry b. walthall.she marries kirkland, but then is warned by his mother may robson and shown that insanity gallops in that family to quote another literary work. since kirkland wants kids and shearer and robson think kirkland's train will slip the track if he doesn't get one, gable is recruited for breeding purposes. of course you can see all the complications this can cause and o'neill explores them all.gable is so terribly miscast in an o'neill production, but he was an up and coming player at mgm and did what they told him. shearer does what she can to lift a very dreary story, but she seems defeated at the start. best in the film is possibly robson who puts some real bite in her dialog.strange interlude ran for 426 showings on broadway in 1928-1929 and starred glenn anders and lynn fontanne in the gable and shearer parts. perhaps no one could really have saved the film because two years earlier, groucho marx lampooned the stuffings out of it in animal crackers. after seeing what he did, i don't think the movie going public took it too seriously.and since it's not the best of o'neill, neither could i.

eugene o'neill's 4 and a half hour 1927 play brought to the screen in less than two hours. the play's combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasn't aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it, especially norma shearer's nina and ralph morgan's marsden. clark gable as ned darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits gable's range. once the plot settles down to the love quadrangle and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable. the technique used here for the asides is another problem. on stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience. here they're done as voiceovers. you'd think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts. plus it's difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of groucho marx's hilarious parody version in "animal crackers." added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons (nina's promiscuity is soft-peddled and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play) and a wretched score (uncredited) that sounds like background music to a turn-of-the-century weepie. o'neill called this film "a dreadful hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship," and although "strange interlude" is nowhere near as great as his later "the iceman cometh" and "long day's journey into night," it certainly deserved better than this.

in one sense, i kind of liked this movie because of a 'mindless', positive atmosphere it sort of conveys. i had a problem with an aspect of the plot, but more about that later. first, the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional. the 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. the basic storyline was ok (pretty simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or objectionable. the main attraction was, of course, the miniature dinosaurs - kind of a nice fantasy element to have. however, they had a very minimal presence in the movie.outside of that, the movie kept a brisk pace and didn't get too bogged down in any one place. i liked this about the movie.the problem i had with the plot had to do with the the idea of "stealing". i think this movie may not have been thought out enough - something's wrong especially if this is a kid's movie. i'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler (skip it if you're worried). the 'good guys' do some stealing and they don't have the same info the audience has - so it's just stealing and that's kind of a bad thing for a kid's movie.overall, if you have kids, because of a questionable plot aspect i'd consider passing. however, this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter. pass this one if you have any other interesting choices.

if you are a six-year-old boy who's into dinosaurs, you will love this movie. if you are anybody else, you'll be rolling your eyes about every 15 seconds. if you want to start picking on things like the acting, the special effects, the dialogue, or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest amount of sense, you'll have plenty of material. if all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid, it will do just fine. that said, there's a lot of kids' entertainment out there that's much smarter, and some of it is even bearable or enjoyable for adults. unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur mood, you're probably better off looking for something else.

for some unknown reason, 7 years ago, i watched this movie with my mother and sister. i don't think i've ever laughed as hard with them before. this movie was sooooo bad. how sequels were produced is beyond me. its been awhile since i last saw this "movie", but the one impression that it has stuck with me over the years has been, "they must have found the script in a dumpster in the backlot of a cheap movie studio, made into a "movie", and decided that it didn't suck enough, and made it worse. i'm pretty sure that they spent all the budget on camera work and the so called "special effects", and then had 13 cents left toward the script and to pay the "actors".

i never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that i subscribe to the hbo service. now i know better! jack is usually one of my favorite actors but not even he could rescue this part. not that he tried. jack plays his usual wiitches of eastwick type character. unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the american southwest. he is about as believable a cowboy desperado as pee wee herman. there is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails. he is almost to goofy. the remainder of the cast was worse. timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of 1978 and the others appeared to be just happy to be there. my recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry.

this movie basically uses spousal rape as one of its main comedic devices. now i turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her, but i cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny. this movie not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny, it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic. how so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me. "i sure enjoyed canning those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it. watching a peeping tom jerk off is not family fun. i honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy "comedy" and am totally baffled by these positive reviews.

marlene dietrich is magnificent as concha perez, the temptress who drives all men to despair in josef von sternberg's "the devil is a woman". her performance has nothing to do with 'acting' in any conventional sense but she's incandescent, a true star in full command of her material. but she's the only good thing about the film, (she's so good she keeps you watching this dross; i doubt if any other actress could have done the same).the story is an appallingly lame melodrama, (surely pierre louys' novel was better), in which dietrich's amoral concha ruins the lives of two friends played by lionel atwill and cesar romero with a stiffness bordering on petrification. and for von sternberg it's an ugly looking movie, (maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter). bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough of it to remake it as "that obscure object of desire" with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all, down to casting two different actresses in the same role. neither film is either director's finest hour and while the bunuel version may be the better film, it is dietrich's 'performance' you remember.

a sadly predictable, clichéd story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. sadly, too, the screenplay is by the once-great experimental novelist john dos passos, from an original by french exotic potboiler pierre louys. this time marlene dietrich is concha, a manipulative, cold-hearted spanish beauty. don pasqual (lionel atwill) raises her from the cigarette factory, but she ditches him. he warns his tall young friend antonio (cesar romero) against her, but to no avail. a duel ensues, concha reproaches pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for, so he doesn't: he points his pistol at the sky, but antonio shoots him. but instead of going off to paris with the young victor, she goes back to the man who would have died for her. with an unexpected bit by edward everett horton as a spanish governor. dietrich plays the part of a spanish woman by moving constantly, twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back, flouncing, tossing her head, and so forth. and she makes faces, and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. the photography is strangely crowded: no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room, no consecutive scene of dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change. the carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the sargasso sea.

this is far the most worst film i've seen this year from bollywood so far. i may not lie, my wife liked this film very much. it was not bobby deol or arjun rampal what made this film become unbelievable, but it was amisha patel. she performs the role of a blind woman who get in trouble when she almost fall from a mountain where (luckily for her) the hero arjun rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). it amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain, because she cannot see her environment. from this scene i started to watch the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of amisha patel. the way she plays a blind girl is very bad. the only way she does that is by not to look into the eyes of the person she talks with. when i saw this film, i respected rani mukherjee more with her performance in the movie black. amisha will never reach this level in performing as an actress.anyway, she falls in love with arjun rampal. it is the cliché story. sudden arjun gets killed by a man who is madly in love with amisha. amisha is in despair, but then bobby enters the movie. he also falls in love with the blind girl. bobby deol is a great actor in my point of view, but he cannot pull the film to a higher level where amisha patel buries it deep into the ground. i must say bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he got so far. bobby grew in acting from the first movie his lovely daddy gave him. he was so bad in acting in barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you get the shivers and believe every word he says. only a movie with high potential like a yash copra film has to meet his way.okay, when amisha also falls in love with bobby, someones enters her life. arjun rampal is not dead! who believes this crap? i don't. why didn't they give his role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family (shushant singh or aryeman ramsay) and give bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with amitabh bachchan? i'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like bobby to give him a great role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with amisha (bigscreen t.v. face) patel. this movie was so awful, that i regret buying it.

this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. they said this was the man's answer to waiting to exhale...all i'm going to say is that we really didn't respond at all. i couldn't believe that it was actually made. the director should choose another profession, because he can't make a movie. the script wasn't good. it made no sense and was very messy. bet movies are much better than this was, and i was horribly disappointed to see the talented actor terrence in this bad excuse of a movie. if i could turn back the hands of time i wouldn't go back to media play to never buy the movie, i would just keep it wrapped sitting on the shelf, instead of wasting my time watching it.

i would not be giving away too much of the film to tell you that there are many, many, many, many scenes of lucas (the young protagonist) walking and looking at things! yep. and you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is pointless, meaningless, and pretty much ignored for the rest of the film!this movie is populated by dull people who do dull things, and the dullest person of them all is young lucas, who is going blind and needs an operation. you see, he has delusions, terrible delusions! he thinks a killer is preying on blind women! he walks around a lot and acts like an insufferable jerk!patience does not pay off with this film. by the end, the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it is very hard to care one way or the other about what any of the nightmarish images meant. nothing is made clear, the film moves at a snail's pace, and it left me with the same effects of a hangover.judging from "afraid of the dark," the british don't make stupid thrillers like the americans do; they make boring ones.

afraid of the dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written, all too short for a feature length film, then spliced together clumsily into this frankenstein's monster.at his best, the protagonist, lucas, is creepy. as hard as it is to draw a bead on the secondary characters, they're far more sympathetic.afraid of the dark could have achieved mediocrity had it taken just one approach and seen it through -- and had it made lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and off-putting. i wanted to see him packed off into an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life.

there's not that much to say in the end. one would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past. it just seems like he did it without actually caring. the actors are doing their job (though belmondo is far from amazing), but you just don't get hooked. in a word, it's boring. this is even more disappointing since i heard several time that this movie could be considered as a reaction to all the big american blockbusters, which are considered to be a threaten to the french exception by those who just can't admit they should turn to another job. i tell you, if that's the best reaction we're supposed to get, boy, i'm going to be really depressed soon...

let me get started with a terrible storyline and an awful control system. good animation but not too good graphics. that is why i'm giving this game 4 of 10. this game really needs an improvement if you ask me!!! i would remake it and make this control system better so jaws is not so damn hard to control. if i made it to improve it i would make those graphics look better than on the movie. it will drive anyone crazy when you are getting killed so freaking easy. i played this and got killed by a diver when he had one of those flick knives in 2 hits. the dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will be begging to go to the bottom of hell. this game sucks some fat ass. sorry about all the cussing i think i'm done now. it just that this game sucks so bad that it should be taken off the store's shelf. i dare you to play the garbage and you will probably get so mad by dieing so easy so don't play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said "let's make fun of the russians and at the same time show people how advanced we (americans) are". the movie portrays the russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the americans. it is true that american campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other countries are. however, this movie goes to far and it exaggerates the differences between east and west. to me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the cold war.

ok everybody is so enthused by this film i hardly dare add a negative review but i just did not enjoy this movie.i have to say first i saw the film in russian language overdub so i will have missed some dialog, but not much.nice things first. there are some hilarious moments (the elvis impersonator for instance). actors seem well casted, also the russians. efremova is great and goldblum is very good. which brings us to the downsides of this movie. first of all. there is hardly any story and the end we know already: yeltsin wins. so no drama or suspense. they tried to solve this problem with an emerging affair between the actors mentioned above, but that story kind of evaporates.more importantly, the film does not represent reality. the russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous lot. i am willing to believe that flying in some spin-doctors from the states helped yeltsin win his campaign, but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are: who financed the campaign, what did they get in return, how was the opposition handled apart from airing some commercials?so what we have here is a film, loosely based on reality (but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without plot or subplot.

when you read the comment on this film, that it's smart and funny political comedy based on true events - the only true word here is that it's a comedy. if you're told it's insider movie about russian politics - it's not. there's probably only 2% in the movie from what really happened in russia during that election-campaign. in reality of the 1996 it was thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a real funky election-campaign. well, there were pr-advisers from the us working in the yeltsin's staff, but their role was just minimal. the whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the movie, it would be much funnier showing all the president's people riding across the country with paper boxes full of cash, and the celebrities giving the shows to support yeltsin all over the place - at least that would be true. i give it three only because of the respect to jeff goldblum, antony lapagglia, and liev schreiber. and about the machine guns on the streets of moscow. i was living in the place that had the highest amount of hard crime in russia in the middle of 90-s and never seen a man with the gun on the street.

johnnie (bert wheeler) is a would-be songwriter; newton (robert woolsey) is a would-be inventor. both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. johnnie wants to sell a song to winfield lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. lake's secretary, mary (betty grable), is johnnie's sweetheart. when lake turns up dead, circumstances conspire to make mary and newton think that johnnie is the killer. they conspire again to implicate mary, who goes to jail. but who really shot lake? who is the black widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? the other characters in this wacky murder mystery are: lake's suspicious wife, a self-satisfied private detective, a seemingly slow-witted janitor (willie best), lake's auditor, a songwriter who thinks lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him. it's up to newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer.the baby-voiced wheeler and the cigar-chomping woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing, but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny.not this one. george stevens, who went on to have a distinguished career, directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot. but two scenes are good, and both feature wheeler and betty grable singing the excellent "music in my heart," written by dorothy fields and jimmy mchugh. the first time, they sing it walking up a staircase (after which they dance back down). later, wheeler and woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to mary, who is in a jail cell on a high floor. wheeler and grable sing to each other through the bars."the nitwits" has a few laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by woolsey's line: "sonny, you've got the brain of a six-year-old boy. and i'll bet even he was glad to get rid of it." it's watered-down grouchowho didn't use the superfluous "even" when he said it.

well, don't bother. this film looks so tired, the acting is so old-fashioned, and the plot and characters so drab, that it should be studied instead of watched. it is really a horrible waste of film; stereotypes, clichés, nonsense, and amateurish film-making. i watched it in unbelievable awe with my mouth wide open. how could such a film be made, and more interestingly, how could anyone find it funny or watchable? old, tired, sloppy... a junior-high skit, at best. there is nothing watchable there, except for a study of very ancient film. not good film, just ancient. this is not abbott and costello or laurel and hardy. this is nonsense. the acting is so bad that maybe it is worth it to watch just for the laugh. some films are so bad that they are good. but, this one goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again.

ever have one of those sneezes that seems to build up forever? you gasp and you convulse and you grab the nearest paper product in preparation for the world's greatest hanky-blower...and then it fizzles. "frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of that lost sneeze. now, i'm big on b-movies, and i always look the other way when a boom mike pops onscreen or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of gerald ford, but this one really let me down. the cover of the video, for instance, is the tag-line of the whole movie. using parts from murdered new york prostitutes, dr. franken rebuilds his deceased fiancee, only to have her run amok in manhattan as a sort of superprostitute with a bad attitude. after an hour and a half of build-up, this fairly funny ten minutes seemed a little anti-climactic.

this showed up on a dvd a buddy of mine bought for me. they had it listed as "the savage guns" which was an entirely different movie. obviously the folks who packaged the dvd never bothered to look at what they were burning on the disk.anyway, this movie is about as bad as they come. the sound track is a combination tv batman/early james bond/spaghetti western. lots of galloping around to this music. it appears that the guy has to gallop between scenes to burn up some time and give the sound track folks something to do.english is dubbed over the italian and it really shows. i wish it had been just a little bit worse and then it would have had some of the campy feel of the ed wood films. as it is, it is just plain awful.

at it's core, this is a fairly typical revenge western, heavy on the spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist comes through successfully defeating the main villain. however there's so much going on that has no bearing on the story that you have to wonder what the film makers were thinking about. i'm referring to stuff like the way miss rosie's singing number just pops up out of nowhere and the boxing match in the middle of town. ok, they have a loose connection to the influence villain mash flanagan has, but why all of a sudden does he turn up with an alias - mr. donovan.on the flip side, i thought it was pretty innovative how the camera shot showing the wounded wallach's view of the trail might have been filmed by someone with an actual bullet in his shoulder. and wasn't it great the way donovan's girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little frisky? don't let me forget either the great stunt work by the gravel pit bad guys as wallach guns them down as part of the finale.still, there was one thing unaccounted for, and i kept waiting the entire movie for it. whatever happened to that trio of hoods that flanagan/donovan hires near the start of the picture? you know, the guy martel that a funeral parlor wanted to hire for his gun prowess, the devil's henchman mitchell with the rifle, and the knife thrower lincoln tate. each had a five thousand dollar bounty on his head, and they were supposed to protect donovan from the guy who survived the massacre of the opening scene. they were never heard from again! i like to think that maybe donovan just had them killed and kept the 15k all for himself.

savage guns (video title) is a dirt cheap, bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead, catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss.despite plenty of violence, this manages to be both dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor.lead actor robert woods lives up to his name with a wooden and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever. in other words, the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that he's the protagonist.the worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy german accent. it was the worst scene in blazing saddles and the worst one here!

this early film from director bob clark ("porky's", "black christmas", "a christmas story") didn't really pump my nads like i expected. in fact, it straight up annoyed me. it's about a theater troupe who sail to a burial island, consisting of dead criminals, where they plan to conjure some evil forces and resurrect some corpses... the leader of their group, a conceited black-magic enthusiast and possible homosexual, attempts to summon satan's help with the re-animation of an exhumed body, which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby, deserted caretaker's house and play with it... nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the desecrater's. the make-up effects are okay, the gore is very minimal (pg rating), and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much, which really got on my nerves. i guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some "comedic" status, yet i found no humor in it, whatsoever. the entire concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did. the characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring... don't waste your time with it...

it's always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre. my expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion.children shouldn't play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out. the whole idea of a band of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses had me intrigued. however, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. the actors,who for the most part were competent and amazingly expressive, were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization. some of these characters go from ambivalence about the whole act of defiling a cemetery, to outspoken criticism, back to ambivalence. it's one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film; it's another to produce an overly dynamic, circular attitude that loops every ten minutes.another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead? even with the aforementioned flaws, i would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since i believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency. the scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting (even to a veteran zombie enthusiast) by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound, and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead. current filmmakers should learn from cspwdt about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development.all in all, if you are zombie movie completionist like me, you should take time to locate and view this movie. it's a fun watch.

i'd heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it, but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film's low budget and poor acting - both of which i can deal with when it comes to zombie films. however, what i didn't count on is this film being really, really boring; if there's one thing you can count on from low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment - but unfortunately, this film has neither. i'm quite surprised, because the previous two horror films i've seen from director bob clark - deathdream and black christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining films, but children shouldn't play with dead things just doesn't cut it. the plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life. however, they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood!the plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick, but what i didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the final twenty minutes; and as this is a ninety minute movie, i'm sure you can guess that this isn't a good thing. the opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters. i can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along; but please, if you're going to spend so long on it, you've really got to make it interesting. all of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying, and personally i just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. the film is not without its merits, however, as the atmosphere is a standout. lucio fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well; but bob clark already did it with this film. the direction isn't bad either, but it's brought down by poor make-up effects and a distinct lack of blood, which isn't likely to please fans of zombie movies. overall, i really can't recommend this film; but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you may get a kick out of it.

this is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.melanie griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed.jeff daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage.strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director jonathan demme. his work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. i mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. but he did it well, anyway.still, there was one bright, shining aspect: ray liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! hypnotic! enthralling.i saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theater. for some strange reason, my friend loved it. i sort of think it's because melanie griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she shouldn't have), though he tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons.anyway, i thought even then, after his first scene, that ray liotta would become a major star, or at least a major, highly-respected actor.despite the garbagey aspects of the garbagey script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, liotta made it almost worth watching. in fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far ray liotta has come. i mean, for one thing, his name is now usually listed at or near the top.even then, even in a pile of garbage, ray liotta shone like a diamond.just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. every major character is either amoral or immoral. terrible movie. terrible movie idea.added comment: too many people answer "was this comment helpful?" with a "no" because they disagree with the expressed opinion. maybe imdb should ask that question instead: "do you agree with these opinions?"

the movie opens with charlie (jeff daniels), a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli. it appears he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check. instead of reaching for his plastic, he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying. unbeknownst to charlie, "lulu" (melanie griffith) had been observing him from the other side of the deli."lulu" is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980's with a brunette page-boy cut. she follows him out to let him know that she saw what he did. he tries to deny it but can't escape her accusation. thinking he's in it, charlie is surprised when "lulu" says she doesn't work for the deli and then offers him a ride back to work.when she heads in the opposite direction, thus begins their cavorting across the middle atlantic seaboard.we're supposed to get titillated as thoroughly modern "lulu" puts straight-laced charlie into humiliating situations. it's all right when the two consenting adults get a little kinky in a motel room but off-putting when they wriggle out of paying the check at a family-style restaurant. stealing the labor from hard-working people is not my idea of "wild". charlie is a jerk."lulu" is a loony jerk. she starts to pass off charlie as her husband. first to her mom (who blithely tolerates the charade) and then at her conveniently timed 10-year high school reunion (an event used later by another too-cool-for-its-own-good movie "grosse pointe blank").the "marriage" comes as a surprise to "lulu"'s real husband (ray liotta)who's just been recently released from prison for armed robbery. ray gives the two a welcome comeuppance and shows them how nasty crime really is.i can't add any irony by writing that i first watched this by sneaking in the movie theater. no, i don't do that sort of thing. i taped it off of cable tv and assure you i view it strictly in the privacy of my own home.so i got to thinking why i taped it when i don't like it very much and conclude that 20 years ago i was on a reggae kick and the soundtrack of "something wild" does prominently feature reggae. the closing credits start with the treat of sister carol performing her version of "wild thing".

there needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. it was painful to watch, but strangely compelling all the same. compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much. i kept thinking "it must get better." it got worse. and worse. how on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk i'll never know. the most surprising thing of all though, is all these reviews i see of people actually loving the movie. yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very very very bad. worst movie ever!

something not-so-great. "silence of the lambs" remains demme's only good film, and i'm of course including all the overrated, left-wing exercises in big-screen indulgence some of which i haven't seen - and never will.this is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half-way. the first half is a little hard to sit through; it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. daniels plays an over-the-top dumb-as-dirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief. his animated acting is often annoying, and barely funny. he actually lies to griffith at the outset and tells her that he is married, with children, when in fact he is divorced! in all the history of mankind and movies any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie - if he lies - and say that he isn't married. (later on, the not-at-all credible or believable rationale behind this was revealed: he wanted to "protect (himself)". what a load of crap...) the fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the dumb things in the movie made me actually look forward to liotta pounding on him when he caught up with him in the former's apartment.what then happens in daniels's apartment is the classic end-of-movie fight-to-the-death which the good guy - albeit the very dumb good guy - predictably wins. still, at least the last half-hour has some action, something going on, and daniels isn't given any more the opportunity to be animated. the film lacks credible characters (whether main or marginal), and the feel of it is too 80s which means the movie has a rather bland look; visually ugly. sayles yet again makes a cameo as a policeman. the film is also perhaps a bit too heavy on the coincidences side. griffith once again plays a soft-talking dumb-sounding bimbo, but, as usual, she is convincing because she is a soft-talking dumb-sounding bimbo. this was an earlier film, before her lip-enlargement and breast-enlargement surgery; compare the natural breasts she exposes in this film to the ready-to-explode balloons she briefly flashes years later in "nobody's fool".if you're interested in reading my "biographies" of griffith and other hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.

i can imagine what happened for this film to come into being: a bunch of studio guys are sitting around, drinking gin-and-tonic, maybe a joint, and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap, which at that time was about as far apart as archie bunker and mick jagger. something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting-- for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. what interested hippies? asia, philosophy, pacifism, and wild sets and costumes. what interested their parents? musicals, eye candy, a feel-good script, and nostalgia. very well, then, "lost horizon", the old classic, as a musical, in color. can't miss, right? it was a bomb. lost horizon, by james hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. in broad terms, he sketches out a utopian society in shangri-la, "the valley of the blue moon", near tibet, inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of <i>very</i> long-lived monks. intruding into paradise is a gilligan's island-like planeful of outsiders (a veteran of wwi, a missionary, etc.) each with their own spin on the situation -- what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise, or try to return to the tumult of the twentieth century. taken on its own terms, it's gentle, pop-lit fluff, presenting hilton's own conservative british views in "oriental" dress, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. as captive honored guests of the monks, the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but never pressed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of that themselves), treated royally, and given simple, yet luxurious accomodations --who'd want to escape? in this middle american heaven-on-earth, the monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changes. the nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look pretty, and even flirt a bit ( the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of tantric sex i've ever read). even their religion is nonthreatening: revealed as a best-of-both worlds blend of christianity and buddhism, there's little to offend any but the staunchest fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about tibet (which in the early thirties was a very small number).as a capra film focussing on the adventure/character interplay angles it was enchanting; and perhaps steven spielburg could have made it fly, if he'd been around. as an early-seventies hollywood product, the adventure was over too quickly, and the updated roster of characters too bland, to make much of an impression. deprived of the sketchy, suggestive qualities of classic b&w, the monastery resembles a de luxe beauty spa in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the monks' robes tried for historical accuracy, most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and fango bath, with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon. maybe stephan sondheim could have restored some grit to the story, playing up the very real conflict inside each character's reaction; just five years afterwards, brian eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a t; instead, bert bacherach and hal david were given the job of writing the songs, which marry muzak-like melodies with some of the clunkiest new agey lyrics ever penned. quite naturally for the time, every song calls for a dance number, which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring, and so is the script, which has not one line worth quoting.tie-ins with this movie were legion -- there were everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film, and such was the hype that i actually went out and bought the sountrack album. just about the only thing good i can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after -- the next month i read aldous huxley, bought a copy of the bardo thadol, and hence learned about real tibetan culture. moan.

..but unfortunately no one thought about having van killed in order to save this doomed production. the only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice...too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy. why did i hate van so much? well, throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate soupy sales imitation--with lots of mugging, bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. the worst of these moments was when he was "teaching" the class--these kids laughed at everything he did. heck, van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! now van was not the only bad casting decision in the film--he was just the most obvious. of course, having john gielgud (a lovely actor) play an asian was ridiculous as well as having michael york play peter finch's brother!! the bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices, the film was doomed from the start....and the worst of them was the god-awful bobby van. now in real life, he might have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here i just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet.now i also mentioned the songs--egad, those terrible songs!! the original lost horizon by frank capra was a subtle delight throughout--and not a single song and dance number in the film. so why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film? they only served to make it seem like a gooey mess--like the original doctor doolittle combined with lost horizon. the end result is a sickly sweet children's movie--not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8.now if you can remove these problems, you have the basis of a decent film. after all, the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo. peter finch is particularly good (though certainly not the equal of ronald colman in the original). but, considering that the original was a near-perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. who wants to wade through the treacle?! by the way, this film was included in "the 50 worst films" book by harry medved. while i, too, disliked the film, it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. i think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. an excellent book--just not one of the best selections to the "hallowed hall" of dreck.

during filming, was vanessa redgrave taking mogadon? it was like she was reading from an autocue. i've seen more life in a wooden spoon. or perhaps that was all part of the character? whatever, it was very very annoying, i kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up. i read the book a long time ago & didn't like much about it except that septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but i don't think rupert graves showed this very well, his acting was all on the surface. the connection between his life and clarissa's is not very well done either but i suspect the attempt is to show the sacrifice soldiers made to enable people like clarissa to continue their vapid lives. the film is very bitty and has no real unity to it. hated it.

pretty twisted horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good. all the characters are ok, and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull, however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. it's well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up the pace, plus i found the ending to be disappointing. linnea quigley has no more then a very small role in this so, i was also disappointed about that, and stephen knight does a good job as the lead, as he was pretty twisted, plus i got this in a dvd horror set called a taste of evil, along with a bunch of other horror films. there is lots of blood,however it's not all that gory, and for it's low budget it was pretty well done, however as i said it just couldn't sustain it's interest. this is a pretty twisted horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good, i would pass,but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing better to do. the direction is ok. elly kenner&norman thaddeus vane do an ok job here with decent camera work, and doing a good job on it's low budget, however the pace is too inconsistent for my liking. the acting is actually alright. stephen knight is great as the lead, he was creepy, twisted, sick, and gave a very creepy performance, the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person. linnea quigley did well in her small role. christopher mcdonald is ok i guess sin his short time. rest of the cast are ok as well. overall i would pass, but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do. *1/2 out of 5

i was an extra on this film, in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; i was one of the fleeing (mostly mexican) bangladeshi refugees running across the runways at ryan field in tucson. at one point, standing around in our turbans as we waited for another shot, one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about. i told him it was going to be a remake of lost horizons, only as a musical. there was a long pause, then he replied: "man, this movie is gonna suck". pretty perceptive of him, i thought. i had a good time and made a bit of money, but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie i can't sit through the whole thing. if you ever saw the movie "the swarm", you can pretty much get the idea. you get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just bad. the idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names, then a good story and good writing aren't necessary. just turn the big crank, and out comes the product. it's just not worth watching.

intriguing premise should have been a 20 minute short. that's how long it would take his biological parents to think, "hmm, we lost one son (and never found him) who is about his age, and he looks like our remaining son. oh, yes, and he's a runaway. hmm." but no, this is the most clueless family in history. and the conclusion, while trying to jerk tears, manages only to induce more groans of disbelief.

slaughter trail is a b western with some grand pretensions. but it's come down in hollywood history for a most ignominious reason.watching this film with it's musical score which can only be described as overbearing, i have a feeling what howard hughes was trying to do is recruit a singing cowboy for rko films. they already had tim holt who was as reliable a b picture cowboy hero there ever was, but he was not a singer. i guess hughes saw what money herbert j. yates was raking in with roy rogers over at republic and decided he'd get one as well.so terry gilkyson who was a very good performer and much better song writer got recruited and sang some of his material which was not his best and worse, looked like they were shoehorned into the picture. but worse than that, there's this annoying chorus which sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors, extras, even the horses. needless to say terry never got to be a singing cowboy. but he did write such classics as the bare necessities and dean martin's great hit, memories are made of this.the plot concerns an inside woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery. that's right, the outlaws who are gig young, myron healey, and ken koutnik plant virginia grey in the coach as a passenger which they receive word is carrying some valuable jewels. it's a great act grey and young pull off. young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they do properly act out the scene within earshot of the passengers, but what he does is slip her the swag. last place the authorities might look, if she doesn't run off with it.but when they flee the robbery it's on tired horses so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement mounts and shoot three navajos who object. that puts the navajos back on the warpath, didn't help that one of the casualties was chief ric roman's brother.that's the situation that captain brian donlevy at the fort has to deal with when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection. how it all works out is predictable, but in a gaudy sort of overproduced way.in fact that's the problem with slaughter trail. it's a simple no frills b western that got souped up into something almost grotesque.but the real reason slaughter trail entered into history is that this film apparently marks the official beginning of the blacklist. originally howard dasilva was to play donlevy's part and may have in fact completed his scenes, when howard hughes officially fired him for communist sympathies. his scenes were completely re-shot with brian donlevy in the lead.considering what a fiasco this film turned into, i'm not sure whether donlevy or dasilva ought to have thanked hughes or kicked him in his private preserve.

to remake "lost horizon", as a musical, the need for a rodgers & hammerstein or lerner & lowe type musical composition was needed. burt bacharach and hal david were the wrong choice. having said that, my favorite thing about "lost horizon", is its score. it's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. the cast, is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (ullman, finch and hussey, were all dubbed, and still don't sound all that great).frankly, the novella, on which this, and the earlier non-musical film versions were based, is mediocre, at best. while the possibilities for a truly good, cinematic musical version exist, they are not realized here. the film succeeds at being a good, rainy-day vehicle, to pass the time. otherwise, you are better off, buying the cd of its soundtrack. only recommended as a curiosity piece, due to the film's awful reputation. i've seen much better; but i've seen much worse.

my first impression when i read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very, very different from the book. the movie trailer said that the movie is supposed to take place when vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in america. she meets aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist. working in a chocolate shop in the day, she must accept that she will never be normal, because every full moon, she becomes a loup-garou--a thought-to-be mythical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolf.most of the little changes didn't sound too bad to me, even though i am a fan of the book with the shared titled by annette curtis klause. i knew it would be different, but i wanted to see it to support the book, thinking that an age change, a setting change, and a few little occupation changes wouldn't impact the storyline as a whole enough to make me want to tear my eyes out of their sockets and leave myself bleeding on the movie theatre ground.the movie unnecessarily killed off many important characters, one being esme, vivan's mother, right off the bat in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father. i pushed that aside and ventured forth into the movie, weary and slightly annoyed. running through romania, the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful, and the music was... interesting... but it left me with the impression of, "why does vivian look like that, and why is she wearing a hoodie?" jumping to later parts of the movie, i must say that i am surprised that the screenplay writers seemed to support incest in a way and rather than sticking to the character relationship from the book between vivian and rafe, the leader of the five now became her cousin through her (surprise!) aunt astrid, who, in the novel, was the bitter and hated rival of vivan's mother, and, might i add, no way related to either of them.to top off character distortions, gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed over vivian being his mate so they could fulfill some nonexistent prophecy. not only did his physical appearance take a complete 180 from the description in the book, he was, apparently, also the father of rafe. yes, that's right, it's a nice little incestuous knot of wolfies all bundled up tight.little things that irked me were scenes like the forest hunts. there was a red-head that stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one who "kissed their enemy" before their prey was set free to run and be hunted. why was she there? why did she look like astrid? i suppose my mind is not vast enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to why she existed other than to kiss pretty victims.i loved how the amoeba was completely cut out of the movie. i loved how legally entwined aiden's past was, what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he was telling vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then beat his father up "in self-defense" to make him seem like such a tragic character.character 180s are a lot of fun when they are completely unnecessary. at the end of the movie, i felt as if some person skimmed over the novel, scribbled down half the list of character names, drew a few connections here and there, mentioned that gabriel was a bit of a jerk, vivian fell in love with aiden, he fears her when he finds out she is a loup-garou of the legends, and "somebody" is "killed by a silver bullet" and there is some sort of happy ending because vivian finally feels accepted by somebody who loves her for who she is.i gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent, and the casting could have been worse, but as far as directing goes, why do the loup-garous leap into the air in human form as if they want to fly (with their arched backs and penchant to leap from high places), shimmer briefly, and then fall onto the ground as wolves? the only aspects of this movie that even had me watch it through to the very-sordid, sorry ending were the wolves, the beautiful scenery, and the eye-candy boys.all-together, i must say that in order to enjoy this film at all, one must be ready for misconceptions, strange happenings that are not always explained, incestuous innuendos, and have either not liked the book, or have not read the book.

the only reason i didn't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it...the only and i repeat the only effect that they used is a weird kapoera (from india?) jump on a half meter wall/trash cans, i mean, effects doesn't make a movie but... sheesh.... me and my friend hoped the entire movie for some real effect (a huge wolf?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo... all we got is a jump! on a 0.5 meter wall + they used pharmacy's ..... and they found guns?! in the pharmacy?! i mean what the hell? oh i forgot, there was another effect- contact lances as green eyes! every 10 min we shouted "the only thing that can save the movie from the disgrace is a giant wolf who kills them all!!! besides that the script was so awful that you don't know who you would like to die first. you actually pray (and i mean pray!) that the "good?!" guy will die, hopefully in the beginning.make yourself a favour and send letters to delete the movie from every archives in the world.

there were only two redeeming features about this movie; the beauty of bucharest and its architecture, and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form. forget about the plot or storyline from the book - they're completely absent from this movie. in fact, about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players. even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations. if the film makers had made a good movie, even though unrelated to the book, i wouldn't have been so disappointed. unfortunately, they did not. the plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks, the acting is wooden, and the directorial efforts mundane. oh yes, the way the loup garou bow to their leader is pure hoke. i suppose a nod of recognition is due for the animal handlers. the wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles.

this movie was boring. very much like underworld, only even less interesting. it's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film. the lead couple were boring. i totally didn't care about vivian and aiden. and there was so little character development that i didn't care about any character in the film. the plot was paper thin. the transformations were basically nil. i did like the wolves themselves, might as well have have done a wolf documentary, i would have liked that better. i wouldn't recommend this movie. i didn't find it fun or interesting. it just drags and everyone in it is a boring drag. this movie could win an award for how not to make a werewolf film.
