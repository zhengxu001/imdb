this show started out okay, but then it turned into a nightmare. the worst part about it was the contestants. most of them were weirdos. they did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. in the second season, one guy said he that he talked to his pants. that is sick and repulsive. also, no one cared about winning money. all they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was "survivor" or something. the men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together. the women were the same also. i just couldn't take it anymore. i had to stop watching it. it was truly one of the worst shows ever.

the summary was promising but watching the movie was a huge disappointment. nothing happens in this movie. plot is linear and without surprise. normal characters stay normal until end of the film, weird characters stay weird until end of the film. there is even not a single tentative to foul the viewer into thinking that the bad guy is someone else than the most obvious candidate. on the positive side, actors play quite well, and there is a tiny bit of atmosphere in the movie, but much too little to be any significant.people who vote 10 for this movie either didn't see it, or are member of the movie production team ! 4 is well paid.

i mean, come on! this movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. they also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. it's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.i was really hoping this would be a good movie. there was some good acting. mark hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart, so does sally struthers. it was fun to see them working and succeeding at their craft. majandra delfino was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became untenable. i felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers. brad hunt does an excellent job. he really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies i recently saw, lucky 13. (which was a piece of crap). this guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director.almost forgot! the music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored. i call this kind of music "teller music" because you can just tell what's coming next based on the music. less is more sometimes.cut half of the music from this movie, get a good film editor, a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie.

i went to crooked earth to see a piece of new zealand. what i found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people i know.great moments between characters  including many of temuera morrison and lawrences makoares scenes together  were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through. beautiful and ill-fitting phrases rattled away from lawrence in particular as if he were the new maori messiah at his pulpit of beer crates.when watching any film with maori actors, i've found that i can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. with crooked earth i struggled to find one key character that rung true for the entire two hours. most  including wiremu and peka  wound up saying or doing things that i didn't understand and couldn't connect with. by the end of the movie the writer had succeeded in alienating the audience where the maori weren't able to relate to it and the pakeha were therefore given license to dismiss it. my feeling is that the movies message  or at least the main one of several that was being lobbed at the audience  is important enough to avoid using character extremities. unfortunately, no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to pass this piece of advice on.the soundtrack was invasive, and, as irritating as that horrible `bing-bong' noise that they laced through `eyes wide shut'. the audience was not so subtly auto-cued to laugh, cry or be angry when the music changed. it reminded me of darth vader's entrance music in star wars: obvious and mildly amusing.i think that there are some people out there that might enjoy this film. it's funny in parts, has a fair amount of action and has some really powerful scenes. calvin tuteao and quentin hita did bang up jobs as well. as a whole though, i didn't enjoy the experience as much as i know i should have. barb wire, speed 2, the island of dr moreau and crooked earth look like they're going to be tem's quartet of crap.

i went to see this on the strength of albert finney alone. he's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. i'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to come out! this sends god and the whole human being factory into a crisis and albert finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born. so finney takes the unborn boy for an adventure in the big apple in hopes of showing him all the reasons he should want to live.despite the ridiculousness of the plot, i could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical hollywood sentimental moralistic message film. directorially, the film was rendered unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of the stock sentimental music that hollywood directors seem incapable of resisting.he further butchered the somewhat unconventional story by giving away its hand at every moment. whatever twists and turns were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story unraveled. it was as if the director assumed the audience is just a bunch of idiots who cannot see the obvious hints coming from a mile away.even finney in his performance, though satisfactory, seemed a bit awkward and out of place; and the little boy with curly locks, though he was supposed to be cute, was in fact rather dull. bridget fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate demi moore's performance in 'ghost', shedding tears at a moment's notice.i understand that the film has been unsuccessful thus far at getting distribution in the u.s., which surprises me as i think it has the box office potential to be a modest hit, appealing to both kids and sentimental adults. as far as the quality goes, it's not an awful film, it's just not very good. (4 out of 10)

i went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on vhs. being a big gloria grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. other than that, i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. the plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. ms. grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as i do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot. she works in a dive, so let her use her own voice. it can only lend to the atmosphere. i must agree with an earlier reviewer; the ending borrows heavily from the big heat. to the point of detracting from the ending. i have seen worse films with ms. grahame (macao), but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen. if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. enjoy the picture.

has this ever happened to you? i go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the "film noir" section. i spy a copy of a new arrival of a film i have never seen called naked alibi. its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) "dupey" looking copies of hard to find titles. the description on the box sounds good. the film has players i like (sterling hayden, gloria grahame, and gene barry). so i take it home and watch it. about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts. about half way through this film i started to dislike it. by the time the film ended, i not only disliked it, i despised it. the film opens with cops questioning al willis on suspicion of robbery. other than being drunk, the police have nothing on him. when he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home, the cops beat him up. detective conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating and then announces willis is in the clear. willis swears he will get revenge. later one of the police officers is shot dead. with no evidence other that willis is "sore" about the beating, conroy make willis his sole suspect, despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects. conroy arrests him, but for lack evidence willis is released. the next day two more cops are killed by a bomb. this time conroy goes to the bakery that willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him. conroy doesn't know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of conroy trying strangle willis and conroy is fired. but conroy continues his pursuit and willis flees to mexico where willis has a mistress. conroy manages to convince his mistress (who willis treats rather rough) to help him prove willis is a killer. what this film lacks is a convincing script. the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed. things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it. other than the fact that willis likes to tip a glass now and than, there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife. he treats his wife, his kid and employees well. early in the film, one gets the impression that its conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon. he seems to casually approve of police brutality. conroy, for no reason is convinced from the very start willis has criminal past. he seems to operate on the motto of the old communist bulgarian secret police; "everyone is guilty of something, we just have not found out about it yet." later conroy shows kindness to al's mistress and young son, now we are supposed to like him. sorry! the early impression i got of conroy stuck with me too long. and he is also a dumb cop. only after he is fired and goes to mexico does he run a background check on willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in maryland. why didn't he think of this before? because this film hadn't used up enough running time. the cast is good. gene barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of al willis is. i'm big fan of 40's and 50's crime thrillers but not only did i not think this film was good, it left a bad taste in my mouth (something many modern films do, but older films rarely do).

gordon scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin english has to be the worst of all the tarzans. as for the other actors in this mess, they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. i've seen used car dealers in tv commercials who can act better. they make clayton moore look like laurence olivier! and where does jane (the dull eve brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? i realize these were made for kids but wow! the plot line seemed ok but the director should have required more from his actors. i realize even the weissmuller films have a few flaws but this one seemed so "low budget".

tarzan, the environmental awareness leader, faces four trappers who by most unorthodox means abduct animals to get them to zoos. tarzan has a bland but sexy enough wife with an impeccable hairdo, and a kid. no one should fault tarzan for being grieved by the vicious actions of the hunters.this gordon scott tarzan flick is one of the silliest, completely and unnecessarily silly; for one reason or another, the team did not find anything charming to sustain the movie, and so it's just some silly rubbish. tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil trappers ,because tarzan's environmental awareness brought him into open conflict with the evildoers. the kid and the chimpanzee, both belonging to tarzan, are kidnapped by the malevolent trappers; so tarzan summons the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the kid and the chimpwith tarzan leading the attack. tarzan and the trappers is silly, unappealing, quite uninteresting. maybe as a kid i would have liked it? now one has to be too meanas viciously mean as those pathetic trappers punished by tarzanto ask a tarzan flick not to be silly; this i concede. but one is also truly entitled to ask these tarzan flicks, however silly, to have and to show some gustoa bit of gustoeven a tiny bit of gusto. some kick, some excitement, some fun. now the gordon scott tarzan failure is too silly exactly in the sense of not having any gusto at all, of lacking all excitement. (yes, i liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake. what beast? watch the movie, kiddos, now here i just gave you one excuse to do so.) for one reason or another, the villains look somewhat pathetic and elicit mercy rather than virtuous anger.the books leave the impression that tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or another sportsman to look clever enough for the role might prove a too demanding, next to impossible task, gordon scott was anyway too far from meeting that ideal.the wife chides tarzan for disliking books.the script suggests tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate, and adverse to learning; but the book says otherwise, and we know that tarzan studied much, by himself, using the books of his gone family, before even meeting white people.and i did not like that yell.(it's supposed, dear kiddos, to be a genuine wild yell, not a missed yodeler.)

gordon scott made some good tarzan movies, but this is not one of them.as i watched it, wincing at the bad, obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden "clonking" sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails, and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast, i kept thinking, "sheesh! this is tv show level!" then i find out it was, indeed, three tv show pilot episodes woven seam-fully into one.it's nice to see scott get outside (alone), away from the lame sets, in a few of the scenes; and the fights do have some pretty nice moves... but oh, ow, and ouch as to the dialog. and did i mention the acting? heck, cheetah (or "cheta," in this version) was a better actor than most of the humans.and that's not saying much.it is kind of a stitch to see a younger sherman (i.e. scatman) carothers acting as a native. but probably not worth the overall time-investment.

this is not exactly what i would call a mad max film, after seeing road warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film, i felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. it supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the mad max franchise(bad idea). the casting was not exactly the best, i mean come on tina turner? one of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. no wez, no humungus, not even a decent toecutter! nothing really even happens, if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick (can it even be called that?) make sure you see mad max 2 or mad max, or better yet both. another problem with this film is that there are too many people, even the thunderdome battle sequence is dull, max doesn't even kill anyone! the music is bad, the characters are bad (not in the good way) and after seeing this film, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.

i feel terribly sorry! where the lubitsch-pic was enchanting, marvelous, full of spirit and elegance, this one here is only - colored! lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie. think of jeanette mcdonald, who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by "playing" with count danilo. that lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! she only sings one song - the title role of an lehar-operetta, that is really funny! the only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end: glamorous! and - after watching this scene - have a look at the introducing waltz scene in "gentlemen prefer blondes"! any similarities?

my wife and i met doing a professional production of "the merry widow" in 1982 -- in english, but a straight translation.only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this "adaptation". most of the characters have been deleted, along with the entire b plot, and all but one of the characters remaining have been renamed. most of the characters in the movie aren't in the operetta, either. the action has been moved from paris to, at first, washington, dc, and then to the fictional country of pontevedro, which the movie has renamed "marshovia", and only later to paris. the net result is that we don't reach the beginning of the original play until about 45 minutes in.and the main source of tension in the plot is deleted, too. in the original, years before, count danilo and the heroine were very much in love, but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor; it's his broken heart that has rendered him a careless playboy. now that, as a widow, she's the richest woman in the world, she still loves him, and he still loves her, but his pride won't let him admit it to anyone, even himself, and she must spend three acts playing mind games to break him down. the trope of the aristocrat with money problems who won't admit that he's in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think supplied the main plots of a substantial fraction of viennese operettas for decades after the 1906 "widow". in this movie, they've never met before, which rips out not only the heart of the whole thing, but nearly all the comedy.lamas does a pretty decent job, though.an interesting musical point is that several times we hear a snippet or so of "trés parisien", an extra song written (in english, despite the title) for the london première, which was not, as far as i know, usually found in american productions until the 1980s or so.

okay. i really tried to tap into the (so called) silly & surreal humor that this film sets out to be. i'm told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to america (go figure!), and has less political references. apart from all that, i found this sexual/political farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn. the central female lead is easy on the eyes, and could actually act. i would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no,not the ones you're thinking of). it's obvious that japan can (and does)produce just as much crap as other countries. i couldn't recommend this to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone who has a jones for asian porn. go see a real japanese film.

it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a north korean spy, but survives. the bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of george w. bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater. i'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in new york this past april, but i sincerely hope not many. it sounds like a light and playful pinku flick, but it has art-house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring. many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but this film's aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating. and then the sex scenes aren't even good! i've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty japanese movies. i've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull. the spice channel is more imaginative. the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress, emi kuroda. otherwise, this is pure torture.

ed gein: the butcher of plainfield is set in the small american town of plainfield in wisconsin during 1957 where loner ed gein (kane hodder) lives by himself on a farm after the death if his mother & brother. the local police have had a spate of grave robberies to deal with & when local barmaid sue layton (ceia coley) suspicions grow that something nasty is going on. ed is a violent sexually deviant man who kidnaps girls & murders them, will the police figure the truth out in time to save erica (adrienne frantz) the sheriff's (timothy oman) daughter...written, produced & directed by michael feifer this was an attempt to base a horror film around the true events surrounding notorious serial killer ed gein & turns out to be pretty crap. the real life ed gein was only ever convicted of two murders & died in 1984 but several films have been inspired by him including the texas chainsaw massacre (1974), deranged (1974) & ed gein (2000) with this fairly recent addition possibly being the worst gein film ever. even though ed gein was real next to nothing in this film is based on fact, gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers, there was no car crash victim, although gein keeps his name other people have had name changes, the kidnapping & murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years apart in reality but in this film it happens over the course of a couple of days & while here gein is shown as a large hulking muscular man in reality he was a scrawny, thin, old & quite short. as a factual drama ed gein: the butcher of plainfield is worthless & as pure entertainment it's no better with a deadly dull pace & feel to it, the character's are all boring & when he isn't killing someone gein is shown working or just walking around & it's very dull. there's no suspense because we know who the killer is & it's just a tedious wait until he gets caught at the end. there is no real attempt to get into gein's mind with the makers giving him no more motivation than him occasionally having hallucinations of his domineering mother.there isn't much gore here, there's a scene with a woman hanging on a meat-hook, there's a really badly edited scene of gein cutting a leg off, there's the usual jars of bodily organs & skulls lying around as well as a bit of blood but there's really not much here to get excited about. the film was obviously processed to bleach a lot of the colour out of the picture as it's not far off black and white at times, i personally think the lack of colour makes it even duller to sit through.with a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 i can't really see where the money went in a very forgettable production. although set in wisconsin this was filmed in california. kane hodder is all wrong for the role of ed gein, just from a physical point of view hodder doesn't look even remotely like gein & he gives a pretty poor performance to as he just stares at the camera a lot making silly faces.ed gein: the butcher of plainfield is crap & it's as simple & straightforward as that. as either a factual drama or pure exploitation entertainment this is total tripe from start to finish with nothing to recommend it.

the most disposable movie in the history of cinema?this one is a strong contender!why wasting so much money for such a pointless useless work? the only difference between the hitchcock classic and this poor imitation is color,wide screen and leila's walkman!!a movie which's supposed to generate thrills and fear leaves me completely indifferent.no you' re going to tell me it will urge the young generations to see the original?balderdash!this "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler.they could have done something different,for instance ,by casting an actor closer to bloch 's bates ,an obese man.they content themselves with an obnoxious rehash!a pox on it!and long live alfred hitchcock!

well, i have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said "leave it alone." why they had to make this re-make of the 1960 "psycho," i don't know. my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern-day actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. the dialog was the same and the story the same.on one hand, i applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film. yet, if they were going to keep everything the same, why bother when you weren't going to improve on tony perkins, janet leigh and the original cast?did they honestly think vince vaughn was going to be as good or better than perkins? are you kidding? ann heche, with her short mannish-haircut, is going to be better than leigh? i don't think so!yes, the colors were pretty in here but it's the black-and-white photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with. it's perfect for the story, not a bunch of greens and pinks! once again, i guess the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the original.this was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground.

i know that the original psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, especially a shot-by-shot remake. i think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. but there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.the first problem is the color. the original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot after color film had been invented. the choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of hitchcock's. now, this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this movie are all too wrong. the most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, particularly on marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character. the bright colors make it look like a happy movie and, when horrific events take place in these color schemes, it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream.the second problem is the lighting. this is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting, but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the opposite direction. most of the scenes are very brightly lit, even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at night!another obvious problem is vince vaughn's performance. yes, he does pull off norman bate's awkwardness and madness quite well, i don't deny him that. but there is one element to the character that he failed to show: the softness. there should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character, at least at first, which then fades away once we realize the truth about him. beyond being a character trait of norman bates, this is a recognized character trait of all psychopaths!!!!there are a few good aspects of this film. some of the performances are great. as i said, vince vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of norman bates. viggo mortensen and juliane moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. anne heche may have been atrocious but, unlike janet leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film, anne heche was given last billing in the opening credits.i read on the cover of a copy of the psycho novel that gus van sant claimed this was not a remake of the hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. i now wish that i had bought that book and saved the comment because, after seeing this film, that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing i have ever seen. there was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original, and it would be far more believable if van sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet zafroomulax. so many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way. such as the scene in which sam and lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow. hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances, not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.in other words, my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said. like everyone else here, i reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original.

hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of, but also the 'look' of anthony perkins. he projected a kind of clean-cut innocence: a young teen-idol type of persona. he was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like, especially in the 50's when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. which is exactly why the casting of him as norman bates was a slice of true hitchcockian genius. audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly.that's why this re-make does not work, even a little bit, in spite of trying to be an exact copy. whereas anthony perkins looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer, vince vaughn is easily imaginable as one. he lacks the frail look of perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well, at least in this role (honestly - has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as anthony perkins?). while it was a pointless re-make to begin with, the miscasting of the story's most important character sucks this film down completely.as a side note, i feel that hollywood's propensity for re-making great movies because 'young' people refuse to watch anything that's not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work. as for viewers who can't watch black and white - it's their loss. hopefully they'll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention. when they do they'll discover that sometimes black and white works far better. with the background muted, the story and performances are that much more front and center. and in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not attainable in colour.

no matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. if the film was a re-working or, as in planet of the apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original. imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the 'mona lisa', posed her in a different way, and painted her you could only compare the framing,concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally.that said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work.the degrading aspects of this picture were vince vaughn and anne heche. it's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it's that the relationship between norman and marion in the original was really quite innocent, norman didn't really understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to her,this makes norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'mother'. in the remake that whole dynamic is gone, i must admit to janet leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, anne heche is really unattractive and so norman finding 'her' marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to vince vaughn's norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like, who you feel absolutely no sympathy for, they further destroy norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room. it destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for, it's like re-making 'it's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading.the only other character that i had problems with was rita wilson as caroline, marion's workmate. in the original when pat hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding ring' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself, when rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would flirt with anne heche over her.i'll admit that i am very biased, the original 'psycho' is my favorite film of all time, had the film been a reworking, with a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable.hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. this also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de-sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. (n.b before people think 'he can't spell' remember i'm from england and we spell it colour)a remake should be just that, re made, this is a forgery, a complete copy and a very bad one at that. i could go on comparing but there is no point, almost everything is superior in the original. the only one thing that is better is the performance of viggo mortensen as sam loomis, john gavin was very flat in the original (hitch called him 'the stiff' behind his back) and mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance. william h. macy and julianne moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals.overall a movie that should be labeled 'expensive embarrassing failed experiment. only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you. but view original too' the movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0.5 out of 5 (for macy, moore and mortensen)

i know curiosity killed the cat, but i simply had to see the remake of psycho, especially after being on such a hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work. i've watched the original psycho though since i was a kid, i knew how to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent movie! one of the best, in fact! the first thing i said when i heard about the remake was "how do you remake perfection?". i stuck to that as well, but i think i have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing psycho to a new generation.but this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original psycho. i know this has been said, but i watched the making of this film, and the director was like "oh, i just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original"... what's the friggin' point?! ok, but i want to judge this movie on it's own, despite it's insulting blows the original. i mean, the acting wasn't up to par, but honestly, it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy own.watching the making of this film, i wanted to slap anne hasche, she said "i've never seen the original, i just wanted to work with gus." ooh, that made me angry, because frankly, it's not just that, she really sucked in this role as marian, she wasn't convincing, not to mention her shower scene really was horrible. vince vaughn didn't make... let's just put it this way, the film was horribly miscasted. this was a sin against film and on it's own, this was actually a bad movie. it was too much and destroyed what could've been a new introduction for a new generation. but to gus, leave the film making the one's who know what they're doing!1/10

this is, per se, an above average film but why in the name of bog was it made? it's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an alfred hitchcock classic of 1960. you can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.what does the word "credit" mean? how can we credit van sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets, and color?anne heche is attractive but lacks janet leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman. and heche is younger than leigh, who brought to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down, the desperation of a woman facing forty. and heche doesn't project anxiety the way leigh did. the scene with the chp officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role. in the original, the officer asks, "is there something wrong?" leigh: "of course not. am i acting as if something were wrong?" the officer hesitates before replying: "well, frankly, yes." that exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that heche isn't nervous enough.the worst change, without a doubt, is the substitution of vince vaughn for anthony perkins. it may not be vaughn's fault. who could match perkins in the role? perkins is twitchy, bird-like, long-necked, cloaked in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum. his every move (eating candy corn, with his adam's apple bobbing) and every utterance, the faint laugh, the arid chuckle, is spot on. he just can't be improved upon. vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short-haired beefy guy who was just discharged as a lance corporal from the u. s. army. to suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal norman in speech and manner. (unlike the original norman, vaughn doesn't even stumble over the word "fallacy" because it resembles "phallus".) he could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to ucla.the direction deserves a few comments. i don't see what it adds to the story when we see norman masturbating while peeping in on anne heche. i don't object to it. i wonder why it's there, just as i wonder why the rest of the movie is there.and, i suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience, van sant seems to have missed a bit of hitchcock's more subtle stuff. heche is given underwear of all different colors -- green, pink, orange, and -- mango? is that a color? if so, what the hell color is it? never mind. the point is that in the original, when the traveling camera first peeks through the window of the phoenix hotel it captures janet leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra. later, after she has stolen the money, we see her in her underwear again -- this time both her slip and bra are black. tis a small thing, but hitch's own.at that, the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the black-and-white shooting of the original was superb. the color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary, dull, and subliminally ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the seedier part of las vegas.most of all, the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one. i can remember seeing it in a drive-in in san diego and staring aghast at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually dead -- half-way through the movie! nothing like it had ever been done before.that murder in the shower, in both movies, was a big improvement over robert bloch's original novel, by the way, in which the author writes something like, "the murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife." i'm not making that up. well, not entirely. even here, van sant's movie gives us excess. there is more blood and more bare flesh. and where hitchcock closed in first on the blood circling the bathtub drain and dissolved to marian's blankly open eye, then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face, he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the proper vertical, giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder, but a dizzying disbelief. van sant doesn't tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as hitchcock did. he practically twirls it on its axis.it won't do to call this a bow to hitchcock because it's not. it's a pecuniary plundering of hitchcock's material (already ripped off in "psycho" i, ii, iii, iv, and "psycho: the beginning years", and "come into my parlor: mrs. bates' revenge," and "hand me that knife, would you?: the true story of norman bates.") a rehashing of and grinding away at truly original stuff, a crumenal act if not a criminal one. and that's not to mention the many homages in other films, especially the french, such as the notorious "ocean of boredom" scenes between marcel brulee and jeanne gateau in the much-admired "la mere de la nuit." (maybe i'd better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. and when a chicken's guts grind corn, it's a "crumenal" act. i won't go on except to say these gags, shabby as they are, are more fun than the movie.)so who was it made for? i'd have to guess. kids who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white? kids who are hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie? chimpanzees?

yes, why? among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's gus van sant is one of my idols. there are others, a few. steven sodebergh, pt anderson, tim hunter, danny boyle, martin donovan, harmony korine, wes anderson. idiosyncratic, infuriating some times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. their names make me switch on the tv, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. van sant's "psycho" however, gives me pause. why? i wonder. a shot by shot massacre of one of the perennial classics. the color was jarring, the performances, atrocious. what was vince vaughn doing? was it a parody? a bad joke? what the hell was it? anne heche as janet leigh? who dressed her? viggo mortensen with a cowboy hat. viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldn't make us forget john gavin and if julianne moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldn't have been any "the hours" for her, "the minutes" maybe. so, here i am, bad mouthing the work of one of my idols. the crashing question remains: why, mr. van sant? maybe, in the words of president clinton, because he could. i'm afraid that's no excuse.

at least the jingle by tim finn was melodic. roberts is the his usual inept self. characters are inconsistent, dull, purposeless. roberts changes his accent even within one line.

this movie really starts strong. we know that roberts is an atlanta hotshot sent to australia to fix coke's marketing problems. we also know he is an eccentric genius. roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.usually, i am a sucker for bold and far out plots. examples which i am fond of include, "dark star," "o.c. & stiggs," and "popeye." coupled with the fact that i must admit that this film was well acted, it surprises even myself that i cannot recommend this film.the utter breakdown in this movie occurs about midway through the film. all comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark. afterwards, the film plods along. the film's attempt to get the comedy rolling again is not successful. more surprises await the viewer and they are darker still.to be sure, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. however, with this movie, the result is about as successful as "new coke."

i have watched this movie quite bemused. i am not sure whether it was attempting to be a horror gore fest in a rob zombie type affair or an exploration of real events.in either case it missed its mark. it's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story. the performances were neither compelling nor bad.for me, i would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have gone down this route without spoiling the overall effect.

you can't really blame the movie maker for glorifying che because the industry is all about money. most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist cuban government after che's death. che was a murdering scumbag from day one. here's a list of the great things che did for cuba 1) executed thousands of innocent cuban men, women, and children to satisfy his lust for power.2) destroyed cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. the cuban peso used to be equal with the american dollar. now it's basically worthless.3) continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy, economy, and the military. he never made it past his first year in medical school, and he was only in one real battle, in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun.4) he took over the largest estate in cuba to set up for himself. he had a yacht, a 60" custom made tv from america, a swimming pool, and a view of the ocean. so much for shunning the materialist life style.cuba today is an absolutely destitute country, and you have no one but che and the castro brothers to thank for it. if you go to cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas. if you did manage to get out of what you're meant to see, you would find slums, beggars, and prostitutes.if you think any of what i'm saying is untrue then go do some studying. compare cuban exports from 1950/60 to those of today; talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called cuban "revolution" of the 1960's; read all of the reports of murdered innocents; read the reports from people who served under che and castro and fled because of what an evil, disgusting human being he was.and please, please, always remember to read or watch everything objectively. stop taking everything at face value and think about it.

che! is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film. it takes a serious subject and presents it like the cliff notes version or classic comics because there isn't much emotion or a proper narrative--just episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid "true stories" relayed by a variety of yutzes.this is a deservedly derided film, as it is poorly written and acted. however, what i have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext. instead of che guevarra and fidel castro working towards a communist cuba, they seem to be more of a gay couple--with che behaving coy and aloof and fidel as the ardent suitor! again and again, the film abounds with great lines such as when fidel implores che "cuba needs you....i need you!!". i am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent, but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to recognize it! i am very surprised that the other reviewers didn't point this out. however, if you remember this when you watch the film, it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnier.a final note. in recent years, che has been very chic--even a fashion statement with hoards of brain-dead teens, who have no idea who he was, wearing shirts emblazoned with his face. considering he was a cold-blooded killer and nihilist (an odd combination for a doctor), this new reverence for the man is gross. what will they do next, put hitler or dr. mengele on t-shirts and posters?!!? even communists with consciences should be appalled by the bloodshed guevara was responsible for and i find it ironic that people with computers are championing a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance! considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was, it does nothing to further the message that guevara was no hero. i would love to see a realistic film done of his life--with the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that weren't apparently created by chimps!

the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. when sharif or, please god, palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug. the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean, and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass. what does that leave us with? one comical dentistry scene; a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro's manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio. never trust a medved, but even a busted clock is right twice a day: this is a historically awful movie.

35 years after this was made, castro still reigns. unfortunately, we're left scratching our heads wondering how the dim-witted maniac played by scenery-chewing jack palance made it as far as 1960. i stumbled back across this recently, and was amused at noticing the incomparable sid haig and "b" movie favorite paul (untouchables) picerni among the rebels. fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness. some of the lines are classic in a "did he really say that kind of way?' the other thing i just noticed is that the score and the sound (not the dialog) are actually excellent -- the only first-rate elements of the entire production. so, don't watch this to learn anything about history or acting, but if you feel like watching this as a goof, bring the beers and have some fun.

if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of che guevara, the cuban revolutionary who helped aid fidel castro in his bid for power, you'd better read up on cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine (you are on the internet, after all).but whatever you do, do not watch "che!". unless, of course, you just want a good laugh.all the reviewers of the time (and moviegoers) gave "che!" their vote for worst film of the decade. and no wonder; have you seen this travesty? its facts are tenuous at best, sharif is even unconvincing as a corpse and as for palance's fidel catsro imitation.... like i said, if you want a good laugh.it's like watching a co-production between the learning channel and mad magazine.one star. i wonder if palance can do w. c. fields, too?

with a catchy title like the butcher of plainfield this ed gein variation and kane hodder playing him will no doubt fly off the shelves for a couple of weeks.most viewers will be bored silly with this latest take on the life of ed gien.the movie focuses on ed's rampage and gives us a(few)glimpses into his psycosis and dwelling in plainfeild.its these scenes that give the movie a much needed jolt.what ruins this is the constant focus on other characters lives and focuses less on eds.big mistake here.kane hodder is a strange choice to play gein,but he does pull it off quite well,and deserves more acting credits than he gets these days.prascilla barnes and micahel barryman also show up.3/10

there are many reasons i'm not a fan of fact based films, but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story. if they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original? otherwise stick to the facts. this could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that. ed gein was an insanely frightening human being. it's been said if you were to take michael myers, jason voorhees and leatherface, wrap them into one person, ed gein would still be sicker/scarier. so why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this? when will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction? i've read books and watched news programs about him and, now i'm not a screenwriter or anything, but i believe there's enough documentation on gein that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented. i'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy's relationship with his mother, and girlfriend as filler, and far too much of it.i guess what i'm wondering is this... why at the end of the movie did i know more about the supporting characters than i did about ed gein? why didn't we get to know his mother, father and brother and the relationships between them... what made him the psychopath he was... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became? instead, the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy... running.in the end i give it 4/10 stars. thats 2 for the gore and 2 for kane hodder. even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion, considering gein was a smallish man, and possibly effeminate and hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what i would consider feminine. maybe i was just excited because he was jason voorhees.

i, like many folks, believe the 1989 epic lonesome dove was one of the best westerns ever produced, maybe the best. and, realizing that most sequels (in this case a prequel) are certain to disappoint, my expectations were low. comanche moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting, poor casting and frankly, a lousy script. lonesome dove created western heroes of captains mccrae and call due to incredibly strong performances by robert duvall and tommy lee jones. prior to living in lonesome dove, we believed they bravely fought to rid texas of bandits and savage indians during their rangering years. if i had only seen comanche moon, i would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent, cowardly idiots. in lonesome dove, call and mccrae supposedly chased blue duck all over texas and never managed to capture or kill him. in comanche moon, a shot to call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. there wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries. the best punch was mccrea sucker punching inez scull, a funny scene but out of character for mccrae.where was mccrae's wit and charm? clara's love for mccrae, a drunken, unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible. and maggie's love for call, a dispassionate and sullen loner, defies logic. the cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. credit goes not only to hd technology, but the cinematographer. the comanche moon miniseries was better than anything else on tv for three nights, but sadly that's not saying much.

this is a really bad waste of your time. i would probably rather go watch some documentary than this; it's really that bad.the acting is really terrible, and you can tell that the producers had a low budget because of the terrible picture quality. it's by far on the low end of the scale; don't waste your money on it.i have a really hard time believing the person who made this movie that it would fare well. i had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids. even the kids (3, 4, 6, and 8) all thought it was pretty boring.i agree with the other commenter, spongebob would be a lot better to watch than this.overall: just don't watch it. don't. don't.

dear mr. seitzman, or whomever i may hold responsible for mr. seitzman not meeting his rightful fate of being eaten alive by rabid wolverines;i do not know you, and so cannot comment on your character; for all i know, you give to charities and help little old ladies cross the street. still, i must insist, for the common good, that you never write another screenplay as long as you live. put down the pen, step away from the laptop! if you refuse to heed the pleading of wounded brains, i have watched a movie or two in my life, and i believe you will find my counsel helpful: 1. do not include love scenes in which overwrought teenage boys name the body parts of their girlfriends after us states. if you must pen such a scene, please do not name the breasts "new york" and "new jersey"; it causes unnecessary speculation as to which cities occupy the nipples. also, it is almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying.2. do not rely solely on john hughes movies in order to reinforce class distinctions.3. do not bludgeon the audience over the head with exhausted clichés. yes, yes, kelley and sam stand out in the rain, and it cleanses them of their cares. we get it. yes, the roses continue to bloom in kelley's dead mother's greenhouse, even though every other plant has begun to rot. it is a symbol of their love. it is also very painful when applied via blunt-force trauma to the backs of our heads. for the love of god, mr. seitzman, we get it. we all get it, all across the land. amish people, the hard of hearing, unborn babies - we all get it.4. do not require the actors to perform mime sequences. ever. no, never.5. did i mention that you should ease up on the trite symbolism? because the audience can draw the parallel between the rebuilding of the restaurant and the building of the relationship between kelley and sam without any help. truly. we get it.6. go through your script, and cull out the following lines, and any lines resembling them: "i don't know what we are anymore." "i don't want to lose you." "he's just like the rest of them!" (and its corollary, "daddy, you don't even know him!") 7. yes, yes, she's in heaven, running around in a field. we get it.8. and in other news, we get it.i have seen dozens of terrible movies in my life; i never expected to suffer for your art, and i would have just left the theater, but an elephant with the words "doomed love" painted on its side fell from the sky and pinned me to my seat.in closing, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars, and i hate you.

**** possible spoiler **** if you were making a serious movie involving a powerful, but aging father with three apparently ungrateful daughters, featuring actors of the highest caliber, with great cinematography and a beautiful midwestern setting, now where would you go with it? why, you'd fashion a modern tragedy after "king lear" of course.that's what i was expecting. that certainly wasn't what i got. what i got was 105 minutes of feminist tripe--one long harangue about man's inhumanity to woman. why, there wasn't a decent male in the entire story.you see early on where this film might be headed, but you can't believe anyone would waste all these fine actors and craftsmen on that trite scenario--you just want them to get on with the king lear theme. but it never happens; and there's the real tragedy if you ask me.aside from the panorama of glorious rural heartland, about the only thing worth watching in this film was that wonderful chameleon, british actor colin firth, practicing his midwestern accent. now there was a treat.3/10

the story is derived from "king lear"; the setting is a farm in iowa. here's a test for this kind of thing: if you find yourself asking, "why did so-and-so do such-and-such," and the answer is, "because that's what happened in 'king lear'," you know that the film has failed. well, that is what happens here. the father figure in this story isn't living his own life, he's mimicking a fictional one. but there's more wrong with the film than this.jocelyn moorhouse is ambitious - far more ambitious than i think she realises. she's trying to take the king lear story and completely change the setting. this is a task in itself. the likeliest result is that the transplanted story will die, and nobody will quite be able to work out why (although there are enough successful transplants, like "west side story", to make it worth trying). but she's also attempting a revisionist retelling. in the version of "king lear" she wishes to create, reagan and goneril command our sympathy, and cordelia is a villain. this is a task in itself, too.succeeding at either task is hard; succeeding at both at once is impossible. in fact, succeeding at one while so much as attempting the other, is impossible. if we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must be the very same events - which means there can be no tampering with setting. if the story is to be transplanted, alive, into a different setting, its moral heart must keep beating the whole while - which means there can be no tampering with ethical perspective. moorhouse was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her endeavours. and so she did. ...naturally, it's possible to attempt both tasks, fail at both tasks, yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art that's good for independent reasons. i mention this because i haven't read jane smiley's novel, which, for all i know, is good for independent reasons. but the film isn't. if there was nothing else wrong with it, there would still be no getting around the fact that it's just so thoroughly, excruciatingly dull. the very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life - which needn't be the case, since off the top of my head i can think of four films ("the wizard of oz", "north by northwest", "the straight story", "kikujiro") in which the cornfields aren't boring at all.

this movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion. there are some good performances, but the subplots are extraneous and largely unresolved.in addition, i found all the characters unlikeable, and if you can't identify with at least one character, there isn't much to get excited about. all in all, this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little.

sadly a great opportunity to utilise a superb cast to bring king lear up to date. however, instead, we got a contrived family drama that appeared to dip into lear when the writer had run out of ideas, the cast worked hard but it just didn't gel. recently stephen harrigan showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent tv movie "king of texas".

it's probably a cultural thing---somehow, the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this stuff funny. i have experienced this phenomenon first-hand, during an open-air cinema event, where this film was shown before the feature. most of the indigenous audience laughed, and no, this wasn't in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children, this was in a well-to-do area, and the audience consisted mostly of educated adults.so it must be possible, somehow, to find this amusing, but honest to goodness, i have no idea what it takes---maybe it's in the air or the water, prolonged exposure to which causes this condition. something must cause it, obviously, the only thing i can say is that i am quite sure what doesn't cause it: the movie itself.there are no jokes in it. it's brain dead, stupid, nonsensical, unfunny, lame. it's, in short, a waste of time. any tom and jerry is funnier, heck even funerals are funnier.just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the stooges' performances: it's three guys behaving, running, even talking like retarded infants, causing all kinds of unfunny mayhem, with no plot, no real purpose, and no real conclusion. it's like ugly teletubbies without the cute costumes.sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite exasperating, because you feel like you are at a party with a bunch of potheads and you are the only one who hasn't smoked anything.so unless you are prepared to intoxicate yourself to make this bearable, or come equipped with whatever it is that makes people think watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny, my advice on this is: stay way. far away.

i saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996. i remember i was already familiar with elijah wood's work (that's right, he made stuff before "lord of the rings"!) and the merchandising tie-ins to the film were pretty abundant ("flipper" water guns were even circulating).adults were reminded of the old movies and tv show and for nostalgia's sake took their kids to see it, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy.unfortunately it wasn't what anyone expected and flopped severely. you know a movie's in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away, and the kid -- instead of getting out of the water into a boat -- floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he hasn't taken into mind that the shark is still out there, perhaps even below him.another problem is paul hogan. he looks old, crusty and tired of recycling his croc dundee shtick. by now, no one even remembered "crocodile dundee" much less hogan, and i half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish-out-of-water/social-satire laughs.all in all this is a really poor "family" movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times. i hated it when i saw it in theaters back in '96 and i hate it more now.

my take: even splendid underwater photography can salvage a familiar script and paper-thin characters. for those who haven't already got enough of the free willy pictures, flipper might serve up a decent rental. others are (heavily) suggested to stay away. although flipper is harmless affair, it hardly showcases anything for the adult audience (unless it's your first time to see a dolphin).a remake of a 1960's tv show and film, flipper may have sound like a good idea back then: a dolphin charms the life of boy and a girl, they help ave the environment by first getting rid of toxic wastes thrown in on the sparkling waters of the florida keys, and at the same time, battle a shark and a salty sea baddie who happens to be the one responsible for the toxic dumping and also happens to hate dolphins. but even for the 90's, especially if an eerily similar film like free willy was a recent hit, flipper is just another harmless yet occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids. although the animals (this, in case, is the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead shark, typecast as the villain) and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show, there's nothing much in flipper to steal from anyway.the story is completely predictable, something than nowadays even a 6-year old may find evident. the (human) cast, led by a pre-lord of the rings elijah wood and an out-of-work paul hogan, have rarely anything to do but stand around and look pretty. their acting skills, whatever they may be to this movie, is rarely revealed on screen, unless you consider the "acting" talents of cheerful bottlenose dolphin. i guess not trying to recommend flipper as mindless family entertainment won't be fair, but anyone over the age of 10 (no, make that 8), are better off renting or buying something else. besides, the film is about 95 minutes tops. that might just give you enough time to something elsewhere without worrying about your kids. that alone might be worth the rental.rating: ** out of 5.

reading the other user comments, the review by a666333 has articulated most of what i was feeling throughout this film- predictable storyline, cliché versions of lesbians/heterosexuals (i.e. straight woman becomes a lesbian while concluding that her husband is abusive and aggressive). also, the score was severely disappointing. it was bland, soft, sentimental elevator music- another common cliché in movies about lesbians. the movie would have had a few interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music.a few scenes concerning sex and eroticism also struck me as attempts to titillate and raise shock value, including parts of the final performance scene. the conventional "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as the overly sentimental score. for example during the pool scene, the women are kissing, and then the camera pans along the abandoned wine glass, the flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft crashing of waves.the only elements i liked were the costuming and arobatics. they are well-choreographed, and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes. i genuinely smiled during those, and during the last scene with the police officer. but they were not enough to balance out the negatives or make me enjoy this film.

i have not watched every jackass episode. it was mildly entertaining if nothing else was going. but after watching jackass #2 i was fond of bam and dunn. they had a nice attitude in the movie jackass so i figured i'd tune in on viva la bam. boy was i mistaken. seriously, you could pair a bunch of 2'graders, provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen. i mean, c'mon mtv!! at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish.everything seems so forced. you don't know the characters because there's no attitude at all. you can't appreciate bam or dunn, or anyone for that matter. if there would just be a tiny tiny doze of thought. anything we won't forget as soon as next shot goes on.they finally manage to create a good shot and you like whats going on. you sit there, just waiting for their reaction, and then some jerk closes the scenes with two lame sentences and bang. was that the close for that shot or what, please?. if i had been there i would freak out and laugh. do some insane stuff and have my adrenaline pumping but these guys... just scripted stupid reactions.yes they get a few chuckles of the audience by cheap gross jokes, or gigantic jokes which in my opinion are such a waste of cash. many many normal humans which was not taken under the jackass wing could in a heartbeat write a far funnier script. or impress with visual camera work. even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would pull of a better job. mtv could in a whim bring more soothing material on the screen. you just need to fire the writer of this stupid show.some scenes actually require a bit of courage and therefore 2 stars.

viva la bam this "jackass" spin off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of bam margera and his pals (johnny knoxville, brandon dicamillo, etc). this show, while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on bam's torturing of his parents.i'm sorry to say this, bam, but... you're in no way as cool as you think you are. this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, i liked jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he's going to do "whatever the f***" he wants to. how about you do something that is actually funny? i liked "jackass" for what it was worth. the camera-work was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed.not so with "viva la bam". we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining, but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile."viva la bam" is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed margera's already too big ego. i don't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.

bam margera of the jackass fame is back with his own reality show, and not only is it not as funny as jackass, but it's also amazingly stupider! this has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived. sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb.bam margera has made it big, and his parents decided to piggy bank off of his fame. bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends all live together, and while bam and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into mischief, generally his parents are at home being stupid. when bam's parents aren't at home being lazy, they're being tortured by bam, especially his father. to add to the humor, we are treated to his fat uncle don vitto who is constantly out of it, and never paying attention.this show really is like a toned down version of jackass...toned down in that there aren't stunts, instead bam and his buddies just go break stuff, and do lame stunts, and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome. this is not funny in the least. i can't imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here.if you are a big fan of bam margera, and want to see one of the many follow up/cash-in sequels to the jackass series.my rating: * out of ****. 30 mins. tv14

anyone remember the first cky, cky2k etc..? back when it was about making crazy cool stuff, rather than watching bam margera act like a douchebag, spoiled 5 year old, super/rock-star wannabe.the show used to be awesome, however, bam's fame and wealth has led him to believe, that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic, more than actual cool stuff, that used to be in ex. cky2k.the acts are so repetitive, there's like nothing new, except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments... the only things we see is bam margera, so busy showing us how much he doesn't care, how much money he got or whatsoever.i really got nothing much left to say except, give us back cky2k, cause bam suck..i enjoy watching steve-o, knoxville etc. a thousand times more.

this is by far the worst and most stupid show i have ever seen on tv. it is almost physically painful to watch an adult (well in his twenties) doing nothing but torture and mock his parents, who always seem to have no clue what so ever about the stunts they are forced to endure by their dimwitted son and his equally stupid friends. of course i know his parents are in on it, but i really hate how they always act like they are caught completely by surprise. it seems fake through and through. and i really hate the intro of the show, in which a voice over asks "bam margera, what will he think of next?!?!" (i think that's how it is, anyway), and bam himself answers: "whatever the f^*k i want!" - wow! bam is really a hell raiser - living at home with mum and dad! -of course the word "f^*k" is replaced with a tasteful beep, but we get the message. bam is the real deal rebel - at least in his own eyes. of course bam and his posse of numb sculls aim at an audience of teenage boys, and of course it's a mtv show, but please, raise the bar a little. it's painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.

overall i'd call this a disappointing performance. it attempts the old "horror anthology" approach, but fails miserably. the acting was bad, and so were the stories. any skin shown in the movie was obviously random, just to attract the r-rating for sex. typical, i guess, but bad nonetheless. take your $5 and rent a real movie instead!

okay, so the movie went straight to video. if i had paid to see this, i would've been disappointed. but, at 2 am in the morning, alone at night, it's a pretty good fright! (hey, that rhymes!)

i used to work at the company that originally put out this film, vestron pictures. vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had, they didn't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films. not that money alone will buy you a good film. look at kevin costner's waterworld, for instance.sometimes, if you have a talented person in-house doing the acquisitions or development, you can create your own new talent. but at vestron, there wasn't such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area. in this case, it was on the director and the writer. which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the great ensemble cast this film has.i think the basic premise of this movie was "let's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens." it's an intriguing idea, but not worth your time watching.most vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them. my wife and i developed the ability to spot this quality even in non-vestron films. many times, we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or tv ad. we'd sit there, watching the trailer or ad, and afterwards, we'd turn to each, and almost in sync, we'd say, "now that's a vestron movie!" this is a vestron movie.

a root canal without anesthesia is more amusing. this movie is disturbing and pointless. there is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line. what in god's name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie? the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty damn good. "the in-laws" is a funny movie. "the birdcage" is a hilarious movie. "the big lebowski" is a humorous movie. this movie is just dumb. i cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to write the "novel" that this movie is based on. i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie. it just doesn't make any sense. people please - i beg of you - do not see this movie. you will regret it for the rest of your life. this movie is not the worst ever made, but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list.

i really liked this quirky movie. the characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv. it has a realistic edge, with a captivating story line. the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch.

while i was watching this movie i never thought i'd be defending it. it's honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot. there's no real characters to latch onto except the killer. some of the acting can be better, but most of it is capable.i know, a three out of ten isn't stellar, but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless, etc. i think it set out to do what it's supposed to fairly well. the lighting is minimal at times, more natural than most audiences are used to, but it's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film. in fact, at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that, but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work that's truly that bad.it's not particularly scary, but it is disturbing at times. there are one or two characters who don't come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times, but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies.

kill the scream queen may sound like a good slasher flick but it is terribly boring and very dumb.kill the scream queen is about a crazy filmmaker who auditions girls to be in his snuff film. he rapes and tortures them. this is trash that is not amusing, suspenseful or entertaining.the killer has no motive,okay maybe hes just sick...and very dull. maybe they could of gave a victim a story of their own. anything could be an improvement. it needed a lot more.they could of put just a little more into it. i love horror/slasher films but this is ridiculously bad.

could easily have been better. in fact maybe so much so that if the filmmaker hadn't tried even as hard as he did, it might have actually been better.on a good note. the lighting was reasonably okay. but pretty much everything else was lacking. wobbly camera work. (yeah, yeah, i know, that's supposed to be the style now.) poorly recorded audio. and editing that looked like someone watched too many ulli lommel movies (which are some of the worst edited movies.) to sum it up, the movie seemed to be a rationalization for the director/writer/main-character to get some young women naked, put them in fake bondage, and grope them, while saying "menacing" things.

this movie was absolute trash. the director and stars(?)should be banished from making movies forever. the paper-thin plot concerns a sleazy director played by the sleazy director (now thats acting) advertising on the internet for women to star in a snuff movie. there's no horror at all, the girls look strung-out and bored, the direction is pointless, the music is misplaced (heavy metal in a library scene?), and the lighting is awful. the director should have cashed in a couple more shopping carts full of aluminum cans and gotten a script, sober actors, and a few light bulbs. as it is, this is one disgusting, nasty, worthless mess of a movie.

i'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies, when you put them together that's my sweet spot: horrible sleaze. you're not going to get it in this film, though.there is certainly sleaze, in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured, tied naked to various things. the sleaze isn't very sleazy, though. it didn't register very high on my sleaze meter, mainly because none of the girls were in the least attractive, nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened. they seemed to be thinking more about what was for lunch, or maybe when they could score some crack.forget the effects, they were lame in the extreme. the lameness was contributed to by the bad acting; effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses aren't buying into them.cinematography was pretty bad, they could have hired a couple cameramen from a porn movie and done better. in fact, that might have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable. as it is, there are a lot of dark shots where you can't see very clearly, and what you can see isn't looking too good.the horror factor is nil. null. zero. nada. zip. zilch. i've seen kids movies that were more frightening. there's no camp here, either. it's just a movie that attempts to be shockingly sleazy, but doesn't even come close.

this movie is way too long. i lost interest about one hour into the story. saratoga trunk tells the story of ingrid bergman, who is an the child of a prominent new orleans man and his mistress. after her mother dies in paris, bergman comes back to new orleans to scandalize her father's "legitimate" family and to blackmail them. she meets gary cooper, who is likewise seeking revenge against the railroad tycoons who cheated his father out of his land in texas. she draws him into her schemes, and the movie climaxes at a saratoga resort. long and boring, but worth watching if you are a bergman or cooper fan. the midget cupidon provides the only bright spot in this meandering story.

the film begins with ingrid bergman and her two freaky servants arriving in new orleans from paris. apparently years earlier, her mother was involved in a scandal and ingrid returned in an effort to irritate kin who would have sooner forgotten she or her mother existed. that's because she reasons if they are shocked enough, they'll pay her off to get rid of her. then, with this money, she will leave new orleans and seek out a millionaire somewhere else, as she poses as a countess. along the way, gary cooper shows up and looks totally out of place as a love interest.it's amazing that this film wasn't the reason that ingrid bergman's film career plummeted--her performance and character were that bad! instead of the classy and demure female she usually played in films, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in film. her fake contessa was shallow, demanding, unpredictable and stupefyingly dumb. how she was able to vamp any man seemed a mystery, as she seemed less vampish than just plain nuts!! i am not exaggerating to say that she behaved, at times, like someone with a combination of a severe mental illness and a personality disorder, and all these together make me think "who in the world would fall in love with this mess?!". frankly, i couldn't stand watching her histrionics and narcissistic behavior and she looked more like a guest on "the jerry springer show" than a leading lady! confusing, awful and overacted are words that come to mind when i think about her role.the rest of the cast is, frankly, overwhelmed by bergman's ranting and hysterics. while gary cooper is generally an excellent leading man, he is dominated by her and just looks lost. and, oddly, they cast two total weirdos as her entourage--flora robson and jerry austin. ms. robson is best known for her portrayals of queen elizabeth i, but here, for some odd reason, they coated her in makeup and the end result looked much like the love child of a cigar store indian and aunt jemima! her face was very wooden, she sported odd eyebrows and she dressed like a slave. as for mr. austin, he was a dwarf and while this shouldn't be held against him, his role was written like he was a court jester--a very, very thankless role for someone who is "vertically challenged"! overall, the rotten acting, writing and limp direction make this one of the big stinkers of the age--nearly as pointless and dull as such famous turkeys as parnell and swing your lady.

based on the true story of two young americans who sold national secrets to the soviet union in the height of the cold war, "falcon and the snowman" wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical, and winds up falling short in both departments. it's less le carré than who cares.timothy hutton stars as christopher boyce, a former seminarian who, disgusted by watergate and the middle-class values around him, is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellites for the cia. sean penn plays his drug-dealing pal, daulton lee, who makes himself boyce's courier, delivering secret files to the soviet embassy in mexico city. an offbeat synth-jazz score, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone, and lots of scenes of guys getting angry in rooms all combine to deaden what could have a decent moral-dilemma thriller.it's really penn's movie despite the second billing; his character gets to talk turkey with the russians while hutton plays with his pet falcon. hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before they called "action". with penn, it's a crapshoot whether you get a brilliant performance or an over-the-top one. here, it's a bit of both, but more the latter, especially in the second half when lee switches from coke to heroin. he screeches. he snorts. he crashes russian embassy parties. he gets pummeled with telephone books. he spits at himself in a mirror, a big goober he must have been saving for a paparazzi. "i don't know who my friends are anymore!" he cries out. it's exhausting to just watch him.penn seems to have modeled lee somewhat on dustin hoffman's ratso rizzo from "midnight cowboy", complete with overly nasal line readings and constant eye shifting. john schlesinger directed this film as well as "midnight cowboy", but he seems to have had another hoffman film in mind, "the graduate", throwing up scene after scene of boyce and lee poolside, trying to decide how to live their lives in their gilded cage. too bad no one suggested plastics.from the opening shots, news footage of american decline juxtaposed with boyce and his bird, "falcon" makes clear it is a message movie, though the message itself is far from clear, probably because the characters never come into focus. is boyce supposed to be an idealist? or is he just a mercenary? hutton and schlesinger don't seem to know, which makes it harder for us. meanwhile, opportunities to establish some suspense, like boyce stealing documents from the top secret "black vault" where he works or lee playing games with the russians, are interrupted by jump cuts to scenes of the pair with their families and friends. it's the normalcy of the story that schlesinger finds interesting, but it's the least interesting aspect for us.good stuff: it's interesting to see a film that works the 1970s vibe so early as this one, referencing maria muldaur and tang. dorian harewood, memorable in "full metal jacket", has a nice turn as boyce's paranoid colleague gene, who shows boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder but has some serious 'nam issues beneath his partying exterior. macon mccalman is also fine in a totally different way as the no-nonsense boss who gives boyce his high-security job. david suchet as the russian embassy official who deals with lee makes for a fascinating blend of menace and amiability.but "falcon and the snowman" stands or falls on the the question of the two title characters, and neither the actors nor schlesinger are able to mine much in the way of answers. worse, after more than two hours in their alternately feral and catatonic company, you don't really want answers. you just want those credits to roll.

this belabored and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two buffoonish (one idealistic, one drug addled) california kids dealing secrets to the kgb never seems to get enough steam up to sustain any tension and suspense before it dies a very slow death over two hours later. john schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he was asleep in his director's chair most of the time as the film lags and the actors sleep walk, save for the highly annoying over the top performance of sean penn. childhood altar boys and friends chris (tim hutton) and daulton (penn) devise a plan to sell secrets to the kgb when chris lands a job that allows him access to top secret government materials. disillusioned by what he sees as us meddling in foreign affairs the idealistic chris and the drug hungry daulton make contact with the russians and begin to funnel them classified materials. when chris decides he wants out things begin to unravel at a lackadaisical pace. the eighties were not kind to distinguished director john schlesinger. in the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both england and america but then came honky tonk freeway in 1981 and it marked the beginning of the end. the falcon and the snowman more or less put a lid on it. lacking the suspense of marathon man and the quality performances (hoffman voight, christie, jackson, finch, olivier) he had coaxed from leads in the past falcon goes in circles most of the way. sean penn chews scenery from start to finish in such an obnoxious fashion you find yourself encouraging his torturers to do more to him. tim hutton is governed by his limited acting chops and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time. lori singer as hutton's girlfriend plays it mute most of the way with schlesinger content to film her vapid expressions. when she does emote you understand why. only david suchet as the kgb handler with a piercing eyed introspective presence and restraint acquits himself well.

i have seen shallow grave years ago, and *that* was one of those movies i kept in memory for a very long time. it was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists. but all of these made sense.i can't tell the same about dead bodies. above the title is a subtitle that claims it to be "even better than shallow grave". this is a big lie.dead bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the movie.two supporting characters for example, turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be. that could work as a surprise, but it didn't surprise me. i could see it coming minutes before, and *that* is a big difference with shallow grave.another thing i have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic. they behave like that more often when the movie gets to it's end.i would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent, not knowing what is going on. it would have been better for the contrast with for example tommy and his friend who have to carry a *huge* secret with them.but no, for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides. it does not work in a movie like this.the end felt much like an open end. it left me with an unsatisfied feeling. i expected a whole lot more of it.at first i would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie. i liked watching it. most of the time.but occasionally i saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end, i stick to four stars this time. and because it turned out to be a mistake that i have spend my time and money to it. unlike shallow grave, i will probably forget dead bodies very soon. it is just not such a special movie.the makers could have done a far better job with this movie. it is a shame that they did not.

this film was produced by producers releasing corp. (prc), among the so-called "poverty row" film studios of the 1930s and 40s. so you can imagine how little money was spent making it.the music is forgettable. cast member gerra young does exhibit an operatic-quality voice, but is sort of a discount deanna durbin. the imdb database doesn't show any other film appearances for her, so let's hope she was able to move on to some kind of position in grand opera.the opening credits for the print recently broadcast by turner classic movies indicates this film has been preserved by the national film museum. this immediately begs the questionwhy? are their resources so plentiful that they can afford to preserve junk? some low-budget or b musicals of that era have redeeming features which make them worthwhile. this film has none.in my opinion, skip this movie. it really wastes an hour of your time.

this was on tv last night. i painfully forced my way through it, and barely made it through. first of all, except for leroy, hilary, and possibly coco, none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent. it's like hspa had no standards, just sign on the dotted line and you're in. the story lines were grating and obvious. doris was just impossibly awful. the gay guy was such a thrown away cliché (funny how that school had only one gay guy, right...) i liked the leroy character, but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing. lisa looks like she'd rather be anywhere else, and since she wasn't any talent, i wonder why they kept her. i would have rated this one star (awful), but the music wasn't that bad, and i did like the premise. it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent.

my wife and i both remembered this film being a lot better than it is. when we rented it last weekend, we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years or so ago. we both agreed that we were probably remembering the tv series, which, in its one-hour segments, was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines. this movie leaves many loose threads, as has been mentioned by others here... basically every main character's story line is left unresolved.gotta like the title song, though.

fame did something odd. it was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen (most are based off of broadway musicals), but it spawned a tv series and a broadway musical. let me correct that sentence. fame is not a musical. musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters' feelings. the singing in this music is not used to do either; in fact, there's no use for it at all. people just randomly sing to fit in with the plot. and that's not the type of musical i know.the so-called plot of fame has an onslaught of characters (who are all introduced at once-last time i saw that in a movie [gosford park] it had disastrous results) who audition for, and get into, new york high school for the performing arts. all of them are in for different reasons-i.e. acting, singing, etc. quote-unquote drama unfolds as these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years.my largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective. after all, it's a free college, and they can't let everyone in. so how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college? obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people. and why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end, for no reason at all, except to make us feel uncomfortable? there's many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into, yet you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are! these relationships occur between people whose names you don't know. and these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie, yet you don't realize that, because you don't know what they were like in the first place.as for the singing, it pops in randomly (and is supposed to be humorous?) and does nothing. when the title song is sung, it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say ferris bueller everyone's in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off-beat to it. the song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. i would say more, but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head. just don't see it. you'll be doing yourself a favor.my rating: 2/10rated r for language.

no matter what you've heard, "fame" is not a good movie. it's not worth the investment of over two hours to watch stereotypically troubled teens dancing, singing, learning, and staring at girls in the dressing rooms.every cliché finds a cozy little home in this movie. there's a gay teenager looking for acceptance. that would have been great if it had been treated as anything more than a secondary plot point. there's a ghetto kid who has too much attitude-- what, was i surprised? and guess what? they all want to become big stars, finding fame and fortune, and they'd all be willing to crawl over their own mothers' smoking corpses to get it.oddly enough, this film is remembered for its music. but in actuality, the only moderately good song is "hot lunch jam," which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality. the two most popular songs are nothing, either. "fame" is meaningless fluff drowned out by the sheer spectacle of a massive dancing-in-the-streets scene. and "i sing the body electric" (what in bubba's name does that even mean?!?!?!?!?) is just an incomprehensible joke.bad acting, tasteless dialog, and hack direction (it is, after all, from the director of "evita") are only marginally helped by michael seresin's appropriately ordinary camera work. but cinematography alone cannot carry a movie, especially one as uninspiring and pointless as this.

there were very few good moments in this film. only a couple of characters were fleshed out and not that well. there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. the pace creep-ed along like an old man. there were many moments that the film never came back to like coco stripping. what happened to her? how about garci's sister? is she better now? what about leroy? we learned absolutely nothing about him. what about the electronic piano guy? how about the rich girl that got an abortion? what happened to her? that was an interesting subplot.overall this is not a good movie and i recommend another musical that was in this film. let's do the time warp again!!!!!!!

i just have to say that this was the third worst movie i have ever seen right after the attack of the murder tomato's 3 and starship troopers 2. it wasn't just dialogs or the paper walls or even the guns shots which just automagically disappeared with no holes in the walls. it was the horrible acting. no wonder that i have never seen these actors before they all probably slept with the director(s). i think i'am being nice to this movie now but that is only because i'am to tired from screaming at the movie (just saw it). my advice is to buy as many dvd's of this movie as you possibly can and burn it so no one ever can see this horrible waste of time, money and film ever again.

seems like some of the previous reviewers has seen another movie than what i saw earlier tonight... actually, this movie is the reason why i registered at imdb. sure bobbie phillips can "fight" and for that i give this movie a 2, but the rest of this movie is just pure crap... the acting is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. sure the actors are in physical good shape, but they cannot act! sometimes i enjoy watching bad movies for the laugh, but this movie had no charm and after i saw this movie i was filled with regrets for seeing it. sure, if you would like to see mediocre fighting without anything else then this movie is for you. if not then stay away from this film! ps: sorry for any spelling mistakes... i am just tired as a cause of this movie!

42/100. often referred as "tarzan with clothes on", but it's not at all in the same league as his far superior tarzan series. basically, the jungle jim series became a tarzan replacement for johnny weismuller, after he started getting too out of shape for a loincloth. in jungle jim, he is fully clothed. it can't compare to the tarzan series in any way, not in acting, screenplays or quality of production. it's pretty hokey stuff. this one is the first the best in the series, and that isn't saying much. too much stock footage is used, and it is so obvious. the score is overdone, and the plot is lame and the production is so poor it makes it hard to watch at times.

silly comedy casts an embarrassed-seeming ray milland as a british officer in world war ii europe escaping german confines and taking up with a man-hungry gypsy woman, played by marlene dietrich. slowly-paced, overlong, and miscast: the leads are far too old for this type of juvenile fodder, although marlene shines in her solo moments. it took three scriptwriters to adapt yolanda foldes' book for the screen, but this material must have already seemed dated by 1947--it smacks of something ernst lubitsch might have turned out in 1939. the scenario is musty, and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together. ** from ****

hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years, but none stranger than this. why this movie got made i will never know, nor how paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in 1947. it is the strangest mix of genres i have seen in a long time, a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a viennese operetta comedy.it tells the story of a british spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of germany in the days just before ww ii began. ray milland, a fine actor, is stuck playing the part like an escapee from monty python, all very exaggerated english prep-school dialogue. in germany he meets a gypsy, marlene dietrich, who helps him to travel under cover as, of course, another gypsy. she plays her part like the typical viennese operetta gypsy caricature, as do the other "gypsies" in the movie. but there are also nazis, who are not funny at all. and then milland finds he is starting to think like a gypsy, and that is not treated as a joke. sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. every time the nazis show up, the film score plays wagner, which is funny by itself.this movie could have been a comedy, or it could have taken the plight of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the nazis treated them. both are hinted at in this movie, but neither pursued. what we are left with is a truly strange mish-mash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone (except the director) involved.bizarre.

why is it that instant noodles aren't instant, this was the perplexing problem i placed in the lap of the one legged angry sherpa; he angrily retorted that noodles weren't his bag, equally i replied "what bag?" he looked further perplexed.some of you will be wondering, why has the sherpa only one lower appendage.the sherpa, who we shall call sherpa 5, for data protection reasons, injured his toe. "how!?!" i hear you ask, i will proceed, as we have learnt from the review of donkey punch (2002) irene via sly nudges and dirty winks etc tried in vain to teach the slight peculiarities of checkers to all the angry sherpas. sherpa 5 who is known only for his violent tirades against democratic principals during the post revolutionary years of the now united states of america and it's consequential affect on the mind sets of it's population in the post modern empire that now exists, through the invasions of countries smaller than it, got carried away in a river of violence due to his lack of comprehension of checkers. according to an eye witness , he sprung around like a feckless banjo string at mardi gras wielding a stick with nail through it, after the struggle that ensued 5 llamas were each found to be missing their left testicles, 3 sherpas were discovered spooning beneath a gooseberry bush and sherpa 5 had the nail stuck in his big toe.a sherpas lifestyle is as modest as a nuns, with only rudimentary health care facilities at 15000 ft above sea level. consequentially when the first aid hut was opened only an iou for a tin of spam, and some crotchless knickers were found. sherpa 5 hopped around like a dark on a noose in agony, until irene burst forth like a cock from a hen house and suggested soaked his ailment in llama spit. sherpa 5 agreed to the procedure , to sedate him, a bottle of 100 yr old glenfiditch was produced, some say it was left by an angry scotsman, who is thought to be an ancestor of the angry sherpas. one under the influence, the toe was bathed until ridged, dressed with irenes slightly soiled diaphragm and some blue tack. some of you may feel that this procedure wouldn't do the sherpa any good and you would be fully vindicated for holding that view. only four days later gangrene set it and a week later the leg was removed through the use of even tighter elastic bands

to soccer fans every where -- stay away from this movie. it was so baaaaddd! lame acting, lame script, lame soccer and no directing! i rented this movie during my stint in asia and was appalled that this was considered one of the better singaporean films. it was just nonsensical and thoroughly boring. there are thousands of rich, exciting stories in asia. why write a bad story about over the top and stereotypical singaporeans?

okay, so i'm singaporean and i would like to say that it's time to stop stereotyping singaporeans and making such films. some of the actors/actresses actually have talent, but sadly it wasn't shown much in this film. i was fidgeting in my seat when i watched this, being quite young at that time, my parents dragged me along to see it. honestly i could say that i was going to fall asleep. and there was this arrogant westernized boy whom just got on my nerves. overall a boring film, and a general waste of the actors' talent. i have seen better singaporean movies than this. chicken rice war was good. however, i cannot believe that this one would be considered a better singaporean film. sorry, i wouldn't recommend it.

1 thing. this movie sucks big time..i was into singaporean comedy when chiken rice war came along. but, this time, even gurmit singh (well-done) acting cant pull this one of. a total failure of following hk's shaolin soccer. next time: do ur own thing!

even though i tried to avoid german films recently, positive reviews lured me into renting this one. there i stand fooled again by german media which has been hyping domestic flicks over and over again. to me it is no wonder no one abroad wants to see this crap. the idea to make this film is no idea at all (i guess some fool read a women's magazine article about speed-dating). in short: the characters (which are none), dialogue and content are so stunningly trivial, trite and cliché-ridden, i continued watching because i could hardly believe what i saw. btw to call the flat theses mechanically delivered by the figures (certainly from the aforementioned magazines) dialogue, would be simply incorrect. acting is so over-the-top, i can't remember worse than that on screen in a long time. you have to guess the director had/has no clue at all. amazingly distributors and producers around the country are still wondering why german films (with rare exceptions) generate no interest world-wide. why? because it's waste of time and money.

well, i have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face. ok, but that does not make it a good movie. most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing. not all of them give great acting performances, but some really try, but fail because their characters are badly written. the perfect example is julia koschitz: she changes her eating habits from one talk to the other, on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is allergic to champagne, she feels too beautiful for most people (in fact she is) but still ends up with the "perfect" fit concerning the looks, and refuses to give some more "realistic" guys a chance, and so on... the end is very cheesy, although i like one of the final scenes, when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again. shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters (mostly because it is about sex and relationships, i assume) and maybe some short entertainment. still, the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it.

this feels like a feature-lenght treatment of a comedy-routine that could have also been told in a ten-minute short. also, technical credits are sup-par. the film really feels like a film school diploma project.the cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented newcomers but the problems is the superficial scrip. their lines feel constructed, exactly like cued tv show material.the director fails to take his protagonists seriously, therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts.the film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point, but in the end the film disappoints on all levels.

not finding the right words is everybody's problem in this vaudeville-type urban comedy. they don't know what to say, and they don't know how to say it, which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre-arranged speed dating. unfortunately, they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people. the story follows a conventional three-act structure: getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives, the actual dating circuit, and a final stretch of romantic fallout, showcasing some of the new-found couples' follies. because it's all so predictable, i'd say that as a narrative, "shoppen" is a failure. as a comedy, most of the time it's too goofy to be really funny. thumbs up to kathrin von steinburg. she stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof, independently wealthy miriam. great makeup on her too (verena weißert): heavy eye shadow meets skin-tone lip gloss, creating a brooding and bohemian, yet girlish effect. thumbs up also to stefan zinner as the bavarian love machine and tanja schleiff as the hot nutritionist. they bypass the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of copulation.

i saw that this movie was coming out and could not wait to see it. i have to say i was very disappointed with it. this would have been better as a mini-series. the whole show seemed very rushed. they did not explain things very clearly. at the end they showed john paul ii, alive and well and the next scene he was dead. never any explanation as to what happened. (we all know what happened in real life) i think abc dropped the ball big time on something that could have been great. in all i think this movie was a blur. it seemed like a drunken monkey jumping around from one point in john paul's life to another point never explaining how or why things happened. such as when his older brother leaves, it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and that is why he left home. also when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the floor and that was that. i was very disappointed with the over all movie.

the people at abc forgot to do their biographical research... so many scenes were just plain wrong! the actor playing jpii was very rigid, there was no personality there. it is very very obvious that this movie was on the bottom of the programming totem poll, the move is so low budget. the script is terrible. conversations like: "you must follow the rules" "no, the people are starving." lame. plus, the movie was jumping like crazy from event to event in order to fit it into the two hours. terrible! a better use of your time would be to watch a pbs documentary on jpii. also, cbs put out a miniseries on jpii that is better than abc by far. jpii was a wonderful man, and it bothers me to think that my grandkids might get a hold of this abc movie and think that that is what he was really like!

this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever see, yet once i started, it was just like the really bad car wreck on the side of the road - you can't help yourself, you just have to look. my eyes !!! the acting was awful, the production was awful, the filming was awful, awful, awful, awful. i was glad the priest got chopped, would have loved to have done it myself because of his poor acting. i mean suck-ful acting to the tenth power. i would have cheered if chris had just axed the lot of them before turning it on himself. and what was with that freaking wig from hell on his head?! i sincerely hope no one got paid, i mean if getting paid were to be considered here, they should be paid to never attempt another film project again, everyone that was involved, never, never again. that was just a huge piece of garbage that i am embarrassed to say i just had to keep watching until the very end. don't watch it, it's about an hour and a half of your life you will never get back, and then you'll have to spend time registering on this website so you can write a comment like i am doing now, which you must do as a catharsis in order to survive the aftershocks of having viewed this film (and i use the term "film" loosely here).

just saw this movie yesterday night and i almost cried. no, it wasn't because it got me utterly petrified, no. it was absolutely horrendous! sometimes, you see movies that make you wonder what will become of the human race in the near future - this movie is one of those. it's as though the writer, actors, director, et al, just came together and copied and pasted scenes of their favorite horror flicks, zipped it all together and said "hey, here's satan's whip!!!" after seeing this movie, i could not help but be tormented by the sight of people whom call themselves "actors"; waltzing around like they're some kind of talented artistic interpreters... do not be fooled they suck! don't bother wasting your time or money!!!

i was lucky enough to grow up surfing in san diego (not the biggest waves in the world but it was a hell of childhood, i'll tell you that) and i have seen a lot of so-called surfer flicks in my life. after watching north shore for the first time just now, all i can say is thank god i never saw this as a kid. if i had seen this and mistakenly thought that this was a realistic portrayal of the surf scene, i would sold my board and totally gotten into, i don't know, accounting or something.seriously, this movie has a as much in common with real surfing as top gun has was real military life. the acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is iffy at best and oh my god what was laird hanilton thinking?! wow!!! do not see this movie!!! it sucks!!! if you want a real surf flick, see riding giants. hell, watch surf's up instead of this. seriously. sucks. sucks bad. sucks real bad. brah. ;)ps: had to change my summery from "wtf?!" to wtf because, apparently, we are supposed to whisper on this site. no yelling!!! (shhhhhh!) ;d

this film has the language, the style and the attitude down ... plus greats rides from occy (a world champ) and the great jerry lopez. john philbin as turtle has the surf pidgin down, and the surfing scenes are still the best ever. a true classic that can be seen many times. nia peeples is a babe, and laird hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world's number one extreme surfer.

the bad news: the canadian version of beast in the cellar released by maple pictures that i saw was of poor quality. dark and washed out, it appeared to be dubbed haphazardly from a vhs tape. it even skips at one point due to some missing frames.the good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the dvd detracted little from my viewing enjoyment. this horror movie fails to build tension and lacks scares. it is a horrorless horror film. while most frightening films have limited dialog, beast in the cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character will repeat something we have just heard said by two other characters. presumably, all the chit chat acts as filler for a very low budget, unimaginative movie. unfortunately, the dialog isn't campy enough to make it worth a watch.

one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the 1970s is that they don`t hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a case in point as are all those amicus anthology movies . add the beast in the cellar to the list much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end . once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film . it does open with a fairly good hook but after that we`re treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk . correct me if i`m wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk ? the only sort of interest to be found in the beast in the cellar is the anti-smoking stance . some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military film but watch carefully and you`ll see that everytime a squaddie lights up for a fly puff he gets killed . rather strange considering attitudes to smoking weren`t nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays

i have rated this movie a 1/10 and have done this in good nature. this movie is not as it seems and i don;t get the point of it. take the first joke for instance. their's that sign at the beginning to start. well that was ok but then they start having some guy talking about the hood and then he dies then theirs the other guys who talks then he dies after the other guy says people don;t get to their birthday with out dieing. and he gets a cake now. then he dies. the jokes are just stupid they are;t that smart and i would have thought they would have been better from some one like the directors of scary movie:shawn wayans (written by) & marlon wayans (written by) & phil beauman (written by)but it sucked and i hop next time they want to make another comedy they make some good jokes not lame ones.

going by the good words of my friends, i hired this movie, hoping that it would at least equal the laughs of the similar movie, "house party", but i was very disappointed, and very bored.falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. i don't know whether this didn't appeal to me because i don't live in "da hood", or if i'm not black, but it's probably one of the two.it tries to spoof a few movies, only coming up with a couple of laughs, but in the long run it fails miserably. miss it.

ok, i will make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie. everybody knows of motion picture association of america's ratings: g, pg, pg-13, r, and nc-17. for the purposes of this movie, i think the mpa should create a new rating standard: iq-20.

(mild spoilers)this movie was filthy and stupid. it could have done well without the constant humping and nude sex. it was also very profane. i think that they had a good story developing, but they messed up the whole thing by overdoing it.

"menace" is not funny. it tries hard - too hard. but rarely brings a smile. there is no acting, just mugging. one of the main characters wears a stupid grimace on his face the entire movie. no doubt as the less talented wayans brothers starred, wrote and produced the film they were entirely blind to their lack of talent.menace consists of a series of unfunny, one joke skits. the punchline can be seen a mile off, but you have to wait until it all unfolds. no zippy one-liners or snappy dialogue here. just one scene after another building up to the joke. the jokes themselves are juvenile. loc dog (the one with the perma-grimace) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she picks her nose and then, wait for it (remember you must always w-a-i-t) she farts! how funny is that? ten-year old boys may find it funny as they won't have heard the jokes as many times before. alternatively, if you like watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to follow along and may even find it amusing. the challenge will be getting drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without passing out.

now i know that a lot of black humor pokes fun at typical black things like for example gold teeth. but that doesn't mean that they always are funny. don't be a menace is an example of this. the urban movie certainly lends itself for satire. the problem is that wayans and consorts not only try satirize the typical 'ghetto' culture, they also belittle valid statements that are made in urban movies such as boyz 'n' the hood or menace ii society. personally i think that the makers of this movie should get their heads away from the bowel movements of their white masters. besides this, the movie in itself is terrible. it's absolutely not funny. the jokes are racist. instead of satirizing the urban movie genre, the moviemakers show their views of the 'ignorant' urban (ghetto) blacks. now there are some other jokes in this movie, but i believe this to be the main fare.in conclusion this movie is crap and the makers should use their talents to make a constructive comedy/satire movie. they have examples in men with black hats (which was made before this movie) and friday.

the is one of the worst spoofs i have ever seen. for one main reason: it isn't funny! i laughed a handful of times. the acting is bad, the script is worse. and why those guys had baby pacfiers in their hair i will never know. and you can tell this didn't have much of a budget to work with and it openly hurts the film. they had a good idea going in some parts but it never really came to past. and what was the point about the lead being older than his dad? 3 out of 10

i don't understand the humor in this film. i also found it offensive on how koreans were depicted in that film, despite how it is actually just a caricature of koreans in those areas. first, the actors are japanese, and they make the most rude expressions of koreans in that film. it disgusts me on how these people are expressed. i felt anger just watching that one scene, and how they were so badly made out in the film. the humor lasts just for one laugh, and then you don't understand why it's even funny. it's crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there. i found it to be an offensive film overall... maybe it was just because i never lived in the "hood" or saw any "hood" movies, but i don't intend to either.

when i heard they were making this i was quited happy considering the first film was pretty good, if a little on the short side.but then i remembered some of the disney sequel disasters i have previously watched (im looking at you little mermaid 2).anyway i watched it and unfortunately i was very disappointed. the best thing about it is the animation is superb. it really has that special polish that the "proper" disney films have.apart from that.. the rest is disappointing. the storyline is seriously all over the place. one moment its about something, then completely changes to another storyline and then changes to another completely different storyline. it reminded me of how the family guy movie was like 3 separate episodes, turned into a film.i laughed perhaps once at the most. kronk was very funny in the original film but in this he just isn't funny at all.stay away from this film, unless someone lends it to you for free.4/10

ewww! a disney sequel that is rubbish! who would have thought it? actually, quite a lot judging by the comments here, and they aren't wrong. i actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original. and therein lies disney's whole "cash-in" mentality. shovel out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it. don't think they are that cynical? ask yourself this, then....how many disney films have sequels? and then....how many of those sequels spawn a follow-up? a significantly lower number.kronk's new groove is just another example of this. the plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out. even more annoying was the increased number of "out of place" items and scenes - an old folks home for example and, god forbid an aztec version of the boy scouts! worse yet, kronk's opposing chippamunk leader has a completely bewildering over-the-top english accent for no reason whatsoever. an accent that was, after a very short while, intensely grating on the nerves.there are a couple of good things. the animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the sub-standard dialogue they are given - especially warburton in the lead role. but other than this there really is nothing to recommend it. sure, little kids may like it, but there is little to amuse mum and dad whilst they sit through this tortuous maiming of the original concept.avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you'd use in avoiding a pack of ravening man-eating lions.

this coming from an adult who happened to come across the first one expecting a movie aimed towards children and was surprised at the adult humor that was in emperors new groove. the character i liked most of all was kronk, so i was thrilled when i heard of the sequel (sp) featuring non other than "kronk".i just watched kronk's new groove, it took me two days because i had to shut it off, i was so bored halfway through it. i finally watched the rest of it the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was every bit as lame as the first.being a disney film, i was expecting to have some musical scenes, however this one was filled with them and they were not amusing. the great thing i found about emperors new groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. kronks new groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first. it is really aimed towards young children, the comedy is pretty childish, the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely corny.save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because its definitely not worthy of a second viewing. i was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was. they actually managed to make a character(kronk)not funny in this film, that is amazing in itself.obviously every ones opinion differs but i am very easily amused, i usually enjoy sequels (sp) even when others discredit them, mostly because i loved the first so much i needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was i would enjoy the film. i cannot say the same for this one, i never would have thought i would be turning it off half way through due to pure boredom.buy at own risk.

this is the worst waste of time i've ever experienced. not even close to the first one. the story line difficult to follow - plot was weak - at best. the whole thing looked like three stories trying some way to tie them together and make a movie. it had a few good lines here and there - and the attempt at the message was admirable, but they went from houston through new york to get to dallas. it was really hard to tell over what period of time the present time took up. the movie was just over an hour and it felt like we had sat there watching the movie all afternoon. mayve points for being honest - but a son should not have to do all that kronk felt he had to do. do your self a favor - watch kuzco again.

what we have here the standard disney direct to dvd sequel, where i would expect cots are cut in all areas resulting in an okay animated movie that falls well short of the original. that is not to say that this is a terrible movie it is just that it is a very mediocre movie full of the preachy messages intended to show children the virtues of friendship and being nice to one another and unless done subtly (which it is not here) can quickly become grating for adults. the film has a very thin plot line with kronk trying to win the approval of his father, and ending up finding the true meaning of wealth and success. this has it's comedy moments but is really nor enough to carry a full length film.

another direct to video movie from disney, that is essentially perfect for the kids. the problem with kronk's new groove i find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and sombre film. in this movie, kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others' expenses. it takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film.kronk's new groove deals with two stories: yzma returns for payback and one ms. birdwell hopes to defeat kronk's camp counseling championship. this all leads up to kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his son's direction in life.from lord of the rings to michael jackson's thriller, kronk's new groove recycles every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers. if you loved the original, or are looking forward to the upcoming tv series about kuzco, i recommend kronk to his loyal fans.

i really liked the movie 'the emporer's new groove', but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having "relations" with a llama. seriously, this movie was bad. it's like club dread after super troopers. i am supposed to write 10 lines, but i don't even know what else to say. i laughed a couple of times, but only because i was drinking. a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk. it was not. maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people aren't. either way, just stick with the emporer's new groove if you want a funny, cartoon, llama-themed movie. line 10 is this line right here.

this might sound weird, but i only got to see the first movie (the emperor's new groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and only because of one episode of the tv show. i simply adore kuzco's character, but kronk isn't that bad either. anyway, eventually i decided to watch the second film, just so i would've seen it. hoped it would be as good as the first one, but... i'm sorry to tell this, but the more the humour got american, the more i yawned. i agreed with kuzco when he started crying seeing all the cheesy footage.still, younger kids and probably veterans too will love this movie to bits (if they like the old school moralising disney that is), but i just had expectations that were an eensy teensy little bit hell of a lot higher than they should've been. kronk is a lovely character, being good hearted and dumb all at once, but it were pacha and kuzco in drag that woke me up at the end of the movie. (i'll ignore rudy... for as far that's possible).anyway, great movie, just not my style and as they say, you always have to be true to your groove.

the emperor's new groove cast returns for disney pictures follow up, but this time the spotlight is on kronk(voiced by patrick warburton), who is no longer yzma's(eartha kitt)henchman. kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant. things go merrily along until kronk gets word that his papi(john mahoney)is coming for a visit. kronk is worried, because he knows that his life won't impress his papi. one thing that he has always wanted and never received is a "thumbs up" from his dad. a flurry of blunders and a gigantic cheese explosion in the restaurant leaves our likable hero very deep in trouble and anxiety. to save the day, a little help from his friends.other voices: tracey ullman, david spade, john goodman, wendie malick, april winchell and gatlin green.

...but of course i was wrong.now, i never expected to like the first movie. i'm not sure what's up with disney's marketing group, but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up turning me off as too childish, or silly, or stupid, and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but. and no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than the emperor's new groove, which is why i was quite surprised to actually find myself quite enjoying that film when i finally broke down and saw it. i entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained.despite disney's track record with direct-to-video sequels, i had nonetheless hoped for a better experience with kronk here... but in the end i was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that i felt that way). there's almost no humor targeted towards adults. the original songs are uninspired and sickly cute. the animation, while not bad, still doesn't come close to emperor (which was no lion king to start with).the main plot, as such, is astoundingly "minor" and is comprised mainly of a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - in fact the while thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a saturday morning cartoon series than a well conceived single entity.david spade gets about four lines throughout the entire movie and there isn't exactly a lot of john goodman either, so overall we're just left with far too much of patrick warburton's kronk - who was entertaining as a secondary character in the first movie but is completely inappropriate as the main lead here.although kids might find it somewhat fun, the only thing kronk's new groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and watch the far superior original.

the emperor's new groove was a great twist for disney. it wasn't a musical! it had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. it was just a darn funny movie.kronk's new groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. my 3-year-old still loves emperor's new groove, but fell asleep during kronk's. there really isn't any really conflict (that, in the first movie, lead to all of the wacky adventures). because of the lack of conflict, it almost seems like the animators threw out the writers and just made the storyline up as they went along.i kept waiting for something to happen that would make the movie fun . . . and still am.

thinking that it could only get better was the worst assumption i ever made....drivvle does not describe this movie appropriately enough!not only is the plot thin, but i get more emotional acting from my pet fish!it was a shame to see pete postlethwaite, whom i respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with...i think that a cardboard cut out of stephen baldwin would have done a better job , and in fact have been more animate.avoid at all costs! this could really be hazardous to your health!

the basic idea for this movie was good, but there was no real character development and the pacing was slow. maybe because i saw it in a sloppily edited, pan&scanned video version ? (it went straight to video in france.)

george sluizer of the vanishing fame ( he made both the haunting european original and the hollywood remake ) directed crimetime . he shouldn't really be blamed for this confused , poor movie because all the problems lie in brendan somers script . it's ill focused and lazily written . for instance the killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to pick up a victim , any victim and starts talking to a teenage girl . cut to the next scene where she tells the villain " i've told you everything about myself , tell me about your life ? " unfortunately the girl has told the baddie her life story off screen and is a terrible example of the screenwriter not being able to bring a character to life through dialogue . i know for a fact how bloody difficult this is but for a screenplay that is produced the writer should have tried harder it's difficult to explain the message of the film . at some points it feels like it's trying to be a british natural born killers satarising the media's voyeurism with crime ( perhaps it even influenced the infamous video game manhunt ) but the script isn't witty enough to carry this off . when you've got a sex scene that doesn't progress the plot or characters or hint of subtext you know you've got a badly written screenplay and crimetime is a badly written screenplay

a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected, it isn't called snake island because it's just soooooo much fun to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population, which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls. this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors. the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ain't anything couldn't see in a pg13 rated movie, folks. if you are into snake movies than check out sssssss, but don't torture yourself with this crap.

i will not vote this movie as an awful one, mainly because i kind of like it, i was one of those summer days that i was so lame to do anything and decided do rent a movie in the stupid section of the videostore. besides that i didn't slept in the nigh before and the movie got me awake...let's just start the autopsy, ok, the movie haves a strange plot, first is isolation, there is an expedition, they get isolated in an island because there is no gas on the boat, something like that, there is not a single convincing performance on the actors part(so far), the main problem starts after the isolation idea, the pov of a snake, then another, ...then another, then snakes that change, then false spooks, a lot of them, and when we believe the movie is going on a good way for a b flick keeping the suspense it fails, because after ten or eleven spooks we don't get carried away, the one scene that unmistifies all is the scene when we witness a drunk lesbian show watched by snakes that seem to dance, after this it's becoming not a horror\adventure but a comedy driven movie, the adventure part is discarded also.for me the problem in a movie is the third act, it is the one section that just drives the movie for a already guessed conclusion, or if it succeeds we don't noticed it, like a ninja smoke in our eyes, well....snake island haves a bad conclusion, it all comes to a «by the book» ending, with a confront, persecution and escape sequence, it was predictable in the moment i rented the dam copy. the other real problem is concept, concept is very important, it is the reason you believe in dinosaurs coming to life or a corpse full of stitches that just wants to live, the main concept about snakes that want revenge after decades on torture by the human civilization, well...hmmm, just doesen't glues on the wall. one thing you will enjoy (if you watch it with an opened mind) is the more b-z sequences, naked lesbian girls, some amateur camera angles, the braindead homage with the grass cutter, the black dude doesen't die first, and thats all... if you want to see snakes, black dudes and comedy and you prefer bigger budgets go and see «snakes on a plane».hasta moviegoers

a wide variety of snakes stage an uprising on tourists "invading" their island due their captain's boat damage. the few remaining survivors who aren't caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission, their goal to flee to available boats which can get them safely off the island.presented straight-faced with injected doses of visual humor featuring lots of snake gags, wayne crawford's snake island features plenty of different breeds of the slithery predators, in striking position, ready to attack their prey. star william katt, as an author researching snakes for a forthcoming novel, has fun in his role along with writer / director / co-star wayne crawford(..as the tourist boat captain) as put-upon heroes who stare down a most serious crisis. kate connor is crawford's attractive love interest, a lawyer on vacation. the other cast members serve as either tourists or crew, mostly fodder for the snakes. as in many other movies of this type, director crawford features live snakes with computer generated ones, and the violence is really tame. crawford even incorporates the point-of-view technique with the camera as the eyes of the snake as it faces the potential victim(..with the actor looking directly into the camera). never to be taken seriously, the tongue-in-cheek approach was probably the best way to shoot snake island because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on it's own.the effects and suspense scenes rarely work because crawford is often unable to successfully stage the sequences where humans face off with the snakes. the snake attacks themselves also never happen on screen(..one or two tops), or are so limply presented they leave little impression. that's a no-no for a genre such as this. fans of katt will probably want to check it out because he does provide some facial comedy that establishes the overall tone of certain scenes where he must defend himself against the snakes. the cgi scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a general area aren't very effective which remove the realism crawford might've attempted to establish. there are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the aggressors than snake island. surprising moments of nudity, relegated to a scene where the tourists and crew unwind after a long day with the bubbly, not knowing what danger lie ahead.

now we know where they got the idea of snakes on a plane. to put it bluntly, do not pay to see this movie. if you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then either catch it on cable, or get it as a free pick from netflix or blockbuster. do not pay to rent this. if you do pay to rent this, then you are one stupid individual. the acting was awful, the plot was awful, everything was awful except for the snakes. whether they were real or cgi generated, they did look pretty good. but that being said, still this movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. even the nude dancing scene was pretty bad that i actually fast forwarded through that. don't sat i did not warn you.

i really don't think it's necessary that i write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as "snake island", but even in the abstract confines of its own genre, this hit a new low, so my anger must be known. the only reason why i even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because i knew it was going to be bad, it was really late at night, i could not sleep, and in the past, really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber. it became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful, but it condescended below even those expectations.the movie was directed and written by wayne crawford, who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the african river, who ends up having to strand his team on a remote island called snake island until another boat comes down to pick them up. they hang out, get drunk, and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings.if your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't bother to reread it, you got it right the first time. frankly, i prefer my creature features when the creature(s) just attack the nonsensically dumb humans out of hunger, not because they have some kind of a mission. these aren't mutant snakes. they're not giants like what you see in "anaconda." they're just ordinary, everyday african snakes like mambas and vipersonly they have the brains to form armies, take up causes, work together to trap people, understand our language, and even dance! did your draw drop again? well, it's going to drop further. amount midway through this awful b-movie, about the part where i'd already given up, the human characters start drinking around a campfire and then all of a sudden, they break down into some kind of an orgy. and while they dance nude and such, the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it. the combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes, some the most roguish creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason, proved just too much for my poor brain. and just when i though the filmmakers couldn't take it to an even lower level, the snakes started to sing.the people in the movie? well, let's just say that never before have i rooted for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly. i just could not stand it any longer.i really don't think i need to keep going on; you get the picture. if there is anything that makes "snake island" any different from its other rivals, it's that it does dare to try to be even dumber and that's not a complimentary achievement. whyjust whyi continue to subject myself to these really bad movies, i guess i'll never really know. but "snake island" hits a brand new low. it's a cheap, trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes "anaconda," a brainless snake movie, look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as steven spielberg's "jaws." you have been warned.

don't waste your time. one of those cool-looking boxes that you pick up at blockbuster on a hunch, but not even worth that. you will not say, "it's so bad, it's good." just, "it's bad." the greatest american hero is a writer who rents a cabin on african island, called snake island. some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off, but they are not staying on the island. they just stop there to let off the writer. then the boat is stranded there, and --in true hollywood originality-- the one and only radio on the island is busted. so they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes. like hundreds of them, which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere. it's not like there ever was one main snake. like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes. instead, there are just a bunch of ham-and-egger snakes of all kinds of breeds. their only goal, then, was to escape the island...as opposed to having to conquer the enemy. because there were so many snakes, you knew they couldn't possibly try to kill them all, and they didn't try. i've seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up. at least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending. in snake island (by the way, every single character was shocked to see snakes on the island...duhhhhh, it's named snake island for a reason), there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat. oh, they never do get gas by the way. they "just happen" to find another boat on the island already gassed up.

i usually like movies about animals or reptiles turning against the mean old humans who threaten their environment, but i have to say snake island was a major letdown.the premise is interesting, a group of people, including a writer numbly played by william katt, goes to an island called, duh, you guessed it "snake island", and quess what the island lives up to it's name. that is one thing i will give this movie, there are snakes, lots and lots of snakes of all sizes and kinds. so that part of the movie in fairness lives up to its name, but the writing, acting and directing is soooooooo lame it is almost painful to sit through.the characters are so unlikeable i was begging for the snakes to finish these horrible people off to put us all out of our misery. there are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous they have be seen to be believed---snakes gyrating to really horrible disco music while 2 women dance seminude together and a scene with a snake holding some inane dialogue with one of the actors, it's beyond absurd. i think the writer was trying to be funny but this just came off like some weird lsd trip...i remember william katt years ago back when he starred in "carrie", what a hunk he was..not that he was ever a major star, but to be reduced to this garbage, i feel for him.avoid this movie like the plague unless you are really into movies that feature lots and lots of snakes and really horrible humans.

snake island is one of those films that, whilst one sits and watches its amazing level of stupidity, makes one wish the film camera had never been invented. the real reason why plan 9 from outer space will hold onto its honoured title of worst film of all time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is. it is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining bad film you will ever see. snake island is the other kind of bad. snake island is just so bad that it is excruciating. a stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys tapping one-key typewriters onto transparencies that were then overlapped in order to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. filmed entirely on location in south africa, the environments in which the film takes place are about the only element that can truthfully be considered well-realised. many shots involving snakes consist of close-ups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are cgi, puppets, or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugs.william katt stars, if you can call it that, as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry. coming along with him is an assortment of very generic, poorly-defined characters. it is all a matter of random screen writing as to who survives to the end, but katt certainly appears to be contemplating firing his agent. the rest of the cast seem to be from the home and away acting school, where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by open-mouthed gaping and darting one's eyes about in every direction. the foley effects are often worse, with one memorable scene where a double-barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany gunshots in such games as bioforge. meanwhile, snakes continually explode or jump about at random. it would have been more accurate to call the film snake holocaust.of course, no z-grade horror or sci-fi film is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undress. as every woman in the cast, almost, gets their clothes off, the film starts to become less snake island and more snake island orgy. but like all the worst piles, all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff. the sex scenes never eventuate, and the deaths of characters are so flat, so uninteresting, that the entire film becomes pointless. unless you consider watching william katt running through a muggy forest wearing ill-fitting cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat a payoff. for the record, i don't. i used to think that anaconda was the worst film ever made about predatory snakes. i was so very, very wrong. at least anaconda had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time. some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the shoelaces from some pairs of combat boots i have worn.so we so far have the checklist for bad horror films running along nicely. the unrecognisable, lame cast are accounted for, as are poor audio and visual effects. the dialogue is so wretched, so ill-timed, that i have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays i have acted in many moons ago. unfortunately, where snake island falters in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films. in essence, it forgets to be so bad that it is funny. it is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak. compared to william katt's performance in snake island, jon voight's performance in anaconda was as oscar-worthy as russell crowe's in gladiator. not that voight or katt are necessarily bad actors, but with material like this, you're hard-pressed to say a single word naturally. listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. one's mind tends to blank out the experience, primary as a self-defense mechanism.because of the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad, i gave snake island a two out of ten. my special score for films that are so bad they cannot possibly be good, but not bad enough to entertain. it is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern. the proper way to spell "crap" is s-n-a-k-e-i-s-l-a-n-d.

i'm not going to lie and say i don't watch the show--i do. but it has a lot, and a lot of flaws. 1) the boarding school is perfect. the drama is at a minimum. everyone is so nice to each other, you know. lets give that a reality check. its impossible that any school is perfect like pca. free laptops for everyone. big dorm rooms. mini fridges. if there was a school like that in real life, almost nobody there would be a virgin for one. two, everyone there is so rich, and its weird how nobody has anything stolen yet. 2) characters really unrealistic. first things first, who in they're right minds talk like they do. they talk like a perfect teenager would. secondly, logan reese(matthew underwood) is an extremely rich boy "hot" teenage boy. my question is, why isn't almost ever girl in that school all over him? he's rich and "hot" now a days all those girls would be after him, even if he was a jerk. also, chase is the most stupidest person ever. he is this shy teenager who claims to not be in love with zoey, and over-reacts to everything that involves zoey. she must be blind not to see him in love with her.come on nick. i know you can do better than that. please..

zoey 101 is basically about a girl named zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it. that raw plot line is, i'll admit, a pretty good idea. although this show was meant for children, a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws. first, zoey is a cliché character, her being super popular, super attractive, super smart, and there;s nothing wrong with her; no girl is like that. it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie lynn spears and increase her fame. dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just plain mean. however, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of them all, which is sad seeing that dana is never nice. nicole is too peppy and acts like a complete airhead, but mysteriously gets straight a's. lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmy-deserving acting skills. quinn is supposed to be super smart, and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things, she is also made out to be weird, and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart, while zoey, lola, and nicole get guys and they're all beauty and no personality. chase and michael are very similar, and i even sometimes get them confused. logan is unrealistically rich, and hands out millions like they're dollars. nobody's that rich. i've also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that stacy girl, who does nothing but act nice to them. that's not funny! that's mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people. finally, the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5-star amenities such as a scenic location, sushi bar, hot lounge equipped with free soda machines, pool&jacuzzi, movie theater, and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other sex's dorm rooms. at most boarding schools, if a boy were to go into a girl's dorm or vice versa they would be expelled.in conclusion, zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process.

zoey 101 is such a stupid show. i don't know if that's because the snooty jamie lynn spears is the prissy star of it or what, but i just know that the show sucks. it's about a girl and her brother who go to a boarding school. the jokes in this show are extremely dull and unfunny, and i hate every single character except chase and lola. heck, the jokes on this show are so unfunny that they make jack black look like monty python.this show is without a doubt one of the worst shows on nickelodeon, it's right down there with avatar and danny phantom in the pit of shame, and if this show was a person with any honor, it would hang itself in shame.1/10

this is a children's tv series about a mary-sue who is at the same time, mean and bitchy. i couldn't bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of zoey101. not to mention that jamie lynn spears can't act to save her life! what message does this show bring to kids? if you're not perfect like zoey, you're unworthy *rollseyes*.it's absurd how zoey's character is exactly the type of person who would be despised in real life yet she manages to become so popular. then there is chase who is basically a lovesick puppy who worships the ground zoey walks on. then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been dumbed down in order to stop them from outshining zoey. i'm sorry but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.

this was another one of those shows that i watched to root out the positive elements, and because i've been a nick fan for years. some of those would be the stage sets, b-plots, guest stars, and a few of the main actors that were good. i dabbled in the show through high school as i quickly grew to despise jamie spears, along with the other chicks in the show that can't act. the only characters i seemed to like were dustin, quinn, stacey, michael & logan. quinn is a perfect outcast that eventually started to fit in; stacey is a complete oddball; dustin gets put through a bunch of strange, random situations; and michael is kind of the comic relief right-hand man of logan. there's a remarkable difference between the execution & acting quality of the b-plots that involve them, and the a-plots that showcased a bunch of screeching girls and an iconic "miss perfect," repeating bad lines and obsessing over guys. this show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the side plots, but the main plots just don't deliver anything. when it recently came back in reruns, and i tried to watch it again, i was more calloused towards the girls' abysmal acting and had to change the channel. however, i will give the previously listed characters credit because they did make the show more or less worth my time.

i strongly dislike this show. i mean, like, basically everyone at that school is perfect, and rich, and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that. and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school? isn't that just a little weird? anyways, jamie lynn spears cannot act. she always has the same facial expression, which really annoys me. she is basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her.and shouldn't chase tell her he likes her? its not that hard! really! none of this show is real life, and she isn't "a girl like me" because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes, and do not live by the beach.fake fake fake.

okay people, i have to agree with almost everyone else's reviews here. the characters. are. stupid. they're all stereotypical, and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny.don't even get me started on jamie lynn's role as zoey. zoey is a pretty, popular, tan, blonde young teen who everyone just loves! she has a "rebellious", great, personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is. most annoying of all: her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious. "omg!"take for example the first episode. the moment she steps onto the huge pca campus, everyone seems to love her. the boys want to ask her out, the girls want to be her friend, etc. thinking she's all that, the episode plays out with zoey always being the center of attention; she is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team, confident, and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face. oh boo-hoo.my favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show, lauren or something, who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate zoey.and zoey doesn't even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes. in one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without ever apologizing and doesn't show the least bit regret in doing so.zoey is always the best:-desiging professional t-shirts and backpacks (which become a big hit)-coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach a single person a lesson. -flawless grades -taking the blame for stuff that wasn't even related to her just so everyone else could be happy.-coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on tv. the list goes on and on...ugh. she has no acting talent. she's always the perfect person. she acts snotty and rebellious and preppy and...ugh! can't stand her.not only that, but everyone in the show always has great clothes. even the nerd! her wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty freaking decent.no one cares if everyone at pca loves you, zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it meant giving their right arm.but regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. not everyday things. they're interesting and amusing. the humor is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so paper flat that it's hard to enjoy it.this show would be really good if dan schnieder put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that's it's lame and stupid.point: no one's the least bit overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, zoey is the definition of mary-sue, the story lines are well-thought out, and the humor is laughable. but again, i want to emphasize that the characters taint the show. watch the show if you must, but don't say i didn't warn you if your eyes start to bleed.

i actually belong to the demographic zoey 101 specifically is trying to target, so i can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age, the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to. the show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence, and the lovely, incredibly tan, attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. as is the tradition amongst kids networks, the cast is an array of skinny white kids, with the token black guy, of course.the story lines all revolve around zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma, such as not wanting to attend gym class, resulting in zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends. there is generally a b-line revolving around either a one- sided guest character, or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations, such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing. these plots often play off stereotypes, such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills. the majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will-they won't-they chase-zoey dynamic.the characters, unfortunately, are all incredibly one-sided; there is zoey, the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything,chase, the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing best friend, michael, the token black guy (kudos to christopher massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners), lola, the theater chick (meaning she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom, despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater), logan, the womanizing narcissist, dustin, the spazzy little brother, and quinn, the science geek. the few words i spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely.zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times, but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff. zoey, who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless, still manages major character flaws. for example, when lola was first introduced, she was believed to be a goth girl. zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being "freaky".as for the acting, it is quite clear that jamie lynn spears landed this role because of her name, not because of talent. although she has definitely improved as time goes by, it is clear she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, as most of the plot lines revolve around her character. the supporting cast is surprisingly good, especially considering the material they have to work with. they deliver quite a few good one-liners for comic relief, if the plot hasn't yet ventured into obscurity.all in all, zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life, and anyone past their limited too years shouldn't expect much from it.

this show sucks. it was put on fridays on roller-coaster, and whilst it undoubtedly destroyed the running theme of friday programming i shall judge it rationally... still i think it sucks. it really is super lame. zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame. the lame continuuity and pot sucks and i reckon the dialogue and joes are weak. the weak humour and lame sucky characters suck, and the whole show is frankly a disappointment not worth watching. it sucks and is really, really lame. it really has to be one of the lamest shows on tv, really not worth watching. i mean how lame weak and sucky can a show get before it gets axed?

zeoy101?? really, this has to be one of the most stupidest attempts to get people in my age group's attention. it's about some preppy girl named zeoy and her friends that attends boarding school. boring!!! all she ever does is whine and complain and acts like a spoiled idiot. i remember this show came out in 2005, i was 13 going on 14, and even then i thought it was pointless. the only episode i ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls dorm. that's it. anyway, i just don't understand why nickel-oh my bad-nick feels the need to syndicate this sorry poor excuse for "entertainment". serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worst and worst. what's with this generation??anyway, r.i.p. nickelodeon 1979-1998?/2005?

blond main character, always believes in everyone and when you stick together you can do anything! shy guy best friend with curly hair (rip off of gordo) wants to be a movie director has a secret crush on zoey. spanish best friend (rip off of miranda) weird smart girl quinn (rip off of lary tudgemen)and the popular stock up prep logan (rip off of kate)and zoey's little brother max, annoying (rip off of matt)zoey is the semi popular girl, with 2 best friends. the only thing it's missing is the funny little sacastic cartoon lizzie mcguire has, and hillary duff was a lot cuter. jamie lynn spears looks more like a tooth pick in a tube top.

i first watched this show hoping for a few laughs, good acting, and good plot. sadly, i got none of those things.first off, this show is completely unrealistic. how can someone go to a boarding school that's super hip, awesome location, and barely any rules? plus a sushi bar. a sushi bar. no school has a sushi bar. and what's up with the huge, ultra cool, ultra hip dorm rooms? this doesn't happen in boarding schools! everyone in this show seems to be perfect. zoey, looks perfect, has the perfect friends, never has to do homework, and is super popular. sounds more like a villain to me! i hate how they use so many cliques in this show, example: dana the skater chick. she is completely ignorant and wears "edgy" clothes. the jokes are old sooooo old too! i wouldn't watch this show if i were you, it's one of the most horrible shows i have ever watched and i hope it gets canceled soon! rating: 1/10

first, i want to clear a common misconception: it is not unrealistic that the school zoey goes to gives students laptops. at my school, those in grade 7 and higher must have apple macbooks (this is payed for in the entrance fee). moving on. this show is very annoying. it has boring, predictable plots and bad acting. often in the show it brings "girl power" to a new high, with girls beating guys in everything they try. but that is not the worst. the worst is that girls are nevertheless all portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances, and screaming whenever they are happy. except for the one smart girl, who is portrayed as a freak who is obsessed with ugly boys and science. however, this show is very addictive. i do not know why, but it is. although, the most recent season has been so terrible, bringing the stereotypes, boring plots, and bad acting to extremes i never thought were reachable, so i am no longer addicted, thankfully.

imagine this: a high school. except it's boarding school, and the kids don't have parents around. oh, and it's in malibu. and the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the "weird" outcast. and there aren't any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student.here's the story: a girl, zoey brooks, attends pca, a formerly all-boys school. absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. she's the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. too bad none of this makes her likable.are we supposed to believe that if we don't even come close to zoey's perfection, we're bad people? in the show, nothing's her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they're portrayed as the bad guy(logan). he may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.her loyal group of blind followers are: chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes.what ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they're normal kids. they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. wow, they have it hard! any other problems? i'm too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! i guess zoey 101 (what's the 101 for, anyway?) is nick's attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn't like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on the hills.but hey, at least the set's pretty.

i have seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them i was forced to watch. and i did not like the episodes i saw. what happened to dan schneider? after giving us such awesome shows like drake and josh, why did he decide to create a stupid show like this? my problem is not just with dan, it is also with the guys who nominated this show for an emmy, were they drunk that day, or what's the problem? drake and josh didn't get nominated for an emmy, but it's way better than zoey 101. the makers of this show should be ashamed for the existence of this show, let's just hope the pregnancy of you know who will affect the show, or better yet it'll cause it to get canceled.

this television show is stereotypical and far-fetched in many of its aspects.first of all, the setting. all of the characters attend pca, this unbelievable boarding school with painted, stylish dorms. the campus seems to have no reasonable rules - for instance, the boys are often seen in the girls' dormitories, and vice versa. but this may be simply because the dorm adviser, a silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them, as i assume her purpose is supposed to be, sits around and does nothing. i have friends in boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show.next, the characters. i was so disappointed to discover that nickelodeon wasn't creative at all with the personalities in this show. they all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme: zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does (looks, grades, sports, guys, judgment, creativity, etc), michael is the jock, logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers, nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight-a's, dana was the tough girl, quinn is the unrealistic 'smart kid,' whom they consistently make fun of, chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his 'true feelings' which really aggravates me as the show continues, and that new girl- lola or something- is just another clone of nicole.the main two characters that aggravate me the most are zoey and quinn. first of all, i just do not understand zoey's character. she was obviously created to be the 'perfect' character as i said above, but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them- in most of the episodes she creates a problem, then has to fix it. what's frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they haven't even created a very realistic character to begin with.quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting. the impression i get from nick concerning her character is that 'geeks' and 'nerds' are people to laugh at, to criticize, to mock. in the spring break episode they did a year ago, they introduced two more 'nerds' who the characters had to make 'cool.' i found this highly offensive and stereotypical. what kind of message is nick sending to these kids? is it: don't do well in school, don't get good grades, don't study hard- you'll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series! because that is definitely the message i get from these poorly constructed characters, and it is an awful message through and through.all i can do is hope that nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world, they are not doing anyone any good.

the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when i'm making fun of it. jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister, and i don't think anyone could argue with me on that. there is no expression in her face ever (even when she smiles) - just watch the show and you'll see what i mean. now let's talk about the show. zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows i've ever seen! as a lot of people have already said, zoey brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she's a straight a student, and all the boys think that she's "hot." pca is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flat-screen tvs and laptop computers, serving kids sushi from the sushi bar. in one of the newest episodes, zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her, and acts as if she doesn't even want chase to love her. then, when she barges into chase's dorm room to prove her friends wrong, she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca. zoey, of course, freaks out, probably because she likes the attention from chase. anyway, only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101. you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!

for any fan of nickelodeon who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good on. you had entertaining acts like you can't do that on television. you had weird but good shows like pete & pete. you even had cartoons that taught morals like doug. but just like disney, nickelodeon has fallen down the tubes, limiting their demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. as i tried watching zoey 101, i just shook my head in disgust.the setting couldn't of been more fake than this one. each character attends a boarding school called pacific coast academy, boasting everything that a spoiled child wants. a sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen tvs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. the kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers. it looks more like a place that you would spend on a nice summer vacation rather than to work and study while preparing for college.the characters were also a factor that turned me off. every episode consists of boy problems, situations that they caused themselves, and troubles that should be solved. each character is a stereotype. zoey (jamie lynn) seems perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends ask her for help when they feel they are in grave danger. only leading her to have no other side. i've been through school and i can tell you, nobody is like that. chase is dumb. logan plays the arrogant tough guy. quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does. michael is an idiot. lola is a clone of nicole. dana is just well, a tough person. why not use some originality? something that is unique for these characters, and different from other personalities? is being stereotypical the best the creators of this show can come up with? instead, these actors are dull personalities with the sense in that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles. there is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at.not only that, but the show is clearly for the intent of aiming for kids of adolescence, facing a stage in that they must evolve from being a child to being an adult. through that period they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions, and do what's right for them. zoey 101 contains nothing of those values. in this case, we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. i'm sorry, but that simply isn't true. people can't expect things to be handed to them like the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there. if i expect things in zoey 101 to happen in real life, then i would be living in a fantasy world locked away in a dream house. nothing in this show relates to those who face health and money issues. neither does it relate to kids wanting to learn something meaningful.so in conclusion, zoey 101 is a show made by nickelodeon that only falls flat on it's face. it displays a horrible message for kids and i highly think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. sure, it doesn't have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid. a horrible show, and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage nickelodeon has been making in recent years.1 out of 10.

i've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it, the less i like it. jamie lynn spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is britney's sister and i'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious. they've created the character zoey to be everything people want to believe jamie lynn is, clever, original, smart, pretty, popular etc. the characters around her are only there to make her look better, by being smarter then them, more popular than them, more wanted by boys then them. there is nothing original about this and it's poured with money, so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff. i also have to say, for a 13 year old girl (or however old she is, can't be much older) she wears very mature clothing, those short skirts are too short, it makes young people want to wear them, and all that make-up, this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble. the only thing i will say is that the opening credits are sung by jamie lynn and, given her age, isn't bad at all, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability. sorry, it's too mature and yet too dumbed down. it's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too.

shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings. welcome to the life of zoey brooks and her friends. zoey brooks is portrayed by jamie lynn spears, the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star britney spears. with her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent, it's confirmed that nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism. when kristin herrera, the actress who portrayed dana cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress. the female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media. if they continue to pursue jamie lynn spears as the picture of perfection, very many people will have to lower their standards. with hope, they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing. jamie lynn spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career. there is no wondering why she is a self-proclaimed actress. critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that.

this show makes me(and many others) hate their lives. let's face it, zoey is perfect; she's bland pretty, gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she's popular, she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms. reasons why i gave this show a 3: 1. the acting is horrible.sometimes i just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actresses(especially victoria justice) on television. 2. the characters are unbelievable and mismatched. you have your typical popular girl. a peppy, shallow, stupid ,stereotypical, girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress. then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice.then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers. then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier gazing into a mirror all day. then the wanna be actress who is played by another stinky actress. and last a normal nerd person guy. 3. the plot is boring, and lame. 4. i hate how spoiled these characters are. can't they just be normal! 5. everything ends up perfect for them, and we all are reminded of how much our lives stink.

right, where do i start? i cannot even imagine to comprehend this preteen pathetic excuse of a show. picture this: a boarding school, where kids whose parents are rolling in money simply chuck them in there so as to jet around the world themselves. it could not get any more diabolic than this.if you taught these kids, shall not even upgrade them to the term teenagers, because they hardly even act like sane homosapiens, were self-centered, think again. about 23 minutes choked full of their so-called problems, boy troubles, and the like.the heroine of the show, of course, mademoiselle zoey, played by britney's polly pocket little miss i'm all that sister, jamie lynn spears, has obviously much to learn about acting. however, i will give her some face, because her superficial, one dimensional character, does not allow much room for depth. she plays pacific coast academy's sun, moon and stars, crusader fighting for the plight of all women, equality of all genders.perfect in everyway, always with her two loyal sidekicks, nicole, the daffy bimbo, who obviously has too much of daddy's cash, and tough chick, dana, who proves a hard nut to crack. both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that i blame that. but horror of horrors, in comes lola, who deems herself the greatest actress since natalie wood, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. she is even more rude than zoey herself, if that is even possible, and even more dumber than nicole, and hell, we know that cannot be possible.this show, like all the sorry excuses for television programmes nickelodeon has been spewing out since 2000s, is a prime victim of stereotyping. get girl next door and dense to her best friend's feelings for her zoey, a great albeit inarticulate at times best boy friend, chase, a cool, arrogant ladies man, logan, a boy and clothes crazy girl, who is not very bright, nicole, the one whom everyone thinks is weird just because she is extremely smart, the nerd, quinn, the over-dramatic, annoying yet super thin, malibu picture perfect model, lola, and the tough yet soft inside woman, dana. now, where have i heard these characters before? i am sorry, but what is so wrong with having a personality? just because quinn is passionate about science, and actually cares about her future and doing well in the academic aspect, in which the rest should be concerned about as well, she is "weird" and a "nerd"? lola at the beginning of the series, proved to be a potential great character with her sassy ways and different outlook in life, zoey just had to go, get out your pitchforks, burn her at the stake, she's going back to weird town and all that jazz. so much for womens rights. unfortunately, lola just became nothing more of another oc clone, in all its anorexic glory. probably so as to not outshine her mistress.but hey, the 2000 generation of myspace whores seem to love it with the chase/zoey typical fairytale romance, the tension between adamant, "hot" logan and "kick-ass" zoey or dana, whichever to your liking, and the pretty people. please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, shallow and vapid lifestyle. sorry to break it to you darlings, that will not happen, unless you have a major trust fund and parents to cushion you.

when i first watched zoey101 with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage. no one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast. in the show, zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice. zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is. she is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure. and she is such a dietetic freak she talks about carbs like she knows what they are. when she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it. and another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her. and everyone wants something do with her, for example in one episode that logan guy bid $4,000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life. and her friend nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lot.and lola dresses like a hoochie houdini lady. 80s called they want there bushy hair back.might as well shave off the hair chase. this show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they don't have the latest i-pods and designer clothes they will hate themselves. this show is a big thumbs down. we hate you jamie lynn, best wishes ryan, and kara l

this is the absolutely worst show in the history of nickelodeon. first of all, no boarding school has a sushi bar, flat screen tvs, and gives every student a laptop. this makes the show so unrealistic, and boring. the plots are pointless, and incredibly boring. the actors are so bad, it makes me want to take my own life. i really hate the fact that in the show, zoey is the most popular girl in school, and the prettiest, and smartest, and gets the best grades without doing any work. she never has any real problems, and every guy wants to date her. she is so perfect. there isn't anyone like that. also, i hate that everyone would do anything for her, and everyone picks her for every team, or club. it is so annoying. quinn is so obnoxious. her experiments are pathetic, pointless, and fake. chase is such a wimp. he says he loves zoey, but if he told her, it would ruin their friendship. how pathetic. michael tries to be funny, but he never accomplishes anything. nichole is so perky, and screams a lot. she is never seen doing any work, or studying, but she is a straight a student. lola thinks she is an actress, but she sucks (excuse my language). need i say more? i think no. for your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.

i have tried to like this show, i really have, but i can't find a reason why anyone would like it. the story lines are weak, the acting is weak and unbelievable. every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random. and it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for jamie lynn spears to be able to move on to movies. every episode shows zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date. she's always perfect and no one is like that in real life. how can people relate to a character that is just a barbie doll? jamie lynn's acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series. all the show's fans are just young girls who don't know any better. i'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach party - please accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch.

i was looking forward to watching this movie, and it does contain very interesting perspectives from iraqis all over the country, not just in major areas.however, as the film went on, and as it seemed to become increasingly more one-sided, i started wondering who had edited the film. to get several hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes, obviously decisions had to be made.i would have really enjoyed a film that showed how everyday iraqis felt on all sides of the issues, but with the newspaper headlines in contrast to what people were saying, and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end, i thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a pre-conceived bias.it could have been such a great film.

well there's a few things about this movie. everyone should see it. you see the nation of iraq like you've never seen it covered by the media, and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most americans, where the movie has its main audience. however all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie. there were 150 cameras handed out to the iraqi people most all of which view the war and subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the bettering of their nation. and in comparison to saddam it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin. also, netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending out a mass e-mail to its entire roster to see the film. many of the, what should be labeled as opinions played out as facts listed off by the interviewed iraqis are wrong. if one is to review the red cross' records of abu ghraib tortures it wasn't saddam's henchmen who were being tortured it was a fine mix of a 80-90% innocent civilians and 10-20% rightfully detained people. never was it disclosed that any of that 10-20% were saddam's henchmen or curfew violators. in addition the arab world really has never listed 'democracy' as one of their opponents, more correctly it is the usa's 6 billion dollars a year to isreal, our military bases in saudi arabia and our interest in oil. i agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows that same distortion. i'm afraid that the iraqi people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a yankee voice. yes its true that saddam is a puke, and that his removal many see for the best. its true that some iraqis actually get paid a good wage. just as its true that no iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and us corporations do. nor does it mention that 20,000 civilians have died due exclusively to us artillery. still 15% of the country which once had running water and electiricity now does not. nor does it mention that from 1993-2003 un sanctions purposed and authored by the usa government killed over 200,000 iraqi civilians. nor does it mention that democracy in when people decide the government, not a massive war machine that sends the message, 'be killed or obey'. i am afraid that the cutting room floor must have quite a bit of iraqis that aren't so happy with the occupation. just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war. in fact the america, britian, spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy, they turned their back to it when they saw how full their pockets could be. hurray, saddam is out of power, but i'm afraid that no iraqi is yet in power. corporations are in power, the media is in power. read, do your own research, and don't let them blindfold you.

just do a little research on the making of this film. something so simple as a google search. it was funded by the us army and promoted just in time for the elections. it is a great idea, but i'd much rather see a documentary, not something edited by the bush administration and told its reality. the timing of the movie's release, its tone, and the fact that ms&l promoted it, raised questions about the intent of the movie. "according to ms&l managing director joe gleason, he and his colleagues also deliver key targeted messages about the war in iraq to specific constituencies," wrote eartha melzer. "was the left-leaning art house crowd one of those constituencies? is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to propagandize the u.s. population? nobody involved with the film is willing to say who initially put up the money for the film or how they ended up represented by the army's pr firm."

i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this "b-movie" in it's entirety.all i have to say is--- save your time and money!!! this has got to be the worst b-movie of all time, it shouldn't even be called a b-movie, more like an f-movie! because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all of the actors are paper-thin and not at all believable, it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it's almost funny.......almost.the movie is just packed full of crappy one-liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit.this movie is supposed to be geared towards men, but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end. they try to appear sexy in those weird, horrible costumes and they fail miserably!!!even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laughs, but this is just too painful to watch!!

i let a friend talk me into viewing this movie, and all i can say is--i want to kill that friend.that is an hour and a half of my life i will never get back and i will forever regret it.if you've also had the bad luck of seeing this movie you will agree with me that this is absolutely the worst movie ever made, ever!if you've never seen this movie and are thinking of seeing it-- let me save you a waste of time and warn you: do not watch this movie, it sucks!!!!everything in this movie fails, the attempt at comedy and sexiness--it just comes off as stupid, trashy and disgusting. try having women in the movie who are actually attractive and sexy and not fat, ugly and gross to look at!!the acting is laughable as is the writing. obviously, this was made by total amateurs, i can't believe these people were allowed to make such a stupid movie, isn't there a law against that? there should be.there are a whole slew of good "b" movies if you are into that sort of thing, but do not waste you time on this crappy wanna-be movie.peace

this is without a doubt the stupidest movie of all time.i don't know who i'm angrier at--the idiots who made this or my video store for actually carrying this piece of crap!!i can't even begin to name all of the things wrong with this horrible wanna-be movie.all of the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot, and the acting is the worst i have ever seen in any movie-ever!!there is nothing about the script that would appeal to any decent person, in fact i don't think they even had a script, they just made up everything as they went along--and you can tell.the "women" (i.e. men dressed up in drag trying to look like women) in the costumes looked so ridiculous, i guess they were trying to be sexy but--not so much!! especially that old woman-disgusting.there is nothing scary about this movie, the only thing scary is that somebody else might actually rent it and have to watch it.no brain required for watching this, you must be a total loser to want to see this movie.don't forget-- i warned you!!!

i read about this film on-line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received, and viewing the trailer, i decided to check it out for myself. what a disappointment! it starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense, but from there it's all downhill. i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie, but by doing so, they took all the enjoyment out of watching it. those choices combined with the "c.s.i" editing, use of music and montage, lack of suspense, scares, or humor really drag this film down. there's too much foreshadowing and to many "subtle" clues, so when the first twist arrives early on, you already know how the movie is going to end. i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job, other than that i can't recommend this movie.

i was only cautiously enthusiast when renting "all the boys love mandy lane", as i instantly remembered hearing & reading a wide variety of opinions  both positive and negative  in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards videostore shelves. supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years, with non-stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change. okay, the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly reverts to the same old and irritating slasher clichés, and once passed that point even the nifty stylistic trademarks can't save the film from dreadful mediocrity. the opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a moodily melancholic ambiance, which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the "ordinary" level of rudimentary slasher flick. after the sublime intro, showcasing a drunk macho kid miscalculate his jump off a rooftop in order to impress the titular beauty, "all the boys love mandy lane" turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a not-so-unidentified maniac. the film's entire pretentious set-up collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards: we never get a proper explanation why mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers (because she grew up an orphan, perhaps? oh, boo-hoo), the boys soon enough illustrate they'd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the "divine" mandy and the final twist  albeit undeniably offbeat  is just plain senseless. the middle section of is rather boring and doesn't even offer any genuinely horrific excitement (shotgun killings? please!) or authentic rancid sleaze. my generous rating 4 out of 10 entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70's filming style (with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images) and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack. director jonathan levine opted for the classic bobby vinton song "sealed with a kiss" to play during the trailer and end-credits, whereas i initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature barry manilow's cheesy love-song "mandy".

all the boys seem to be sexually aroused by mandy lane. all the girls seem to be jealous of mandy lane. but, nothing seems to become of it, and this viewer wonders why? mandy is beautiful and a magnet to every boy she meets, but we never get to know mandy or any of the characters in the film. mandy accepts an invitation, from her student friends, to go to a secluded ranch. three boys and three girls drink and drug. in the film, the teenagers drink booze like its water, and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip. and, there is absolutely no sex. in the meantime, the teenagers disappear one by one. but, the others are all drunk and high. nobody, including those watching the film, cares or is at all concerned. nobody, including the audience, seems to give a damn. emmet, a fellow student, is the instigator of the entire event. there is a security guard, garth (dashingly and handsomely played by anson mount), who guards and protects the ranch. midway through the film, the killer is revealed, the tension is suddenly released like air let out of a balloon. the events are completely predictable, and the film just completely fizzles out. mandy meets her match, but we don't ever know why--and, at the end of the film, there is still no sex. does mandy hypnotize the boys, or does she simply bore all of the boys and girls to their deaths? this absolutely-confused viewer can only conclude that mandy wishes to get rid of the female and male competition--by killing off the manipulative girls and the nasty boys.is mandy worth all of the attention? the director (jonathan levine) seems to think so, but this viewer does not. the able cinematographer (darren genet) provides some stunning images but, in fact, his focus seems to be on garth, who is quite the stud. not all of the boys love mandy, or do they? if you want to be bored enough to find out how this film winds up, my advice is to sleep midway through film, until you see the temptress mandy and garth's bulging crotch. but, don't wait for anything to happen. yep, you guessed it. mandy remains a virgin, and there's still no sex. i rank this film a 3 out of 10, but not because of mandy. why? because all of the girls love garth, and all voyeuristic eyes seem to be on garth in a compromising position. but unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to get beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. mandy goes to a secluded ranch, and nothing sexual ever happens. the audience is led to horror on a ranch--and cannot help, but wonder why?

how could this get a 6.0 rating? are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days, that when one comes along that has some, and i repeat 'only some', redeeming quality's, we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high? the director has a certain visual flair. no doubt about that. but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story, mood or scares. it had a very slow first act, lazy killing scene's, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist. and what's with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films? do they always have to be this stupid, irritating and so godd#mn superficial. i don't remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland. all things considered, in can't give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating.

the commercials for rat race made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy, but since my boyfriend adores this movie (and the soundtrack), i finally relented and watched it with him tonight. i make him watch david lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff (i recently forced urbania on him), so i felt i owed him an innocuous hollywood product.i didn't want to hurt his feelings, so i saved my bitching for y'alls. yeah, rat race has its moments, but a great deal of it irritated me. let's start at the beginning. rat race was marketed as a "family film," so i was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie. (i can hear it now: "mommy, what does afro whores mean?") this scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a pg-13 movie.and while we're still on the segments in the casino, it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play, within the same time frame, the slots that held the gold coins. what would have happened if they didn't? would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait? and how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place?but i'm belaboring a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist, so i'll press on. about whoopi and her long-lost daughter: they're meeting for the very first time, yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves. why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one? couldn't they have just been, say, a mother and daughter on vacation together? why the business concerning a long-ago adoption? and why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business? did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character trait?this illustrates the main weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; it's exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits. and another thing - the events aren't plausible. oh, sure, the characters can do some quirky things, but the characters themselves have to be believable. take the naked gun (another jerry zucker movie) for example. frank drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is, in theory, possible in his world. (jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of funny, which makes all the difference.) a character in rat race defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have; these clearly aren't real people, so why should i care about them?another problem i have with rat race is a moral one. the characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft. i know, i know, this is just a silly comedy, and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when i saw million dollar mystery, but there's a lot of lawbreaking in rat race, and it bothers me now. and i won't delve into the whole airport-sabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real-life implications of such an action; was that scene funny before 9/11?i'll skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart, the drugging of one's family and the nazis (whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of "seinfeld"), and move on to complain about the acting. rowan atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable; i don't know when i liked a comical character less. and the three oscar winners need new agents. whoopi came off best, but she didn't have much to work with (loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though); kathy bates' part was shrill but mercifully brief; cuba, was...oh, man. cuba, babe, please fire your agent! following instinct and chill factor, this is your third strike (be glad i haven't seen pearl harbor or snow dogs) - it's time to give your '97 best supporting actor oscar back to its rightful owner (edward norton, for primal fear). an actor of your stature has no business running half-naked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite lucille ball impersonator. do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore, or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random?there's other small points that bother me (how did grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast?), but, basically, rat race amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending. they give the money to charity? what kind of ending is that?!? yeah, it's the "noble" thing to do. never mind the probability of cross-promotion/licensing whores smash mouth (do they ever say no to selling out?) putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the new mexico desert, but who would honestly do such a thing? yes, they say it's the journey, not the destination, that makes a trip worthwhile, but there's no journey without a destination. if there was ever an example of a "wrong happy ending," this would be it. what a bummer end to a movie that, despite my nitpicking here, i did enjoy parts of (i confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing - at first i thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall, but he grew to be my favorite).but as far as my boyfriend knows, i found rat race quite funny and charming.

i don't know if i'm wrong or everybody els'es that says this movie is good are, sincerely i just wanna do a favor to people that has doubts about seeing it, renting it or even worse buying it(don't do it really!).the trailers and very early previews might seem fun in some way or another but its not funny at all, it gets to fall in a series of you're-supposed-to-laugh-here scenes that tend to get in really bad jokes, bad very very bad acting, tasteless scenes, cheesy effects; this movie has it all, all wrong that is.as final comment the movie would have been funny due to the basic concept, but believe me is really way far from that.

michael allred's comic book stories, particularly his work on madman, usually are a great deal of fun. "astroesque," allred's no-budget indy film, is the opposite of fun.worst acting ever coupled with truly horrible dialog makes for a brutal cinematic experience. pretty certain allred understands wtf's going on, but he's the only one. daring you to watch the entire mess isn't enough...defying you to watch the entire mess is more on target."astroesque" is some kind of movie tie-in to allred's "red rocket 7" comic book, which, ironically, is mostly unreadable. so if your "astroesque" experience isn't terrible enough definitely track down the over-sized comics and continue the fun.felt sorry for allred, who was totally out of his depth attempting a film. also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of my time and money. please buy my vhs copy, which is available right now on ebay. hurry up.

it was full of plot holes, inaccuracies (doesn't the time-clock stop for injured players or loss of helmets in texas football games?) and not so much redemption (so your dad beats the crap out of you? well, do something right for once and then he will love you and make it all worthwhile).either make the movie about a team and its quest for a championship or make a movie about a player within a team and his personal struggle but instead, this movie tried to do it all and came up more than a couple yards short. the book probably showed the whole story much better; the movie should have picked one element of the story and stuck with that.instead, the movie jumped from one character dialogue to flashes of game play and then another character dialogue months later without actually telling you who people were or why they were important--the qb calling his sibling to take care of the mother--whatever happened with that? because the mother was coherent by the end of the final game, does that mean she's not crazy anymore? its one redeeming quality was the soundtrack. buy that and then watch sportscenter highlights while iggy pop plays in the background.

we'll never know the truth about 9/11. and this shoddy movie proves it.i recently watched a youtube report claiming there were no planes involved in the twin towers' destruction; that all the news programs were supposedly provided with same-angle shots of the towers from a mysterious source (probably the gubmint?), and in that provided footage cgi planes were substituted for real-life missiles which actually hit the towers....it's a compelling video, and though i am not a wacko conspiracy theorist per se, i am still not sure myself whether actual planes hit anything that day (the towers, the shanksville field, the pentagon) - because there is no plane wreckage available. (and what about those infamous "black boxes"? none recovered.) a million other theories abound, all of them courting a droplet of truth awash in an ocean of speculation. but you'll drown in malarkey before you find anything truthful or worth speculating about in the 9/11 commission report, a no-budget movie that is trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have escaped.writer-director leigh scott is obviously a concerned american citizen who wanted to enlighten audiences on what the 560-page report might reveal. it would help if his movie had actors, instead of a guy who looks like david duchovny, a chick who looks like gina gershon, a guy who thinks he's russell crowe and another guy who i'm pretty sure is trying hard to be sean bean. it would help if his camera operator didn't have parkinson's; if the lighting director wasn't trying to save on electricity; it would help if his editor didn't have attention deficit disorder, or if the soundtrack wasn't some tuneless new world order esoterica; and the looping should have probably been inserted when people were actually moving their mouths.we can't even call this propaganda. it's too funny. and by funny, i mean unwatchable.you can't squeeze an issue this complex into a two-hour film, but leigh scott tries anyway, including all those sexy catch-phrases we've grown inured to: bin laden's intent to attack, purchasing weapons from somalia, non-aggression agreement with iraq, mussawi attending flight school, weapons of mass destruction...the problem is: we know it's all retrospect, so every discussion the concerned intelligence operatives have with each other reeks of fake hindsight all crammed into a neat conversation. like contrived reverse engineering, everything pertinent is mentioned succinctly so that we can shake our heads in wonder at how incompetently all these branches of government screwed up.there's a ludicrous interrogation scene with a lubricious bimbo beating up on a guy with tomato sauce on his face. now - that would be considered torture if most guys didn't consider it a turn-on.the tagline is: "what if the attack could have been stopped?" by this movie's account - and, we presume, according to the commission report - the cia and other underground agencies were all set to capture bin laden and didn't. everyone involved with the "terrorism" reports (you mean you actually read these reports?) is so concerned we just want to slap them for their bad acting.yet the whole story goes so much deeper than the banal soundbytes the negligent ku bush klan foisted on the american people after 9/11. we now know that even capturing bin laden before the 9/11 attack would not have changed or achieved anything - the wheels were in motion with or without that taliban figurehead whose involvement was the possible figment of someone's fevered imagination to unite america against a common enemy. contrary to popular belief "they" didn't "attack us." as ron paul tried to elucidate, it was a case of middle eastern blowback - "they" were so sick of america planting their infidel feet "over there" that they brought the war "over here." so though george w. death likes to tout the nonsensical, "we're fighting them over there so we won't have to fight them over here," in reality "because we're over there, the fight has been brought over here." the 9/11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists, as it was the gross negligence of the bush administration, who we know (without the probing of commissions) had all the intel from the clinton administration onwards; information about terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos. but the oil idiot of texas, who refused to read his daily briefings and would rather vacation at his crawford ranch than spend one extra day at work, abrogated the duty he swore an oath to perform - protect the american public.and then the scum who called himself president used the attacks brought about by his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbed-down countryfolk to score a second term, shred the american constitution and take america into a fake war on the basis of a lie (wmd), with a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. strangely enough, the movie never treads near the ku bush klan, offering no opinion or judgment, leigh scott wanting to remain neutral. tell that to the raped and pillaged hundreds of thousands in the fake war on terror in iraq.out of pure coincidence, i realized i was watching this dvd while wearing my "bush lied. thousands died." t-shirt.

am i the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence? i knew nothing about leigh scott when i rented it, and would not have done so if i had known that most of his previous films were horror films. i am not into that at all, i was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report.instead, i got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. the only good thing about it for me, was that it made me want to read the report, to figure out what the heck this movie was about.i wrote this because i am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on tv, that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that i read.

this documentary was very amateurish. it could have been made by college students. assuming that it was, my grading is as follows. content : c, sound quality : f ,cinematography : f ,acting : d, soundtrack : f, casting : c, boobshot : a ......overall grade :di found myself getting seasick as we walked down the streets with the characters,bobbing up and down with each move of the cameraman'step.my mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miracle ear and she could not hear the muffled dialog. extensive post production editing and cgi would not help this bomb. these students would "barely" pass my course.my advise...don't waste your time or money for the one "a".

i survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes, just to say i saw the end. if you want *real* mythology, flawlessly executed, look for armand assante's "the odyssey." great storytelling doesn't need to be tweaked - the stories are fantastic on their own. i only hope sean astin needed the money. and sophocles and ovid must be whirling in their graves - wherever those may be.at least with sorbo's version, the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library.i'm surprised halmi could turn out something so amusing (the tv series), and follow it with something so devoid of quality.

this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology i've ever seen. it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to... 3 or 4, i think. it makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having ever read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the oracle of delphi to tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of sam raimi's entertaining series, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the furies so it sounds appropriate to the period.i could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-shakespearean tripe. it is a poor re-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that crichton's "the 13th warrior" attempted in regards to the beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength. a sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, who i'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply.

i don't know how expensive was the creation of this movie but the effects were awful. half of the movie was filmed on stage in front of a movie canvas (that's sure that blue box wouldn't look so artificial). when they traveled on a boat, the background canvas was moved imitating the movement of waves but the characters weren't moving. the cgi effects: terrible (i am not sure but i guess the effect were created with paint and made a gif sequence of them - next time the creators should hire a professional cgi maker team). it looks like the cgi creator would have drawn on the picture strip with shaky hands. awful, that's sure. when i first saw the trailer, i thought it was created in 1983. one of my friend told me the correct date: 2005. my jaw dropped, i was so shocked, i thought he was kidding. people, i recommend you to skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you won't enjoy it.

eh. i watch this movie in class because someone taped it and brought it in. i was expecting some half hearted attempt to portray the herakles myths, and because the commercials for it looked serious, i was expecting something that was halfway decent.ten minutes into the film, i realized that it was utter crap. the only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the bare(and i mean bare) minimum. parents, half brother, and labors seemed to be named correctly. other than that, the rest of the film seemed to be one giant inaccuracy. i would say that this was not much better than the disney version of the film. the disney version was made for little kids, therefore wasn't too serious. this movie, with all the sex, violence, and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, yet the story presented in this was nearly inaccurate as the disney film.

i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie, and sat through the whole thing. i can summarize by saying it left a bad taste in my mouth.the movie started out ok, i think the initial characterization of herc was true to the myths. both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the brightest bulb. but later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker beloved by all. huh? other problem: terrible cgi. the satyr looked ok, but the rest of the critters just looked terrible, especially the hart, the phoniest looking beast in the movie. and how come leelee sobieski's skin was sometimes golden, sometimes normal? the worst part for me--and everyone should cringe at this--was the twelve labors of hercules. because the producers obviously didn't want to cover all of them; maybe they thought us primitive screw-heads watching this garbage couldn't count that high. instead of the twelve labors of hercules, we got the five labors of hercules. yes, the five labors! wtf?!? he did't even finish the last one, so it was really the 4 1/2 labors! just terrible. i'll take hercules: the legendary journeys over this piece of crap any day of the week.

my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. i was never completely lost, but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.if it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus' followers do or believe. the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons. not unwatchable but also not worth watching.

this is fairly typical for the sci-fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot, and terrible special effects. we've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train, and lou diamond phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a performance. and save the day. everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking lou, then of course comes to love him again at the end. the obnoxious state senator who gets munched early on, and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. then there's an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever, except to provide us with 3% more running around. he spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.the special effects really deserve their own paragraph. we start with a meteorite that flies through the air, trailing flames behind it, at about 100 miles per hour. according to the physics of this movie, if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. then it lands on the hood of a car, coming in horizontally. sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor i guess. it really doesn't damage the car much, just bends up the hood a little bit. later on lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. even though the train only had a two minute head start, it takes a good half hour to catch it. the cgi is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over. then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. it looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter. about 10 times too big. no wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time, it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do, he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off, but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling, so why this would keep them on the train i have no idea.overall, if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing, and it's down to this movie or reruns on the food network, well, come to think of it, some of those chefs are kind of cute. usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl, some t&a, or a character that actually has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. i really didn't see any of that here.

what do you get when you put lou diamond philips, todd bridges, barry corbin with a bad toupee, and an alien all on a train? you get a very bad movie called "alien express" or "dead rail" that would be more entertaining on comedy central's old series "mystery science theater 3000." you name it, this awful movie suffered in areas of acting, plot, storyline, and special effects. in fact, the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common ho scale model in front of a painted background! the rest of the special effects goes downhill from there.the plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970's movies called "horror express" and a disaster movie called "the cassandra crossing." at least "the cassandra crossing" had a better cast, an engaging storyline, and real train scenes.if you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a "b movie" party then watch this; otherwise, "alien express" derailed long before departing from the station!

i am a big fan of sci-fi movies. so, when i saw this movie in the epg, i thought i was in for a pleasant evening. what a disappointment ! such a poor display of "special" effects i could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005 ? come on, why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price (i guess) ? and those killer "muppets"... well, i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage. you can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but i don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. as for the "star" of the movie (i use a lot of quotes tonight...), lou diamond philips, the guy is not even remotely an actor. maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies. all in all, an awful movie. maybe i am in a bad mood tonight. then again, maybe not. a sincere 1 out of 10.

this is a truly awful film. lou diamond phillips simply calls this one in. the use of miniature models of the train are laughable. the plot seems to develop on the run (there is an alien on board; oh, and an eco-terrorist is on board too; oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh, and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead; oh, and that train has nuclear waste on it...). i mean, come on really! the alien monsters are not scary (although there are a lot of them), and the acting is abysmal. check out the guy playing the "next president" - do you really think he could be president? for goodness sake, he has spent his whole acting career playing bad guys!

"eh-heh eh-heh hey, dude - look at these aliens. they're like - biting the humans and stuff! eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh" this must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. it's utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. their reviews are too good. to give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some b-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills.but enough of that.this movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being so bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. the old japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. at least in those 60's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved upwards out of the back. those movies made fun of how bad they were. alien express (aka dead rail) seems to actually think of itself as a good movie - which makes it incredibly absurd.the effects were awful by today's standards. beyond awful. however not quite as bad as the 60's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. the plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as i've ever seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. i won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just wouldn't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). most of the acting was awful; lou diamond phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one.scifi channel is rapidly becoming the "cheap thrills channel", producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot. i can only wonder - why bother?don't bother with this tripe. it doesn't get any worse.

i think this movie was made backwards, first they shoot a whole lot of scenes and action, and explosions, and then the story-writers got to work trying to find a story to tie all scenes up together. this movie is without any doubt the worst movie i have ever seen, your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent script. the movie makes no sense. seriously, even if you are a segal fan there's no reason you should ever want to see this movie, except if you're one of those folks that like to stare at accidents, because this is a horrible accident, and should never have been released upon this world.boran.

lord have mercy! why was this film made? why did seagal and rising star max ryan agree to be in it? the foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mind.the film has an ultra-cheap look to it. like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach. what's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate. the result is a film that just don't look right. the fight scenes are so dull and edited 'discretely' to hide the fact that steven seagal is not in good shape anymore. none of them are engaging or exciting. the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it. the eastern-europe locations (a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down, or non-existent) look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an 'action' film (what action?).and what is the deal with the title? as far as i could tell everyone in the movie was foreign. which one does the title refer to?the dvd is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and in dolby 5.1 sound. neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent. the foreigner is not worth one second of your time. gotta love that tagline tho! 'if they think they can stop him, they're dead wrong.' sheesh!

this movie simply does not work. the action scenes were shot to look stylish but just come out looking sloppy. seagal barely fights and a lot of his scenes are shot from the back ( if you look in some of the scenes it is not even him, but a 100 lb lighter stunt double) the movie is just all around bad!

three words: what a pile..... two words: don't bother! one word: sucked! there are zero reasons to see this movie. even those seagal groupies should shy away from this movie. the martial arts, the typical aikido, are horrible. the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic. the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his "kill move" to his victims. worse yet, is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. how stupid. seagal's acting was plain stupid, but i still give this movie a "6" for acting because of the supporting cast whose "villain" roles were actually quite entertaining.the plot is just dumb. seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill. his character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time - at no extra charge - and nothing stands in his way. not assassins, political leaders, explosions, or even death.i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story. there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it. no one should bother with this tripe.

there are films that are not released in theaters but on video. this one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does. no story, inept violence, over acted, badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film. and i did like and enjoyed some of siegel's other movies.

seagal needs to get back to basics breaking bones and kicking butt. no more of this slow motion crap like foreigner and in the shadows fighting like half past dead. exit wounds showed more of his fighting skills with some wires which was ok but then he went back to b movie directors.

i am a fan of his ... this movie sucked really bad. even worse than ticker! & that movie was bad. it was kind of like they popped it out in a week. looked to be very low budget. only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations maybe, & poor hummh! everything! it just blew.

i usually really enjoy steven seagal movies. they are usually highly entertaining and being somewhat of an adept of aikido, i usually like the way steven incorporates these martial art techniques in the fight sequences.however this film is a really bad movie making effort and it seems obvious to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone direct someone like steven seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and competence.i never saw the end of this movie. i walked out before the end simply because i couldn't stand watching anymore of this bad movie. i am sure that many people also share my feelings.

bad acting? yes, but it was not a surprise. stupid story? yes, so what?but why, tell me, mr director, why all that slow motion crap? fight scenes were bad, really bad, because of slow motion and bad cutting. not because of seagal."what if i just speed this up for 2 seconds and then slow down those next 5 seconds and then... maybe i need to flip the coin to decide?" what were you thinking, mr director???

one of the worst movies i have ever seen. seagal has been acting in several entertaining action movies, but this time this movie really sucks. just stupid killing and really stupid storyline. in addition, seagul looks fat and old.

first: i like s segal! but in this movie, he has hit rock bottom and started to dig!the plot what plot? very strange and unbeliveable plot.the actions way below segals standards!the good parts mr segal is a pro. and shows it. that's it.summary i could write (and have done so) a better script for mr segal. in case you read this stephen, mail me, i'll give you a better script to do a better movie! the only realistic part is the one where... (see spoiler part).spoiler part (stop reading here if you plan to see the movie!) - - - gas leak? wow. disecting a 'black-box'-recorder in a hotel room? i work in the industry, laughable! the bad guy 'get's away', that much is true in life!

imagine this...whenever two people meet in this movie, one of them is shot. the plot just does not exist - it appears that someone shot some action sequences and then tried to put them together to make a movie out of it. if you decide to watch it, you will regret it.

steven seagal's films of late have not exactly been good, but this is by far the worst since the patriot. the plot makes no sense what so ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for who or who is double crossing who. the film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward. even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. most of the blame must lie at the director's feet for not even understanding the basics of film making, but seagal does not get off lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. oh, and i haven't even mentioned how awful the acting is, even by seagal standards. even as straight to video fodder, this is not worth a view even for seagal fans. give it a wide berth!

i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill.watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people. i havebeen always looking forward to seagal-movies and, unfortunately, i was first disappointed by glimmer man, which i found really bad. the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has everacted in. horribly boring, badly edited, wrongest soundtrack and so on! dear reader, do yourself a favor an stay away from this!honestly: stay away!

i like steven seagal but i have not a clue what this movie was about. i am not easily lost with movies but i had no idea who was on who's side.hopefully some of his future movies will be a little better. my wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans, however. :p

can they possibly get any worse than this? probably. but after all steven seagal gets to do what he does. well kind of; this time instead of mortally wounding the bad guys he just wounds them. by reputation of being a bad ass agent seagal is hired to deliver a special package from france to america. but it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and foul up the mission. the fights just don't have enough bite and the big bangs are just big and that's all. anna-louis plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear wooden. also in the cast are: jeffery pierce, max ryan and harry van gorkum. don't put all the blame on seagal for this clunker.

they actually make a big deal out of a scene in which steven hurdles a 3 foot fence. the plot is...barely there, the acting (so to speak) is distressing and the action is catastrophically lame. this is the worst seagal film ever, and that is saying something.

since i'm from norway (one of the top ten (or so) richest countries in the world), it was much fun to watch how we use trucks from the 50ies and live in cottages from the medieval times. and since we have very strict laws when it comes to handguns, it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in norway during the five minutes of the shooting there. mr. direct-to-video even managed to bring his silencer on short notice, so he must have powerful friends in the customs.please do at least _some_ research before going to an "exotic" country, dudes -- you may hurt the feelings of old fans.sverre -- old fan with hurt feelings.

if i could have given this film 0/10 i would, and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low. its worse than awful. if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it (at least minimum wage). some of the camera shots were quite effective, but a lot were rubbish eg. villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side-ways from his body (seeing is believing). several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions/facial expressions when they were shot. i only watched it to the end (fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue) hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat, but there was almost none of that (should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of 'action' scene). in one scene we see seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact). the chief villain keeps coming back to life. he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd/3rd floor onto the street. to sum up, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. it looks very low budget (even for seagal). the colour is dull and grey. i could go on and on....just like this film, but i wont. watch this film if you've got insomnia. its guaranteed to put you to sleep.

i saw that "the foreigner" was ranked in the "bottom 100" movie listings here on imdb, so i wasn't expecting much when i tuned into it on the usa channel a week back, but i did have hopes. "belly of the beast" (which aired a month ago) was a mess, but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout, so i thought that this movie might have some of the same. alas, this movie fails the standards of basic watch-ability in almost every way. the screenplay comes off as the bastard offspring of a john lecarre novel and a richard ludlum movie, but done by people with none of those worthy writers' talent for plot and characterization. instead what we got is a glum, mean-spirited, nihilistic, cryptic mare's nest of muddled motives, tangled alliances and back-shootings. and chest shootings. and bombings. and eviscerations. this carries over to the directorial style, which relies on hackneyed 'grainy shot/slow motion' shots every 10 seconds, along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts. these filmic devices that were stale 10 years ago when mtv directors used them for whitesnake videos, and the director works them like a punch press, hoping to inject some weird art-house techno thriller coolness into the proceedings. segal himself is just awful in this. he spends the entire film talking in a hoarse, throaty half-whisper and alternating between two expressions: looking like he is sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small turd under his nose, or looking constipated. and he's so chunky (and vain about it) that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera. i understand that it's hard to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages (although denzel washington and paul newman never seemed to have that problem). but you deal with it by being honest about it, and by growing as an actor, not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length robes. so i can't really tell what's going on, and the movie doesn't give me a reason to care about what's going on, and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing. not a recipe for a good movie experience. oddly, most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking; in fact, if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasn't a close-up of seagal, you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lighting,colors, and composition and by how beautiful the eastern european settings are. but dressing up a rotten egg as a faberge egg can't make it edible. and the proceedings are rotten at heart. there are 'cool' movies (like "versus"), and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies (like "underworld") and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers (like "the bourne identity" and its remake with matt damon). and then there is this thing, which can't make up its mind what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things, and fails because it has no guts or soul. this is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget, so you can't really put it in the same class as "manos", "killer shrews" or "hobgoblins". but i'd rather watch all three of those movies back-to-back several times than watch "the foreigner" again even once.

it just so happens that ivan the terrible, parts i and ii both had entries in the 50 worst movies book by harry medved. now, i do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty poor films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and "googly eyed looks" than i have ever seen before!! director eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film "artsy and profound"--and since i am legally sane, i must say that i hated this first film!! the second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! while part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that ivan's life story is left very incomplete. even without all the truly awful behaviors of ivan, apparently the supremely evil stalin still didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing stalin as a crazy guy just like ivan! by the way, there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with prince vladimir at the banquet! it is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. and, the scene was done in a russian version of 2-color technicolor. this is very odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. so, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. very odd indeed for the 1940s.

butter battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms race. it is also as misguided allegory about the cold-war and arms races in general. yes, it is a children's book, but like so many of theodor seuss geisel's works it hits people over the head with its moral.and that moral is what, exactly? sure it is laudable to encourage us to concentrate more on what unites us than what divides us. it is even a good thing to encourage international cooperation. but to equate the differences between the warsaw pact nations and the nato west to a difference in butter application is just plain wrong. to point out the obvious, many warsaw pact nations enjoyed intermittent periods of shortages of butter and bread -- they would have been happy to eat it butter sideways if it were available. on a less literal level, and whatever your political inclination, soviet socialism versus western (particularly anglo-american) democracy is not a mere question of preference and custom.to make the point even clearer, nuclear weapons were not developed in a cold war with the soviets, but in a hot war with the axis powers. there is no doubt that germany was developing nuclear capability during the war. should the us have refrained from nuclear weapons research putting their trust in their (less than inevitable) victory in the conventional war? once the weapons were developed they were used against the enemy who attacked us at pearl harbor. what does a nation do at this point when the genie is out of the bottle? furthermore, hindsight is 20-20, which is to say that there was no way of assuring another half crazed dictator wouldn't crop up with his eyes on developing nuclear weapons. the second gulf war has shown the incredible difficulty in ascertaining credible threats and neutralizing them.in any event, the cartoon is little more than simplistic propaganda which does little to explore the nuances of the ethical questions behind nuclear armament and instead tries to inculcate fear of weapons technology into children.

this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen. the part where they loose there daughter? with the poltergeist overtone rip off? just pushes it over the edge with stupidity. i watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft-core porn scenes in it. i have to say it made me laugh my ass off. the 80's 3d effects were very out of place. included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex. wow i wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life. the actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow. her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired nazis. anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie. i will always enjoy the time i watched the biggest waist of time and money i have ever seen.

i saw this film one midnight and i can say that it worse than other horror film about a haunted house.alexandra paul is not one of the best actress but she can do the role better,the little girl get worse this is a example about a bad actress,she has not got future in the great world of films. sentence for house of the damned:bad

"house of the damned" (also known as "spectre") is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks, filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. it is about a family that inherits an old irish mansion, and after moving in begin to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the mansion's basement. the couple's young daughter is then whisked away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help.the ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film "poltergeist" are obvious. i will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences, but it is sometimes very, very boring. the acting here is nothing special, the mood is alright, the score (which was mostly this dramatic irish opera music) was somewhat annoying, and the cgi special effects are really horrible. i mean, it was 1996, you would think they could have done a little better than they did. the ending where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect i've seen, very very cheap. but hey, this was a cheap movie.also, the translucent monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks horribly fake. and what was it's significance in the film anyway? what the heck does a wolf-monster have to do with a haunted house? the special effects in here are what really ruined this movie. the acting was pretty bad too. i usually enjoy many low budget horror films, but not this one. "house of the damned" is nothing special at all, only consider watching it if you have nothing better to do. but you'll probably want to pass on it. 4/10.

strange things happen to americans will (greg evigan), maura (alexandra paul) and their young daughter aubrey (briana evigan, greg's real life daughter) when they move into a large, newly inherited house in ireland. crusty corpses are found in the cellar, a turkey squirts blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady show up to scare the little girl. paranormal investigators are eventually called in to banish the evil spirits, but maura becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone around with a meat cleaver.this film is full of cliches, but there's a standout performance from alexandra paul... too bad it doesn't belong in this movie (nor any other i can think of off hand)! she can barely keep a straight face and her over-emoting and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to behold. in any case, she's a lot more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie.score: 3 out of 10

new year's day. the day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and i discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of january. we had a choice - do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of x-files on dvd that we received from our daughter for christmas?we elected for the digital freebie since the dvds are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the x-files beginning to end. the drive-in channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon: asylum (1972), house of the damned (1996) and the pit and the pendulum (1961). asylum is well-reviewed here and the pit and the pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for house of the damned.to be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - greg evigan (william shatner's over-written tekwars) and alexandra paul (the only baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). unfortunately, we soon dissolved to giggles, under the influence of a little hair-of-the-dog, as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: poltergeist, the shining, hell house, house on haunted hill, ghost busters!the acting, especially by evigan's real-life daughter, wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with. the cgi, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and i dissolved in laughter.overall: acting 4/5, script 2/5, sfx 0/5

like the above poster, i got burned on the title thinking i was getting the other piranha... this movie is everything the above poster said and worse... poor camera, lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline...there was very little here that was even worth watching... how this movie even got released is beyond me. make sure the movie you buy is the one you want... and not this one.the movie i bought was labeled "piranha" and not "piranha, piranha!" which is what it actually is... this is the only way they sold this movie at all.peace out.

why bother, itv? admittedly, mansfield park is the most difficult of the novels to "get," and fanny is certainly the hardest to like, but... if one is going to take it on, then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit. and for heaven's sake, have the guts to cast fanny as she was written: a prissy, good-hearted, sweetish, whiner! mrs. norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been. and what the heck happened to portsmouth? the contrast between fanny's rather dubious family and family home and the splendors of mansfield is key to, well, so many aspects of fanny's refusal of henry, her uncle's rejection, henry's near transformation to a good person, etc., etc. again, given the complexity and challenges of the novel, why did they bother? it's beyond me...

this was just telecast here in the u.s. others have commented on the faithfulness (or lack of same) to the novel; the 1983 bbc version is far superior on this and all other counts. given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. key sections have to be rushed or alluded to, or omitted; there barely enough time just to get in the chronology of events, so character development has to be sacrificed: we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are, which robs us of what makes austen so great.one major negative for me was the cinematography, which i thought was just awful, and quite literally sickening. the camera is constantly doing ultra-closeups, and swirling around and around in circles. maybe on a small tv box this is ok, but on our 40" hi-def screen it was so literally dizzying that both my wife and i had to look away from the set repeatedly (my dramamine supply had run out). of course, this did distract from the rather lackluster i'm-just-reading-what's-in-the-script acting (isolated scenes are nicely done, but not enough to save things).adding up the score so far in the complete j.a. sweepstakes: i'd rate "northanger abbey" a success, because of superior direction and production values (and the story lends itself better to short treatment), "persuasion" ok (though not the equal of other versions, with condensation again being at fault), both far ahead of this attempt. i will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this tv reader's digest jane austen; like others, i am thankful they left p & p alone!

please...if anybody gets the chance to read this before watching the movie, if it can be called so, refrain from it... do not waste your time!!!! i too watched this film right after finishing the book, and was seriously disappointed... the main character is basically a new made up fanny, for she shows no resemblance whatso ever to the book...she's so lively and laughing all the time... if there was one thing the author wanted to set on this was that she was a very shy, introverted character.... please!!!!! all the most important parts of the story, which are supposed to convey to the heppy ending, are simply not taken into account...and the rest made up!!! i think one is better off using the time to either read a little bit of the actual novel or simply do nothing.

... when we all know, no one does it like the bbc.being an avid fan of this sort of sunday night watching, i was quite looking forward to this. how disappointed was i! in the first thirty seconds i didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch.however me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. the plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style. this modern style may have been able to be placed within sharp camera angles and visually sumptuous cinematography but unfortunately we got neither. the direction felt decidedly sloppy for both acting and shot choice.after 30 mins we couldn't bare to watch it and went out and rented 'the prestige'(which is very good btw) maybe it is unfair that i judge this as i have watched so little of this, but rarely have i felt so compelled to warn people not to watch something! however, me and my friends did think that the house and parasols were pretty- but thats as good as it gets.

staten island filmmaker andy milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than ed wood. and with this as a dim example of his output i'm apt to agree with them. in "the ghastly ones" we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home (located on a conveniently secluded island) to collect an inheritance. there they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murder/mystery fashion with a scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop. the film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialog is otherworldly bad, there's some primitive mannequin gore (plus some dismemberments and guts) and it's technically inept in every possible way it can be inept. but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way? sort of. it's excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion. approach with caution. if you're not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one.

take a bad script, some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get? something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewing.seven alone is the story of a family in the 19th century who travel across america in a wagon train, hoping for a new life in oregon. there are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex i'm not quite sure of) hence the title of the film.the story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere. eldest son john is a precocious teenager, 'lazy and good for nothing' as his father constantly reminds him. we see right off the bat that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties string to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects it to a nearby mule. when the mule is moved of course the poor girls are jolted out of bed. john is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a strap.that same day a wagon train passes through. pa is tempted to join up as it promises a new life in the wild, wild west. so the family hitches up their belongings and head off.from the very beginning the film seems weak and amateurish. the acting is below grade, as if from one of those films shown in school about the pioneers. i can't blame the actors, however, because the lines in this film are silly and just too sickeningly sweet and optimistic.i must tell you that i caught this film while flipping channels one boring saturday afternoon on a christian television station. not of a religious mind myself, i watched in horror as seven alone offered up moral statements that were not only outdated, but downright offensive! if i were a good christian i would hope that i would have had the good sense to complain to the television station for airing such trash. however, because i am a cynical, non-believer with a wicked sense of humor, i chose to sit back and laugh myself silly.in one of the opening scenes, the role of the father as the stern ruler of the house is established when he proposes the idea of heading off for oregon to his wife. her response is a heated "over my dead body." we are expected to laugh, i suppose, as the film cuts to the next scene with pa and ma smiling as he steers the wagon along through the prairies. oh i suppose even the most staunch feminist would have to admit that this 'father-knows-best' attitude was the norm in those days, and one could argue the need for such dictatorial rule when living conditions were difficult, but i somehow got the feeling that this film supported that notion, even for today. lovely message coming from a christian television station.anyway, things get worse for the family, and the films moral integrity is further diminished. an indian (or native american) robs john as he lay sleeping in a field. like a common savage, the indian takes johns clothes and belongings. thankfully pa, with the help of passerby kit carson, is able to kill the indian, as well as a couple of his delinquent friends. kit carson tells john that his father is a true hero.the family is accompanied by the wagon train's resident doctor, dr. dutch (played by aldo ray). he shares pa's sentiments about john, stating that he is a useless brat. perhaps so, but he also the best thing about this film. aldo ray's doctor is buffoon, who seems unable to tie his own shoes, let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg. thankfully the young child didn't cry when the wagon ran over and snapped her leg in two, because dr. dutch didn't seem to have the appropriate bedside manner. we know the drawbacks of constantly belittling a child. here's a film that promotes that behavior.later on pa develops food poisoning, or something, i wasn't paying much attention, and he dies. his death bed scene is the stuff great acting is made of. frankly, the man didn't even look sick.soon after, ma dies too. the children are left to fend for themselves. and that's when the real adventure begins. slugging it through the rapids, encountering more indians (these ones are nice though) and venturing through snowy terrain, these children do it all. and i was left thinking, "what a bunch of garbage!"sorry, but there was nothing redeeming about this film. this low-budget little house on the prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to 'families' everywhere. i'm surprised that in 1975, at the tail end of the feminist movement, and at a time when treatment of native americans was coming into focus, that something like this could actually be made.

seven pioneer kids strive independently across many miles of indian territory and harsh weather to reach oregon.according to history, young'uns who traveled by themselves through long distances of land - such as with the 'children's crusade' - were manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery, but these kids are pretty tough and they try their best to prevail in accomplishing their goal of making a homestead out west. film is a little too syrupy at times, but ok for fans of 'the waltons' and 'little house on the prairie'.dean smith gives a cool performance as 'kit carson'.

i bought this movie for 99 cents at k-mart several years back (along with "hawken's breed") figuring anything with gabriel byrne and amanda donahoe is surely worth that much. it wasn't. "dark obsession" (the title i bought it under) was a slight cut above "hawken's breed" (imbd rated at 2.4), but not enough to allow me to even keep it in the house. i threw both movies in the trash.this thing fails on so many levels it's hard to narrow it down, but let's just say it's tawdry, incredible, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even at 100 minutes, way too long.i love byrne as an actor, but this schlock really looks bad on his resume.

extremely slow movie.there are fine performances from all actors which is why above 5 score.surya and jyo are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we are shown this till it gets to a point you start asking is there a story.then one day jyo discovers surya's diary to find his failed college love story .the college love story is totally unconvincing as surya is an arrogant senior who is always picking on bhoomika, beats up her friend, yells at her in public and despite being terrified of him she falls in love for him.even after that he continues to dominate her using crude language.i certainly could not appreciate the meek character played by bhoomika, i don't think any self respecting woman will fall for such jerks in real life.so jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after that is the climax. the story is extremely weak in its characters.a extremely arrogant surya to bhoomika is the exact opposite with jyo( and there is no reason given for the sudden change in character).again a extremely meek bhoomika becomes a big extrovert when she returns.wonder, if she had turned so super confident why didn't she try to find her love as she no longer feared anyone.

this film's a big bore. it has a plenty of predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. it starts good with a classy number but seems lost midway.surya & jyothika's on screen chemistry works out really good & a good part by bhoomika. why include vadivelu in it? he disappears totally after a good half an hour!. santhanam proves his wit again by timing comedy.ar's tunes sure will last for sometime. but he could have done better. what ever be the drawbacks still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time-pass.

well, after the hype surrounding the film and after surya labeling the film as path-breaking, i went into the theatre expecting something big. boy was i disappointed. first of all, the characterizations in the film are so weird! which wife would do what kundhavi (jyothika) did? an idiotic, coo-coo one? and what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child (baby shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? what was the purpose of that scene anyway? to start a vulgarly shot "maaja maaja"? not only was the song not canned aesthetically, it was just not needed in the screenplay. not needed at all! secondly, the first half of the had practically no story. the entire first half was a freaking drag. every scene in the first half of the film had no significance what so ever to the real story of the film. and also, how did aishwarya (bhoomika chawla) change so radically all of a sudden? and how did gautham (surya) and kundhavi lead a happy live together after six years even though they were so unhappy about marrying each other? and if gautham did love aishwarya like he claimed he did, why did he even marry kundhavi even if it was his uncle's death wish? why? that's the question you keep asking whilst watching the film! and how fair is the ending to aishwarya? after all, she was gautham's first wife? krishna, the director of the film, claimed he worked on the script of this film for two years, but his script is filled with flaws and leaves the audience utterly irritated! thirdly, krishna's un-imaginative picturizations of rahman's awesome is just disappointing. surprisingly, anthony's editing (usually superb) for the "new york nagaram" song just sucks! the whole song looked like it was a slide show made on microsoft power point! "munbe vaa" rangoli chorus was wasted showing gautham playing football!!! who wants to see the freaking dude playing football during such a beautiful chorus?!? whats more, the whole movie only needed two songs. munbe vaa and kummi adi. the rest of the songs inclusive of "machakari", "maaja maaja", "new york" and "jillunu oru kaadhal" are just not needed. rahman's fine efforts are simply wasted on a stupid film directed by an amateur director! fans of rahman, you ask why rahman keeps moving to bollywood. after looking at the way his songs are picturised in kollywood, why would he want to stay here? what's more irritating is that after krishna decided to include machakari into the film, the song was cut by half which truly, truly annoyes.surya looks handsome in his new get ups save the ones during the college scenes and packs in a so-and-so performance. his expressions during all the songs he was featured in really do not fit the way the singer sings the songs. was jyothika even acting in the film? all she did was cry! would you call all that crying acting? one of her worst performances ever! what's more, her new hairstyle does not suit her. she looked way better in vettaiyaadu vilaiyaadu. her costumes during the "new york nagaram" song are way off. bhoomika chawla is just gorgeous during the film and does justice to her role. vadivelu's comedy is annoying. when one is watching him, one wishes they could slap him on the face. it is santhanam who is the show stealer during the comedy scenes. and why the heck did sukanya even agree to do such a minuscule role which could have done by just anyone? and why is her make up so heavy when she has perfect complexion? music by a.r. rahman is just awesome. "machakari", "munbe vaa", "new york" and "jillunu oru kaadhal" deserve special mention. r.d. rajasekhar's cinematography is ok and isn't as good as his previous films though the scenery during the "kummi adi" song deserve special mention. anthony's editing is really really disappointing. the film is just so freaking draggy and could be trimmed severely.krishna's direction just sucks. dialogues (a.c. durai and krishna) are just too corny to digest especially the part where bhoomika professes her love for surya. the screenplay and script (krishna) are horibble. the film moves in the more un-interesting pace ever. and krishna's script is just filled with unexplained sub plots.and for goodness sakes, why was there so much advertising in the film? pepsi, maggi, suzuki, you name it. was the producer of the film (k.e. gnanavel) low on budget or was he just desperate? overall, jillunu oru kaadhal is a damp squib. with a title like that, one would expect a heart warming and cooling love story but what you end up is a painfully botched up love story. really, really disappointing.

i acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it i found that even the mighty imdb didn't have it listed. that should have been all i needed to know.with friends like these is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate twilight zone / outer limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film. of the three stories, the only one that i gleaned any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man (of sorts) grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge. this episode wins points for a few spots of humour and it's bizarre premise. other than that there is an episode with a talking car (bland and directionless) and an episode where a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog guessed the ending of this one).as has been mentioned in other comments, the 18 rating is entirely unwarranted. there is nothing to offend here. if you're after a good horror anthology check out asylum or the creepshow films instead.

my grandad gave me this dvd. with friends like these. the front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it. what a bloody mistake.basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends.the first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. the second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge. and the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm.the dvd case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained. the film should be rated 12 for slight scares and the swear word bloody.all in all this film is utter shite don't go near it.

with a cheap pound shop having just opened,i thought that it was worth looking to see if their were any cheap dvds that looked good.and while the back of the cover made this sound like a jeepers creepers type of film,it is actually an anthology film! and thought one or two of the stories feel very familiar.its still a fun light horror/comedy. the plots:story one:the classic.a young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a $1500 car.but,when the guy goes to pick a car,a car starts to talk to him.the car (called banns) says that to get everything that he has ever wanted in life,that he must buy baans for $5000.so while the guys relationship crumbles,baans does everything he can to show who really is in charge.story two:kitchen culture.a guy that might get thrown out by his land lord,due to how messy his flat is,discovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in his fridge for six months,the it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself!.and while they start off as friends,they end up having a big falling out,the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive.story three:too good to be true.a girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her.but she is unsure that the guy is too perfect,and when she thinks that she sees him 'shut down' she starts to get spooked. view on the film:the first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england,where it has been given an eighteen rating,even thought it has no nudity,swearing or blood at all.and the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings,where the goodies win!.and while the first story is too close to the stephen king classic christine,the second story is easily the highlight of the film,with director tom parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low-budget muppets episode!.final view on the filmwhile it does have a bit of a 'remake; feel,their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror 'comedy'.

this is perhaps the most ridiculous crap i have ever watched. three unconnected stories about completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about relationships by a stupid man. christ knows why so many people got involved in this. highlights: green fridge man reading jean-paul sartre, the slob mans dinner guest and her horse-manure hair products, a ridiculously unreasonable woman in the third short, who suspected a man of foul play just for taking an interest in her generic activities, blowers.i need to use up a few more lines apparently, so may as well mention some more stupid things about the film. the first film involves a man driving a talking car around and obeying its unreasonable demands for absolutely no apparent reason. the only way you would watch this film is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain. it is kind of funny in an ironic way, but also extremely wearying, like being forced to chew for a very long time on a stained rug.

its hard to decide where to begin.i bought this for a few quid and its the worst few quid iv ever wasted. the back of the dvd had no pictures and a few lines plot summary, this should have warned me, but i usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go. the movie is made up of three short stories,each revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one point.(its never made clear what the significance of the bus is, or what city its set in)possible spoilers(as if there is anything to be spoiled) the first story is about a man who is persuaded, by a car, to purcahse it, against his wife's wishes.the car is sort of like a demonic brum and takes over his life.the second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacteria man grows out of it.the third about a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to discover her date isnt all that normal.inbetween these, we are treated to shots of the bus(or a bus anyway) while a narrator whittles on a load of garbage about relationships(really,its like he is on commission for saying 'relationships')the movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoever.the acting, the costumes and the little spfx are all disgusting.there arent even any attractive female cast members to admire.simply put, this movie is a debacle.

this is a very strange film, with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. it uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of creepshow in that it introduces a trilogy of so-called "horror" shorts and blends them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus. there is a narrator who prattles on about relationships, but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion. as for the stories themselves, well.. i swear i have not got a clue why this movie got an 18 certificate in the uk, which would bring it into line with the likes of nightmare on elm street and the exorcist. nothing here is even remotely scary.. there is no gore, sex, nudity or even a swear word to liven things up, this is the kind of thing you could put out on children's tv and no-one would bat an eyelid. i can only think if it had got the rating it truly deserved (a pg) no serious horror fan would be seen dead with it, so the distributor probably buffeted the bbfc until they relented. anyway, here are the 3 tales in summary: 1. a man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his fiancee. 2. a man who lives in a filthy apartment is understandably freaked out when a living organism evolved from his six-month old tuna casserole. 3. a woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service.. that is until he starts to act weird.. and there you have it. some of them are pretty amusing due to their outlandish premises (my favourite being number 2) but you get the feeling they were meant to be a) frightening and b) morality plays, unfortunately they fail miserably on both counts. to sum up then, this flick is an obscure curiosity.. for very good reasons.

cates is insipid and unconvincing, kline over-acts as always, as does lithgow while butchering an english accent (at least, i assume that's what he's attempting), and the tone staggers uneasily between farcical and maudlin. as with most pet projects showcasing a celebrity couple, it's a relief when this shoddy piece grinds to it's forced and jarring conclusion.

story of an ex-navy seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art russian sub with a nurse. this is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew. the sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. so we see the duo try and gain control back. and this happens with the fear of the us naval forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. a couple of unexplained scenes towards the end. watch it when you have the time. nothing to miss out even if you let the show run while you go get yourself a cup of coffee: slow moving.

this was touted as a sequel to crash dive, which was a very good film in the low budget category. i assumed this movie would be good also, but boy was i wrong. first, this movie has nothing to do with crash dive other than they both take place on submarines. secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases, totally preposterous.this movie will not hold most people's attention. (i remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) there will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud. the corkscrew scene is definitely one. after i got over my initial shock that anyone would slip this in and not know people would not only disbelieve it but laugh at the sheer silliness of it, i was able to find humor in it.if you want to see md in a good sub flick, watch crash dive and leave this lame film on the shelf.

the movie has a good story line, the action is good in some parts, but not all of them. some of the parts, i just felt like the bad guys wouldn't have dosed off yet, from my experience from taking martial arts. some are the actions are long, like always mostly for the boss, but for the least important ones, they were killed or dosed off with a few hits, but some where quite unrealistic or could have done a better job at.the least important actors or stunt people were the right picks for the movie, my girlfriend started to have a crush on them that she started to watch the movie more than she spends her time with me.the movie is good, that is all i can say.

i rented this tv movie version of 'troilus and cressida' out of my library last thursday, and simply could not believe my eyes. where should i begin? no effort was made to make the play look remotely like it was about the trojan war, all the actors were wearing elizabethan dress. moreover, most of the actors were too old and horribly miscast - aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than nestor, troilus was at least 30, hector looked like a spanish pirate, ajax was badly played anyway and thersites was a transvestite.likewise the action is poor, the duel between ajax and hector is short and amateurish, the camera angle focuses more on nestor's face, so we can only see what is going on in the background which is frustrating in itself. nor is the 'battle' at the end given it's due respect. we do not see troilus and diomedes fight, nor anyone else for that matter, paris and menelaus just seem to mud wrestle in front of thersites. even patroclus death was omitted. all this was a major disappointment considering i waded through a very dull 2 and a half hours of bbc costume drama to get to that point.nonetheless, it wasn't all bad. i thought the incredible orlando as thersites and john shrapnel as hector were well played, even if they didn't look quite right. i'd say the same about kenneth haigh as achilles, since he didn't have the striking countenance and was a bit dry at times. spoiler: the climax at the end - the death of hector - was perhaps the best part of the film, achilles' dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold, seasoned murderer. however, the gruesomeness of the scene (when achilles stamps on what was hector's head)sets it apart anyway.charles gray as pandarus was delightful as a sleazy old pervert and i thought the actress playing cressida did an ok job. the war-mongering troilus, however, was annoying and i think that the play would have been better perhaps if he had been murdered by achilles instead of a peacenik like hector.conclusion? ok, but could have been better if it had had a younger cast and costumes that at least attempted to look ancient grecian, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10

the final entry in the on the buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in wales. i feel sure the franchise could have continued, but harold pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison, and so no more were made. it's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism - a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever. still, it does at least make stan (reg varney) laugh - but then what doesn't? he and jack (bob grant) spend the entire movie laughing uproariously with little or no provocation. you get the impression that they'd wet themselves watching paint dry. as before, the only funny element is the genuinely amusing stephen lewis, hilarious as blakey. he's on his own, though, with a cheesy, dated script that even wastes first-rate talent like wilfrid brambell and henry mcgee. yet it seems as if only lewis understands how to time the shaky material, wringing laughs out of even the weakest lines. describing how her daughter fell in a river, stan's mum laments "i hope it's not polluted." "well it will be now" blakey quips. the plot - if indeed there is one - sees stan lusting after a young girl, but being continually thwarted by her domineering mother. it's a recipe for side splitting hilarity i'm sure you'll agree, and whether it's on a storm-lashed boat or the swimming baths, stan and mavis's exploits always produce the same result... abject boredom. later conquests include maria, an italian stereotype, and a staff co-worker. even stan's mum gets a one-night stand, with stan considerately reminding her to "put your tin drawers on."when one of the comic "highpoints" is arthur mullard overhearing olive trying to locate a light switch in the dark ("i can't find it") and thinking she's talking about sex, then you can see why this work reaches the upper levels of literary sophistication. in fact, why it didn't get in the bfi's top 100 movies is beyond me. other rib-tickling shenanigans involve olive (anna karen) breaking her glasses. i don't know what's more surprising, the lame predictability of the set-up, or the underdeveloped pay-off. the short sighted olive follows a man in a kilt into the gents, thinking he's a woman in a skirt. the next shot sees her marched out by blakey and redirected to the ladies. and that's it. next, she ends up in another man's bed, and is ordered out by his wife. and... no, that's all there is to that scene, too.when holiday on the buses was last screened on british television there was a breakdown in transmission. it actually came as blessed relief.

the problem this film has is the same problem the tv series had and that`s the laddish stan and jack . there`s nothing wrong with laddish characters but stan and jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s/ early 50s ! and there`s something objectionable - not to mention crediblity defying - as they cop off with girls young enough to be their daughtersas for the rest of holiday on the buses , i found it instantly forgettable . it`s basically a 30 minute episode spun out to 90 minutes with having all the action take place at a holiday camp instead of a bus stationamazingly almost a third of voters on this site have given it a 10 ! come on guys , this film doesn`t deserve more than a 5

this has got to be the most appalling abuse of the word comedy ever witnessed.it is simply not funny and the scriptwriters have obviously just tried to use the name of the tv series in order to make a few quid at the box office. this film makes a carry on seem subtle as far as sexual innuendo goes ( no mean feat), and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis. a complete washout i'm afraid!!

this movie is a window on the world of britain in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, fags and birds. i was actually at pontins prestatyn while this was being filmed, so it's fascinating to see where i holidayed as a kid, and what a world we have left behind. the 'plot', such as it is, concerns stan and jack's attempts to turn a job at a holiday camp(25 quid a week!) into an opportunity for chasing young women and winding up blakey. they are joined by the rest of stan's family and some laughs are to be had from arthur (michael robbins) and olive's (anna karen) persistent chuntering, as well as the sheer oddness of blakey, but the idea that young women would see anything desirable in brilliantined stan (reg varney) or lecherous jack (bob grant) is just risible. harmless enough in its time, now it's just a curio from a bygone age.

the 3rd and last big screen spin off from the very popular itv sitcom of the early 1970's,holiday on the buses is every bit as resistible and crude as the previous two efforts,and observing from a standpoint three and a half decades later,it is truly mind boggling that even one film was produced in this franchise.what constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of stan butler (reg varney),his conductor jack (bob grant) and their bumblingly autocratic inspector blake (stephen lewis) after their sackings from their regular jobs at the bus depot.they all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with stan's family (doris hare,anna karen,michael robbins) following therewith.british cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for high quality in the 1960's,but much of this was due to american financial support and guidance which sadly drew to a close as the 1970's dawned.thereafter,notable homegrown titles (get carter being the among these very few exceptions) became as rare as mick jagger in a stable marriage,and uk cinema went down the road of cheap budgets,sleazy and witless sex comedies (the confessions series,come play with me) and flabby,elongated celluloid versions of various tv shows,mostly sitcoms (this being one of many hideous examples).only dad's army and porridge came off fairly respectably in this regard;the quirky success of the first on the buses film (it was the biggest box-office hit of it's year in 1971,nonsensical to think now!) led to two further sequels.to be fair,the tv series itself had a cheerful,ripe,non-pc vulgarity about it which was reasonably tolerable in half-hour sitcom form,but stretched to three times that length it taxes the patience beyond belief.it's ironical that hammer films produced this effort as it virtually resembles a horror film in the literal sense,with ancient puns,hackneyed,poorly-timed slapstick and awful,seedy production values.a chance to send up the cheesiness of the british holiday camp is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements,and it is most bizarre,if not gruesome,to see the obviously 50-something varney and the beaky-nosed,long-toothed grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early twenties,while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes.the presence of wilfrid brambell (from steptoe and son) romancing the aged miss hare does not help matters either,and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours,it drags on to an interminably depressing degree.thankfully,this was the last film in this most dire of film trilogies,and the tv series itself came to an end around the same time,with a sequel (don't drink the water,which was roundly savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences) following in 1975.most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards,but the worst affected was bob grant.afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years,he committed suicide in 2003.a sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of it's era (it has not aged too well either),and should have remained that way,rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids which diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of it's tv counterpart.rating:2 and a half out of 10.

this was one of the shows that i wanted to follow-up on. but, i'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show. to have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like "the west wing" or "commander-in-chief." rob lowe was ok, but actors like kyle chandler just couldn't act (he was awful in "early edition"). it was a pain to sit through this show. with its lack of suspense, urgency, and characters who can actually act, i just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so i would have nothing more to miss.grade d-

i watched this movie with big expectations. the blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one. but it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying. the violence was nothing i haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in hollywood in the last 5 years - perhaps more), and at no stage was i even feeling uneasy let along frightened. again a cat 3 movie with big wraps, has not lived up to its hype.sure hire this movie, but don't go in with any expectations. i am so keen to get into the whole asian horror scene, but am continuously disappointed. i did love ichi, and audition, but then again, miike stands alone at the moment.please inspire me..... there is a large cluster of jaded genre fans who are starved of quality horror!

anthony wong stars in both this and the original (far superior) untold story, but the similarities stop there. wong doesn't reprise his role obviously, and instead plays a bumbling policeman who gets involved with a rather suspicious female, fung (1994's miss singapore, paulyn sun) who's a repressed nut-job, sure. but her tame jealous "wanna be with a guy who's with a girl" killer is no where near as compelling as what wong played in the first one. the movie itself seems tired and by the numbers. yeung fan as the physcho's love interest's unfaithful girl tries to keep one from total boredom by stripping down whenever possible, and sun does have a nice ass, but even that can't save this dud.my grade: d mei ah dvd extras: sub-titled interviews with cheung kam ching & paulyn sun; anthony wong filmography; a very brief synopsis; theatrical trailer for the film; & trailers for "chinese erotic ghost story" and "twenty something"

martin lawrence is not a funny man i runteldat. he just has too much on his mind and he is too mad which trips his puns pretty early in the game. he tries to make fun of critics, which boils down to "f*** them". then he goes on to rather primitive sexual jokes on smokers with throat cancer and it just goes downhill from there. 3/10

i saw this late at night on a minor channel and i put it on expecting a laugh or two. martin lawrence is a good comic actor and i reckoned he might be a good stand-up comedian/actor in the style of richard pryor.i couldn't have been more wrong. this concert was awful. it was full of racist comments directed at white people, muslims and people from india (muslims and indians are the same thing in lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clichéd cod-philosophy (lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform. do we really need a lecture on martin luther king and the civil rights struggle during a stand-up comedy show?). then there were his fawning comments designed to ingratiate him with women, it made my skin crawl listening to him.worst of all, the show simply wasn't funny and i found it boring. i turned over halfway through and flipped back to find him either still preaching or going on and on and on about the birth of his child (there was no humour in the story of the birth of his child and it was self-indulgent on his part to bore us with the details. he clearly didn't have very much to say or he would have cut this section of the show out).this show was rubbish: runteldat!

it's the single unfunniest thing i ever watched. it's sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny. he is the most bitter person i ever saw. his whole act he is trying to show how much he doesn't care, and by that only showing how much he's angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor who'd rather go through immense torture than go watch his "show". there are good comedians, there are bad ones and there are horrible ones. but this guy is in a league of his own. i feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny.

i usually really like lawrence and being in australia i haven't seen much of his stand up, so when i saw this at my video shop i thought, yeah i'll have a look. i wish i hadn't seen it now. obviously lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind, and i guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place.this whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. i believe the catch phrase of the night was "ride it until the wheels fall off" which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs.don't get me wrong, i don't mind crude humor, but lawrence lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of eddie murphy, richard prior or robin williams. lawrence was just plain lewd, the only time i laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. if there were minus points, i would give them....

...if only disney had stayed away from it. see, i think that this movie has some potential. well, the main character's situation does, at least. take out the whole jordan cahill thing, and you've got the beginnings of a decent movie! of course, you also lose more than half of the film, but, oh well. not that much of a loss.so, here it goes: you take a typical, preppy, suburban teenage girl (danielle panabaker, who's actually a decent actress) whose best friends screech a lot, mostly over a "pop sensation" (i'm assuming it's a direct quote from the movie; movie's like this almost always involve that particular phrase) named jordan cahill. except, of course, tpstg wants more out of life. enter brenda song's character, a sophisticated individual who is just what tpstg needs (honestly, i don't care what the character's real name is, i like the acronym better). the two new friends go to see jordan cahill (one to drool, one to make fun of the droolers), and they come out of it with his cell phone. hijinks ensue, and everything turns out alright in the end.if only disney, or any major film studio for that matter, didn't have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds. or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them. it's sugar-coated crap like this that make me more than a little unsure who to be more disgusted with (a little film called 'high school musical' comes to mind...)
