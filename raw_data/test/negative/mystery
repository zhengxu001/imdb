a funny thing happened to me while watching "mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er, excuse me, corpses) through his images. on the other hand, the english version at least is very badly dubbed. so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time! this film is stupid (funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town) and lurid (where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!)...miss it. (*)

this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen.i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but i cannot figure out where that came from. his co-workers find out and tease him terribly.during the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. they are all attractive, of course, else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist. he graduates eventually to actually killing, and that is what gets him caught.like i said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.

being a long-time fan of japanese film, i expected more than this. i can't really be bothered to write to much, as this movie is just so poor. the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever, pity i couldn't stand the awful acting, the mess they called pacing, and the standard "quirky" japanese story. if you've noticed how many japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too "different", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie. seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.fans of "beat" takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.2/10

"tokyo eyes" tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop. this lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk, and more talk. you'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and get a haircut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk, etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen. the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value, a meager cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama...just incessant yadayadayada'ing. (c-)

wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th century-fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. it is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. betty grable (an eleventh hour replacement for alice faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden don ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair). also good: charlotte greenwood as betty's pithy aunt, a limousine driver who's constantly asleep on the job, and carmen miranda playing herself (who else?). the stock shots of argentina far outclass the action filmed on the fox backlot, and some of the supporting performances are quite awful. by the time of the big horserace finale, most viewers will have had enough. *1/2 from ****

cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise. elizabeth shue actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in hollywood. i literally vomited while watching this film. of course i had the flu, but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode. why can't nick cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor. nick cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor. heck nobody could do it better.the search begins for nick's contract with lucifer or was it lou cipher from "night train to terror".

so tell me - what serious boozer drinks budweiser? how many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy's bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend's tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shue's assets.cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the 'tart-with-a-heart'.still - i did watch it to the end, by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shue's tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...

a big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. incredibly bad. very pretentious. it would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. we don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. we don't know why. nicholas cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but i feel that this role and this script let him down. and how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed? really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath.

this film is absolutely appalling and awful. it's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes ed wood's movies look like art. the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen. an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, woddy strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. there is sadism as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty. no talent was used to make this film. and the female love interest has a huge bhind- italian taste maybe. even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren't so many films available on video or viewers weren't really discerning. this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. it's actually and insult to the most stupid audience. i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this?

here's a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game, turkey shoot, gymkata and the running man.certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. upon discovery of the said corpse, the villains response? (bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all)  they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!)however, i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode (even if his screen time is very limited)not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b-movie enthusiasts.

at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'the final executioner'.. at least where i come from. a bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. great job on the dubbing too guys(!) best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck, he just gets out his gun and bang! why not do that earlier? it's a mystery. as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. i'm still puzzling over that one myself now.. 2/10

earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. well, parts of the earth, because somewhere in italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. the final executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, alan (william mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like kurt russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by edra (marina costa) and erasmus (harrison muller jr. ). alan has been trained to kill by former nypd cop sam (woody strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. as for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including ten little indians, the most dangerous game, and escape from new york. the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans.

many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying... men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone... a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today... soon u will know someone in the house has died... the dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji... one of the dead person's son is speaking with someone over the mobile, daughter is busy with her makeup... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over salwar kameez... another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office... then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person... the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... its anupam kher... suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed... is it his dream or a flash back? u won't get an answer until the end of the movie...well, this is wat comedy is for the director dibakar banerjee!!!!! later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream. is this a film comedy? well it is supposed to belong to that category... but it actually does not!!! there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie!!! more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police!!! so everyone must cheat the cheats!!!! or forget about justice!!!! music by bapi-tutul & dhruv dhalla is ok... nothing much to tell about other sectors... bad script destroys everything... not even anupam kher's performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool...

new york family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set, which nearly ruins david niven's marriage to mitzi gaynor. bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom(and nothing sexy happens there anyway). gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on, she turns off. film's sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky patty duke, pre-"miracle worker", as niven's daughter. she's delightful; "happy anniversary" is not. * from ****

the best thing about "the prey" is the tag line..."it's not human and it's got an axe"! the movie itself is a padded stinkaroo....endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die! no slasher fan will like this garbage.....watch "friday the 13th" again and burn any copy of this film you find! it also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever made!

this is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst slasher movies ever made. i know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by "friday the 13th". "the prey" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. the woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.but "the prey" is as bad as you might expect. i didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason. the situations rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. it just does not works for a slasher flick.the acting is simply horrid. the score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?! i won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me, it seems that it cost only 20 dollars.please avoid this one like the plague. it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen, and that's something to say. thank god it seems to have vanished from earth.

sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced.six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger. the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait.john carl buechler, my least favorite b-movie guy, did the lousymakeup effects here. the cast features carel struycken, of "thewitches of eastwick" and the addams family movies. sadly, hedoes not pop up until the very end of the film, and is covered inburn makeup, rendering him unrecognizable. steve bond (anyoneremember him?) is here in an early role as a victim.brown's direction, and the script he cowrote, both smell like thepresents brown bears leave in the woods. he pads the film withso much stock wilderness footage, i thought i accidentally rented aspecial episode of mutual of omaha's wild kingdom. much of thecast sits around the campfire and eats, then walk, and sit and eatagain. the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever putin a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to ababy deer. jackie coogan, who must have forgot he once workedwith the legends of silent cinema, has two scenes, and is involvedin the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he andthe hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber andcream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread...yeah.there is not one minute of suspense here. the killer, a forest firesurvivor looking for a mate, watches the students from behindtrees. we know it is the killer because the film makers havedubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wakethe viewer up every few minutes. skip this pile of pine sap and rent"halloween," instead.this is rated (r) for physical violence, mild gun violence, gore,some profanity, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexualreferences, and drug abuse.

i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. i recently found the prey in its original vhs 'big box' form and was very excited. i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic. usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. the prey is one of those films.to be fair, it started off ok, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods. the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch. this film is basically a big fat cliché, and when the "campfire stories" section rolls in, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back-story of the killer. i actually thought this was quite an original idea. however, the back-story ends abruptly and shows us some stock-footage of a burning woodland (the lack of budget really starts to show now). after this, we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods. the killer himself isn't shown until the end, which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer. sort of like cropsy from the burning, but better. as for gore, there isn't too much, although there's an ok face squishing moment at the end. overall, i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists - it really is a big mess.

hm. where do i start? i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance, but this time i wish i'd paid attention.i know some people liked it, and i'm not trying to say that they shouldn't. it was semi-amusing at some parts. but if you're like me and you don't like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random fast motion cloud scenes, dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to 'thrilling' music, and close-ups of faces while people are speaking, then you might want to avoid this movie. the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top, and the film quality was awful, fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all. and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on, but... well, she doesn't really convince me otherwise. in fact, i ended up really disliking her crazy character. and what was up with the souls in space? i understand this is a fantasy movie, but come on.i will say, the angel at the end was freaking creepy. it was the creepiest thing in the whole movie, way more creepy than the darth maul lava-face demon. i give them props for that scene, it was good. but not good enough to actually see the movie. and the opening credits were great, but don't be fooled! i would've rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better.bah. i wish i hadn't bought this for even the $2 that i paid for it, i could have bought a candy bar instead. :/

first of all, i really can't understand how some people "enjoyed" this movie. it's the worst thing i have ever seen. even the actors seem to be bored...and i think that says it all!however, i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators - that team seems to have a really good future. that's why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits, and one or two special effects sequences (if they're watched outside this movie, it almost looks like a good movie).better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this... this "thing!".

this movie really is that bad, and i'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. seeing this is like od'ing on pure suck. now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. you may have waded through every title from full moon and troma, all the movies of edward d. wood jr, uwe boll, albert pyun and direct to dvd-flicks from faded men-of-action. you may even have seen death tunnel, ghost lake and a vast array of the movies that mst3k covered, but in their original form. but you do not know truly awful film-making until you have seen darkhunters. and if you haven't, you shouldn't. don't bother. not only is this movie amazingly poorly written, directed, shot, edited, acted and splattered in crude, cheap aftereffects. first of all, it's a pretentious mess. but not good, greenaway or lynch-style pretentious or hilariously messy in an ittenbach or early waters sort of fashion. it's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart. sort of like m. night shaymalan (sp?), only that man seems like a freakin' messiah when compared to this trainwreck (and this coming from a rampant shaymalan hater). it's also boring. not heavy going-type boring, which is okay, if the movie awards your patience. darkhunters does no such thing. it's boring in a "oh my fu(king god, if i see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue i am going to fu(king kill myself!"-kind of way.btw. anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed.

i cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because i do not feel strong about it. i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it, that's all i can say...boring long sometimes even stupid...p.s. 7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazyi cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because i do not feel strong about it. i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it, that's all i can say...boring long sometimes even stupid...p.s. 7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazy

this is, arguably, the worst of the major ava gardner films. yes, she is gorgeous. but that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.in this turkey, robert walker has to pretend that he's eddie bracken (which surely embarrassed him). olga san juan plays the jane powell (golly, gee) part. dick haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (!), and eve arden plays helen broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). yes, the film contains a major popular song, "speak low." but check out the other, entirely forgettable, pieces. dick haymes sings very well, of course, and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava.the sets are cheap, the script is filled with clichés and failed humor, and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor (as indeed he was). in short, if you want to see ava in her prime, buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie.

i'll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. my first thought when seeing ava gardner and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time. boy was i wrong and disappointed.one touch of venus which starred mary martin, kenny baker, and john boles on broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and gardner, walker, and tom conway play the roles that martin, baker, and boles did on stage. the kurt weill-ogden nash musical with book by nash and s.j. perelman was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who reestablished herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood. look at the names that went into this show. given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some sparkling wit in this production. instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay, it was like all the wit was drained out of it. doing her best to make up for it is eve arden playing her usual girl friday role with tom conway, but it's even too much for eve.the story concerns department store window dresser robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of venus who springs to life in the person of ava gardner. of course when the statue goes missing, conway yells for the law and is suspicious of walker, the last person to be with the statue. the rest of the film is walker dealing with gardner and what will happen to both of them. for reasons i don't understand, ava was of course dubbed by eileen wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines. the singing is carried by dick haymes and olga san juan playing walker's friends and coworkers. of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker. you would kind of think that haymes would be playing walker's role at least. it was awkward to say the least.only three songs survived from the score, don't look now, but my heart is showing, that's him, and the incomparable speak low. haymes's silken baritone is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a duet by martin and baker on broadway. for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century, ogden nash, were done over by ann ronnell. i suspect the infamous code was at work here.in lee server's biography of ava gardner he makes mention of a brief fling ava had with robert walker when she had had a spat with her current man, howard duff. when duff and gardner reunited, walker took it badly and didn't speak at all to gardner off camera. i'm sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn't help matters either.hopefully some repertoire company will do one touch of venus and you'll get to see it the way, weill, nash, and perelman wrote it.

when naïve young eddie hatch, a window dresser at savory's department store, falls for a statue of venus and gives her a chaste kiss, venus steps off her pedestal and gives eddie more than he bargained for. this creaking example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. the purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on ava gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. robert walker as eddie gets lost in a thankless role. eddie's not just naive, but dithering and hapless. gardner is gorgeous, but the only things that give the movie any life are olga san juan as eddie's loving but jealous girl friend, tom conway as the suave owner of savory's and eve arden as savory's long time, wise cracking secretary. it's a role arden could play in her sleep, and she's good at it. the musical opened on broadway in 1943 and made mary martin a big-time star. the only point of a musical, however, is to have music. since one touch of venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts, kurt weill, composing, and ogden nash writing the lyrics, came up with a series of stylish, witty songs and one masterpiece. without the satire, or the clever songs or martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death. not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the weill/nash songs, they brought in the movie's music director, ann ronell, to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived, turning sharp observation into lovey-dovey romance. ronell was no hack; she wrote willow weep for me. wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked ogden nash's clever work. the one bright spot in the movie is that weill/nash masterpiece. "speak low" is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote. it's given one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments by eileen wilson dubbing gardner. dick haymes contributes a chorus. as for ann ronell, she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director, as well as composer and lyric writer. yours for a song: the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business, including ronell, kay swift, dorothy fields and dana suess. and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill/nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast, you might be able to track down the cd, one touch of venus (1943 original cast) / lute song (1946 original cast). the music is paired with lute song, another broadway show that starred martin.

i enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious. rh3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. i think i may have laughed once - and it was during the ngs. tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. i was able to predict everything - who the villain was, who the girl was, (spoiler alert) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc. i hope to see more movies from tucker and chan in their separate endeavors, but not in any more rush hour sequels. it's just too tired. i recommend a rental, but not a purchase.

for a series that was inspired by kolchak, it's ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans keller - i've often wondered if i'm missing the point. the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. this incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to whitby by teenage vampires who'll drink my blood while listening to busted, but that's a risk i'm willing to take. i've always been a werewolf man myself.

the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra bullock. her picture (from years after this film) basically is the cover art... and the back cover art... and the inside cover art... the same picture. her name is prominently shown on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disk itself. she is the first name in the list of stars. her biography is printed inside the case. this film must revolve around her character, right? wrong! it is her first movie and she plays a minor role. after watching the movie, every role seems like a minor role. the character dog actually displays some personality. less than an hour after watching it, i don't even remember the names of many characters.maybe if i watched it several more times, i could actually figure out the plot, but i don't think it would be worth the effort.oh, wait, i just remembered a funny bit! shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the "doom-cam". looks just like a first-person shooter game. hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.i am generally not a person to be critical of movies, but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen. i kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it.i'm just glad that the money we spent on this (used) went to charity.

this film stinks more than limburger cheese! if you find this at a garage sale, leave it there! i love sandra bullock and yet hate this movie... although ashamed, i do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra bullock is in this at all. they play it up to be "a sandra bullock movie". she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. well everyone has to start somewhere...

i broke my own rule buying this movie from the $5.88 bin at walmart. basically, if a movie has a big star in it, and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. well in the case of this movie, the reason is because it sucked! they plaster sandra bullock's photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait, and it reeled this little fishie right on in. i was thinking of donating the disc to charity, or giving it to the library, but i don't think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie. worst lines: "what do you mean army buddies?" "what do you mean your dad?"

far from combining the best bits of pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. whilst shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) pontypool was different and got progressively tenser, this just stinks. the radio dj, "we must stay on air" spends effectively no time on air. he sits on his bottom and watches the tv for news. this is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. is there a single person in the usa or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? or ever heard of the word "zombie"? well, by the 50th minute this bunch of misfits are still calling the zombies, "the infected ones" or the ones with "rabies'. the word "zombie" might make a guest appearance later, i could care less. maybe there's a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words? like the bluetooth earphone is called "the ear-thingy" i kid you not! to finish, no plot + no acting = no-one cares. a waste of time, a shameless, poorly executed rip-off.

stealing is a crime, and these guys, kenny yakkel and corbin bernsen look like their going to get away with it. i haven't even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if imdb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that i become filled with rage and feel as though i should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. o.k that's a little much but stealing is worse.ever seen pontypool? it was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008, this radio host goes into work, and then this zombie attack happens. we only see what's going on inside the radio station, and the only guess we have on what's happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky ken loney (easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind) and the bbc calling in for an update on the situation. from all the reviews i've read, and from the conversation i had with my friend (who has seen this film and pontypool) this film was exactly like it in the story, with minor tweaks here and there. so throw originality and creativity out the window. as for the zombies, or the infected, whatever you want to call them. they are the exact same thing, just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly, and have a never ending quench for flesh. they are zombies. zombies!!zombies!!! okay one to many, but back to this crappy movie. the zombies from what i've heard are a lot like the ones in 28 days later, another better movie, with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh. this is where zombie movies define themselves, story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as your not taking the idea of another film). sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story, as is the case with pontypool, but the zombies have to be, in a way, original. 28 days later started the insane raging zombie. pontypool i can't even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film. the evil dead, i think all i have to do is just type the name again because, come on it's the evil dead. romero is the master, and he went through all different types of zombies, from the painted face zombies in dawn of the dead to raging zombies in diary of the dead, and he did each one with his own unique style.so, after talking about other great zombie movies, i think it's about time i explain why i hate this movie without even seeing it. this movie down right steals the original story outline to pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing, yet in hollywood it's allowed, and apparently approved of. this is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie, and just tries to tell it differently. the 90's is like the worst period for movies ever, sure it had some gems but what decade doesn't, and it's because all the movies were the exact same. my favorite, the crime movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it till the very end. they force feed you one suspect, make it seem impossible that it's not anybody else but him, then, bam, all this time it was this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn't there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue, say "hey guys, what did i miss?" oh! didn't see that coming did ya! well, i'll leave a cliché as my closing statement. this is one film you'll surely want to miss.

corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports.its has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. there are some really good ideas here, but they just don't work. actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap. given the choice i'd watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again.

the idea behind dead silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. there was so much going for this film. unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.the film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. the zombies were soooo stupid! they ran around flailing their arms. they looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.i know this is a brief review, but i just don't see the need to invest much into this. it's a dumb movie. you've been warned.

i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick. the shonky production values and low-rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci-fi channel style knock offs.the central performance from bill moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act. the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever.the cinematography is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kind of films. it doesn't even manage a decent bit of convincing gore, the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film.the film tries to inject originality and a message into it's concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror. this is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a 6 year old. as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion - describing all people of a certain skin colour as "muslims." most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone. at the same time the "muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. presumably the far far superior pontypool had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably.

hard to believe - but it is! i shouldn't be surprised. commercials try to show how unique and "funny" a show can be. yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, i've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing, either.i don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness, cuteness or humor. the characters were insufferable for the most part. especially selma blair's (which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this). the few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite.rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all. and this is not one of them. kath and kim has exactly one redeeming quality - and that's selma blair. despite wearing repugnant outfits and acting like a pitiful, whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between britney spears, paris hilton and kim kardashian, selma is still nice to look at.but if you want to look at selma, go rent hellboy. you'll at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of searing this abominable character into your brain to associate with her.all in all, kath and kim is a waste and truly epitomizes the worst that tv is or ever has been. it sets a new low.

this is your typical junk comedy.there are almost no laughs. no genuine moments. no memorable lines. no scenes where you think to yourself, "that was clever". nothing. the plot is embarrassingly bad. it's ugly to look at and boring as hell! there is no substance here. this movie has nothing. it doesn't matter if farely was in this or not. a crap movie is a crap movie no matter who's involved. also, david spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in ever movie/tv show that he's in.this movie was dead on arrival. there is no life here. no fun. no intelligence. there are plenty of other "dumb" comedies more enjoyable that this one. this film is just pathetic. 2/10

*** possable spoiler but probably not ***the game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in itanymore! diddy is gone aswell!the 1st donkey kong country was one of my two all time favoritesuper nintendo games. (the other being super mario world)the 2nd donkey kong at least had diddy kong and good levels,although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times.however this one is the worst of the lot! it does not have the feel ofthe original or 2nd, the enemy's look stupid and the levels areeven worse. it does not look realistic anymore! i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two, the first had greatbackground music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in thisgame is horrible!it happens a lot these days that movies, shows and sometimesvideo games that start out fantastic, end up with it being ruined bya stupid sequel! i am sad to say i feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as goodnow that it has donkey kong 3!they should have left it at the original or maybe the 2nd one.

sorry to disagree with you, but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging. so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games. this is, mind you, almost ten years after the initial release of dkc 1. the graphics were ground-breaking for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. the music and characters are all memorable, and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. true, the second game was better than the first, and the third was perhaps lacking the 'edge' of the second installment. but all three offered different play, and i enjoy them to this day. by the way, i'm old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever (and tvs were black and white!).

(warning: some spoilers ahead.)what an incredibly crappy movie. it makes iron eagle 2 seem good.the story is as follows: captain holiday (rutger hauer) gets shot down by his friend banning (robert patrick) to stop him from shooting down a iraqi airliner filled with innocent civilians. six years later holiday returns to take his revenge. among other things he, sitting in a tank, chases banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife over a field. he manages to fire shells and drive the tank at the same time. after getting the tank blown up by a bazooka, he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet. with it he shoots down a number of allied fighters before attacking the nato headquarters in an attempt to kill banning's wife.an extra bonus is that major baxter (who holiday hangs in her office) has put the rank insignia on her right shoulder on backwards. elegant.

well, you know... rutger hauer and robert patrick both are really good actors. but wtf with this movie? the story was lame and the script was just terrible. the poor actors didn't have material to work with!the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick. you would expect something like top gun... huge disappointment! the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke. the aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources, not made for this movie. and they didn't even care about the marks or the fighters models, taking for granted the audience will not notice it.as i said the story was lame. with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting. in short, it seems a b-movie made in the 70's.i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here. they sure must be ashamed.

well, this movie shows us that mark griffiths and producers think we all are idiots. if not how should we understand this:american pilots take off on mig-29s. suddenly all aircrafts turn to f-16s. ha, a magic! after an action... migs land. the magic again!oh, did i mention that f-16s had israel markings? another magic: obviously unarmed l-39 trainers are bombing enemies.and more magic: while all movie is situated in europe, we can see a desert in almost any flying scene.maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above, because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs.ok, ok, this is a movie. i should write about its story... wait. a story? yes there is some story in this film. and its horrible as well.

my caddy limo was destroyed!!! well, i had one just like it - drove the hoi polloi and many of the chosen ones around manhattan for a few years. that was a whole lot more entertaining than this movie i can tell you. lordy, what a bomb - as in rpg go boom. i also drove a lot more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this dud of a flick. robert patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. unfortunately, rutger hauer played his part like a red-nosed circus clown. if he couldn't take it serious why should his audience? the director should have kicked his butt off the set in the first hour of filming.the dialog was written by 10 yr old's for 8 yrs old's. surprised there wasn't a whole lot more cracking up on the sets. oh well, i am a movie fanatic - ergo - you must take the bad to get to the good.

this movie is astonishingly poor. it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho dialogue, waiting for leslie nielsen to appear. it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn't actually a comedy, it was meant to be taken seriously. what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie, and worse still - other people funded it and gave it the green light.rutger hauer obviously doesn't read movie scripts before he signs up, either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay.strangely, this film is so poor, that you find yourself staring at it, wondering how it actually got funded, and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it. the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful, with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas intruments "speak & spell".the hollywood money machine at it's worst. funny though.

it's as if the stay-puffed marshmallow man from ghostbusters had been reincarnated in rutger hauer's body and is taking revenge upon a rival's pregnant wife! if seeing an obese hauer chase a very pregnant isabel glaser (imagine the spine-tingling thrills in that contest) sounds good to you, see this film! seriously, if hauer is what an iraqi pow looks like after six years in prison, then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line to a jail in baghdad. overall "tactical assault" rates 2 stars instead of 1 because mike mitchell as hawk is terrific. mitchell burns up the screen as a nato pilot until his plane is burned up itself (by an enemy missle), whereupon the film loses what little verve it had to begin with.

... said the continuity announcer as tactical assault was about to be broadcast . after seeing the first two minutes i started thinking rutger might want to get a new agent . after seeing the next ten minutes i started thinking rutger might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances yup this is a truly terrible movie . i wasn't expecting much and why should i if the name rutget hauer appeared in the credits , but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured nato warplanes with ussr markings bombing bosnia i realised i was going to be force fed inedible turkey three months after christmas .the attention to detail is non existent . nato planes carry ussr markings then were told hauer's character spent six years in an iraqi prison which would make the setting 1997 . what nato were bombing the serbs in 1997 ! i guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy but i know i did . the producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with iraqi jets that suddenly turned from migs to f-4 phantoms then back again but i did . even stranger characters would take off in f-16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a soviet built mig oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot centres around a basic instinct revenge plot . i'll give the producers some credit ( maybe credit is too strong a word ) because after seeing plots featuring nannies from hell , policemen from hell , flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps tatical assualt being the worst movie of the lot

there is nothing original,humane or insightful in this film. the acting is average, images are amateurish, the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic...something close to a soap.in 2:37,a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama. we watch, partly, because we want to know who dies. the various characters each have a problem, and the film shows how bad each problem is for them, but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves. despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events, there is never another way of seeing the events themselves. so in 2:37, the arseholes are arseholes, the angels are angels. this is simple stuff.without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence. you hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts, bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation.in the end, if you know anything about film in the last 5 years, 2:37 is just an immature rip off of elephant - not a meditation, not a progression. yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy, they never talk about gus van sant or elephant. the positive posts on imdb curiously avoid any mention of this, or simply don't value originality. if you do want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youth exploitation. i was surprised by the filmmakers age when i found out after seeing this film - i had assumed a 13 year old had made it. the twenty somethings i've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man.

by the time the hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin. dr. paul merchant (bruce ramsey) is a scientist in the future, whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors (all played by ramsey) had first built the evil lament configuration puzzle-box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box. the film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one. yes, this could be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the film, or what have you. but i'm reviewing the film as is, and not what it was or could have been. and as it is now it's a mess. sure the franchise will go on indefinitely with direct to dvd sequels, but this one was pretty much a death-nail to it's chances of getting a new one released theatrically ever again.my grade: d-

after the failure of "hellraiser iii: hell on earth," the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. an abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs under 90 minutes... on display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched b-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while still attempting to keep the whole project completely serious. i'm wondering, how many freaking directors did this thing have? poor pinhead has so much screen time, that every bit of mystery and menace that this iconic character possessed, is completely lost. after an hour of hearing long-winded speeches and dramatic posturing, we simply want to tell the guy to shut up! mildly entertaining in spots, especially in the first segment, this mess begins to look and feel like a cheap, ugly made for tv splatter flick after a while, and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable: pinhead, along with his pet cenobite dog, killing a bunch of idiots... in outer space! i'm sorry, but any true fan of the first two films in the series, that gave this abortion of a film more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. on a side note, the film that follows; "hellraiser: inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent, and stylishly-made film-noir piece, that brilliantly reinstates 'pinhead' as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of the inherent evil in human kind, that was the centerpiece of the original film, and the whole point of the story. for any serious horror fan, see hellraiser i & ii, skip the lousy iii & this one, and continue with 'inferno.' you won't miss a thing by skipping this garbage...

the joe cool review - hellraiser: bloodlinestarring: bruce ramsay as phillip l'merchant/john merchant/dr. paul merchant, valentina vargas as angelique and doug bradley as pinheadplot: this follows a timeline of the lineage of the merchant bloodline, which started with phillip l'merchant, who created the box that opens the doorway to hell. starting with the 18th century to present time when pinhead first meets merchant and tries to sever the bloodline..(he's the only one who can stop pinhead, you see) and finally in the future, in space, where paul merchant has finally figured out how to send pinhead to hell for good.openers: this is a movie hated so much by the people who made it, they declared fictional director alan smithee would be the credited director. they only pull smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie, such as classics as the birds ii: land's end or bloodsucking pharaohs in pittsburgh. no i didn't make that up. how did i like it? you're reading this so i'm sure that's what you want to know.the good: this movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe. oh i'm not going to sugar-coat it. this movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster, but it does have some positives. cooler cenobites this time around for starters, such as the twins and the demon angelique. pinhead is still in a main role, and still has good lines("pain has a face, allow me to show it to you") and it's somewhat entertaining throughout. gorehounds will love the movie because of it's endless supply. there is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you'll have to look hard to see it. the chatterer dog is awesome.the bad: but for a story about hell vs the cursed merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included. pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom! random deaths just to feature more blood(not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of the story). pinhead is at his worst here, he rants and rants and rants even when he's about to die! for the very smart demon that he used to be, he's been reduced to nothing more than a bond villain, at best. if hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role, this is it. bloodline ruined it for us all.the ugly: gore is always mentioned here. this one has skin ripping, drilling, hook impaling, beheadings, and more goodies. the chatterer dog, while awesome, reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes.final verdict: this movie had the potential for something great, even hellbound levels of greatness. but all of that was wasted. who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap, but we can only blame alan smithee.compared to the rest: this movie is the worst of the hellraiser series. for completists only.rating: 1/2* of *****

this film is so copy-cat, cliché-ridden, clumsy, and laboured, i find it astounding that anyone could not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. here is the range of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologising, and simply unfeasible storytelling in this "hard hitting" representation of high school: the tough guy jock is really a homosexual. the a-student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this causes him to commit incest. a teacher is mean to a student who wets his pants in class. a girl who is going out with the above-mentioned jock is really in love with him and "just wants a family".maybe the only saving grace is the student counsellor scenes which are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this film are so leaden that it beggars belief. this film shows me no insight into teenagers and i will not be surprised when it bombs, especially with teenagers. the people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers, and boy are they barking up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with "understanding" teen issues. i mean, what is the moral of this film? "hey guys, let's all look out for each other and hug each other" give me a break. anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14 year old with that kind of message needs to think back. in the 1980s we were watching kentucky fried movie, xtro, porky's, evil dead, terminator, etc. this film will fall on deaf ears. 2:37 is right up there with another australian "indepedent" film, 'one perfect day,' which was as bad as this utter turkey of a film. thank god no taxpayers money was spent on this boloney.avoid!!!!

rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains (more or less) acceptablebloodline is a rather short (which is a good thing in this case) escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box. who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it. we're introduced to 3 generations of the merchant family (all played by bruce ramsey); one in 18th century paris, one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far, far away opinions on this storyline may differ a loteither you think it's very idiotic and far-fetched ororiginal and dared. the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling. hellraiser: bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead (doug bradley) still is an extra horror-value. pinhead  accompanied by a pet puppy this time  still knows how to killtoo bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites' and the occult parisian portrait. giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barker's initial masterpiece. although not highly memorable itself, bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film. after this sequel, the series went downhill completely. so far, 2 more sequels came out (2 more are still in process) and neither of those is worth seeing. hellraiser:bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan smitheemeaning he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it. who could blame him?

never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. the main character alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) but instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an ever present, biting artistic director/villain. and the cliche's! not only does she become anorexic, bulemic, an over the counter junkie, and a pathological liar, but all in the course of a few months. it's like the writer read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could cram into two hours, (with commercials).believe it or not, but i am a dancer. this "uprising" or "resurgence" of anorexia and bulemia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools i have attended. in fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight. i'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie.another annoying problem this movie had was the means-to-an-end writing style. her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. the other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psycological problem. as it is, it turns into a one woman show, and kimberly mccullough doesn't have the chutzpah to pull it off.to a non dancer, this movie would be a supposed "insight" into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company. to a dancer, this is a very insulting movie, which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and ill informed. those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place. 3/10

i just purchased this movie because i love to donate to operation smile, the charity on which the movie was based...but i found the writing of the movie to be very strange. it t does not really focus so much on operation smile or similar organizations like the smile train and their herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. no, it concentrates on an american teenage volunteer, katie, whose "over-privileged" life in malibu, california, includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she'll have birth control pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend. what is this birth control nonsense supposed to do, titillate the audience? it's 2005. i'd be more surprised if in 2005 a malibu teen wasn't on birth control, and even if she is, so what and who cares? contrasting katie is the character of lin in china, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one. neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with, let alone understand the motivations of, either girl. on the other hand, the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script. the best performance was by the gentleman playing lin's father although much of his dialogue is in chinese and subtitled. operation smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this!

not to be confused with michael ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this "smile" is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell.the film parallels two stories: an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named ling (yi ding), and a tv-spawned malibu family act out "gidget get birth control." katie (mika booram, the third olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality. her teacher (sean astin) paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children.the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster. kramer continually masks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material. she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal. why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip. it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie.funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans. they envisioned a heritage of quality family films. give me "son of paleface" any day.

this movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. and the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... the plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character i have seen for a long time. the acting and scenery were ok, but the plot ruins everything, full of cheap clichés and hypocritical scenes, i expect not to see this movie again in my life. skip this one!

i truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it.sure, i'm all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture.1987's "river's edge" is an excellent example of a well-made teen drama. however, what i take exception to is the infantile, grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of "2:37" took.a prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them.my other major problem with this film, apart from its complete plagiarism of gus van sant's "elephant" (surprised van sant didn't sue) is its 'bull loose in a china shop' attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide.in short, avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently. i've heard that his motivation for making "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. having seen the substandard result, this doesn't surprise me in the slightest. this is a glorified student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on dvd. pure and simple.

the time i wasted seeing this movie, i demand back! i felt sick afterward, but not because it touched me in any way. it's pretentious, trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved, but i couldn't care less. the characters are soulless and stupid. you don't get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesn't leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation. all of the students in the movie has issues, but since you don't feel for them you don't believe their problems.if i could write better in english i'd never stop. but i can't, so, i'll stop now.don't watch this.

this movie made me think....of how i could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors, who, as an australian, i am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film.but the movie itself? let me tell you a story....found this dvd in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here, so i thought i would give it a go.for some reason, i decided to watch the 'special features' before i watched the actual movie, not something that i usually do. turned the 'making of' off halfway through, as i'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script' attitude.the movie? ugh. full of clichés and pathetic character development. the actors? well done guys, you are aussies and i applaud you. and, just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them, you unfortunately did not have a great script to work with.i felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. i have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. agreed.finally (and forgive me if i don't phrase this correctly), i was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. yes, we all know that life is full of hard stuff, and yes we know that things such as incest do occur, but i really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it. i believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there somewhere. otherwise, the movie is all about them and their feelings, they have created it for themselves, not for an audience.which i think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great. the special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting, the day after he himself tried to end his own life. well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, however the movie reeks of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. "i feel horrid, i'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid". (note: i have read the interview with andrew urban, and understand why thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues, but i believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed - the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs, and i feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here)by his own admission, the director had no technical experience at all, and sadly, this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.as for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should watch it - not sure there either. because there is a very dangerous line at the end. i too have been in a place where i have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky', but as an adult, i do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind. might be in there to promote discussion, but again, it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. in fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.i haven't seen elephant, but i just might go find it, given all the comparisons here.nothing personal here guys, i do hope you can make another movie someday, and we all have to start out somewhere, so forgive me if i've been too harsh. i am glad that you are proud of what you created, which in the end is what life is all about. it's not a movie i would recommend though.oh, i did like the way the time-frames often collided, thought that was an interesting way to film. but the whole "its the quiet ones you have to watch" - we already know that.

i'm sure some people will enjoy it, and find it powerful, or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story, but from an unbiased stand point, it's not very well done. the film revolves around atypical angst-ridden teenagers, each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what it's like to be a teenager. we get to see a bit of each teenager's lifestyle, but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me, whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree branches in the wind, or the black and white "interviews" with the students, there was nothing new or original showcased in this movie, and nothing i needed to see. yes, it deals with some strong subject material, and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well, but the entire project seems unnecessary, especially when it seems almost an exact replica to van sant's "elephant" (one dealing with suicide, the other with a school shooting). as i said, some people will probably enjoy this, and the director/writer clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one, so it's nice the movie was made with some heart in it, but i feel it's incredibly ineffective, and when dealing with material that can be so easily clichéd to do something original with it. i would not recommend this movie.

it is fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking (quoting some of the comments). murali k. thalluri must have thought by himself: "oh, great! elephant ... what a fantastic movie! i'll try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices!", sadly enough, he even failed with his outrageous idea. the movie turns out a complete failure. considering that it tries hard to catch the brilliance of gus van sants "elephant", it makes it look even more ridiculous - a most embarrassing faux pas for a film director.the movie starts off with the suicide of a student in the schools bathroom. this scene, already, shows the awkward acting skills of each one involved in this scene. you don't buy a single word they say. in carries on, interrupted by short interview-styled bits of the kids who "live on their marry lives" with each bit rather distressing in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue. thalluri means to introduce the characters this way, to give a kind of fast-as-junk-food insight look into their hearts ... and fails once again. not five minutes later, thalluri ultimately screams at the audience "yes, people! i stole this movie and for some curious reason, i am proud of it!" by taking gus van sants most unmistakable narrative style from "elephant": he shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation. hm, doesn't this seem awfully familiar? to me, this certain level of very forgiving tolerance had been infringed right there to a point at which i couldn't stand this dreadful movie any more. shame on you, murali k. thalluri, i say! i am especially surprised that "2:37" has reached the official selections in cannes as of 2006, whereas everyone must have certainly remembered "elephant" (2003) at the very same film festival just a few years ago! so, how in the name of the lord did this most disgraceful rip-off end up being shown there? i find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistake.directors like thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who aren't (and cannot completely be) aware of every independent film out there. as elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema (although it is without a doubt a masterpiece), few people notice that the story as told in "2:37" had been told before! how that is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to cannes, i cannot say. it is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it.2:37 is by all means solely commercial, worthless as an independent film and (on a certain level) rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol, "elephant".

i don't understand what is hard hitting about this movie! i don't understand why high school kids should watch this! i don't understand why this should have made me think about anything in the slightest!*spoiler*when the un-noticed girl is on her way to commit suicide, was i the only person cheering her on? the cliché'd classical music, long tracking shots, melancholy emotion of the film by that stage had me in reversal to what was intended. i would have only been happy if she walked into the room and the entire cast was in there with her holding scissors to slit their wrists up. why?cause i went to high school.... and frankly im sick to death of seeing movie after movie in australia with teenagers in it being solely based on terrible clichés. i've been waiting ages for a younger person to write a movie that im able to relate to and this stereotype driven piece of emo garbage is what i got instead. it was like a dark version of heartbreak high that needed a predictable ending. why are all teenagers in aussie dramas depressed or have really weird problems that just aren't plausibly told? on the plus side, this was funnier then 'blurred'. and i needed a good laugh.

honestly, mr. thalluri.... if you do a drama movie in a high-school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you mess up the time-frame and jump back and forth... if you do that, you can't use the exact same visual story telling device of "elephant" which is using a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles. you just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating.where "elephant" (which was released 3 years prior to this movie) uses school shootings (or to be exact the columbine shooting) as the focal point for its script 2:37 uses teen suicide and seeing the reviews the shock value of that subject worked. its the same slow story telling, a lot of dramatic piano music all leading to a finale you know from the beginning. at least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. so you got a untypical gay guy who looks acts like a stoner/skater, a hunky lover-boy who can't deal with his gay side, brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here comes the nose dive. you also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever... a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of "2 urethra syndrome" who actually never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does so every day! wow, as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing i have ever heard. he gets beaten up on the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. thats new-age realism directly leading to "the twist" and final character who turns out to be the suicide victim...after watching the "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day including, incest-rape, teen pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before, kind of like your "very realistic" daily soap... trying hard to be) we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him (in a thoughtful piano playing sequence btw, seen that somewhere before??). and it gets even better... before slitting her wrist in a painful long scene of "yes" and "no" she asks 2-urethra-guy if he is ok, constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors in a school toilet. now you got a movie that is a total rip-off of elephant, fails with some really sloppy story telling (the whole rape-incest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way) and people call this a shocker.what the heck is going on?? is all it takes to take some pseudo-dramatic music, boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here?? i think elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious rip-off failing on many more levels. i have never ever seen a more brazen stealing of a whole movie concept in my life... and believe me i watched a hundred of horror movies so i know how low you can go there. this is a total let down in all departments... its nor realistic, its stolen, its damn slow and by all means i wonder whats more useless... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch romeo+juliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear non-romantic and more realistic way) or this ridiculous set up... come on! i am still trying to work out if 2-urethra-guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.

i couldn't relate to this film. i'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so 'realistic'. how many people at your school were victim to incest? how many closet homosexual jocks were there? how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? hmmm. ok you wouldn't know even if their were. but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with. and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored. but hey, where's the 'entertainment' in that?with regards to the girl who committed suicide - i found this to be exploitative. i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed? the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative. and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative. i didn't buy it as a real life scenario.and the problems of the other students i didn't fully relate to. bullying is explored but that's been done to death, we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person. closet homosexuality? pfft, another cliché gets rolled out. thats the thing really, too many clichés. i guessed the ending at the start. there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. you've got all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. and i thought, what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim? and surely enough..one thing i will say, and it is the saving grace of the film, is that it does not glamourise suicide. the suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch. it is a powerful scene (regardless of how contrived it is)and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option. but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at cannes???

i caught 2:37 at the afi fest in los angeles. it's a very well shot first film (though the dv format begins to show itself in outside scenes), and i'm sure it has good intentions of showing us the "dark side" of high school - in other words every side of high school. but the filmmaker doesn't have the talent to write or direct up to the premise's promise. there are several characters, but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be. there's no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of "i am troubled teen x, i have y problem." the perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome.let's start with the men. you have the stoner kid who's gay, the jock who's also gay, the boy who rapes his sister, and mr. peepants. as the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves. naturally (or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes), the two gay male characters beat up women, peepants, and themselves. i'd be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads, or if the characters somehow transcended them. yet neither took place, and that's all there is to these characters' stories.next, the ladies. one young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant rapee of the sister-raping brother, and there's the girl who kills herself (i'll get to that later). again, i don't think there's a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers (i'd be out of a job were that the case), but i do think that it's only justified if there's more to that character or story. if that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than "i'm a teenager and life sucks," i'd be happy as a clam. but nothing new is revealed! nothing is subverted, or changed, or sublimated.finally, the girl who kills herself. this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling. we're supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we've seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film? we've followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story? it's cheap, exploitative, and sloppy. despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this, you have to earn something like that. you can't simply purchase it on credit. so this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down, and the film ends. what have i learned? i already knew high school sucked - been there, done that. i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. i already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked.what else is there, then? smoke, mirrors, and some really nice views of leaves. oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina i've seen in a while.

this film did well at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce, the gazebo. frankly, i am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ludicrously plotted unfunny comedy. both lead characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. a veteran supporting cast including fred clark, harry morgan, and eva gabor lend excellent support. and, the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of spain seem lush. and, there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter.i cannot recommend it started with a kiss.

i have read each and every one of baroness orczy's scarlet pimpernel books. counting this one, i have seen 3 pimpernel movies. the one with jane seymour and anthony andrews i preferred greatly to this. it goes out of its way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. i don't expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script. sticking with the 80's version....rahne

the screen writers for this mini-series should have been sentenced to the guillotine themselves. they butchered a very fun story and squandered the talents of richard e. grant. the only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. all of the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same. i strongly suggest watching another version of the scarlet pimpernel. any other version is better than this one.

i have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. i absolutely adored everything that i have been acquainted previously. but lately i've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. i still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which i am not in a hurry to read. so an idea dawned on me - sink me! there are movies which i have not watched! thus, i must watch them immediately.the first five minutes of these series were... acceptable. in fact, i quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed. it went all downhill from there, though. chauvelin was too... foppish? and, i daresay, too old for this role. not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either-or. (and what was that with random bed scene featuring him? it was way too creepy - wasn't his only love the madame guillotine, and his only interest - his job, and his only obsession - sir percy?) marguerite... prettiest woman in france? cleverest woman in europe? i think not. although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of sir percy i haven't the faintest idea. and whatever my lord tony has done to deserve this death? yes, every member of the league did pledge his life to sir percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. and if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened. which brings me to another point, sir percy. his portrayal was most dreadful. he was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. nor did he care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) and with his own hands he had never killed anyone. so what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people?the costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well. this is post-revolutionary france we are talking about! not pre-revolutionary. people in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily. it was all just... gah!although, i must admit, after i watched other parts my opinion did change slightly. watching it as a separate work, independent of scarlet pimpernel series, it was tolerable. just your other average hero in the mask. but for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable.

i don't know why they even kept the name. how they could call the series 'the scarlet pimpernel' after they deviated from the novels so much, i wouldn't have a clue. the character names are the only things they kept, and even then they changed a few of those, and mixed them up, and changed percy's relationships with them. admittedly, i only watched about two hours at the most of it, but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like baroness orzcy had portrayed her characters, and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing. poor lady. i hope that when the next person wants to make a movie/series of the book they don't ruin it as completely as this series did.

before i start to tear apart this movie, mark you--i love the scarlet pimpernel. that story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. the movie staring jane grey is very good and the musical on broadway is the hottest thing there. so, i thought when i heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a bbc film.to my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that utterly failed in capturing the gorgeous tale.there were no exciting escapes with daring disguises. there was no deep love that made your heart flutter as percy left the room and marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her again.all it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out-of-the-blue sex and violence.sink me! what a horrible movie!

having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrews/janeseymour version, i have to say that this is not good at all.according to the books, percy is supposed to be a seeminglyfoppish aristocrat when he's being percy, and witty and cleverwhen he's being the pimpernel, but here he just looks bored aspercy and mean as the pimpernel. marguerite is supposed to bethe most beautiful woman in europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due tobad make-up). richard e. grant has done much better things, andelizabeth mcgovern's acting is uninspired and flat. the wit anddash of the books and the andrews/seymour film is here replacedby brawn and flashy editing that just don't make the cut.  i might add that to a person who hasn't seen any previous versionor read the book, it would probably look ok.

dire! dismal! awful! laughable! disappointing!right, your trapped in "the cave" with several "hard" men and a woman or two, your being systematically killed by "something" and you still don't get to hear any naughty grown up words!!! a 15 cert' here in england, and you could tell!the egos of the "macho men" was just too much, pass the bucket i'm going to be sick.this movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever. i have a feeling that this description isn't the first time to pop its his head from a hole in the ground.just like the film the cube, it looked like a good concept but was just let down at the last post by, well its self.this comment contains spoilers alright, its called the cave.thanks bruce.

the mission to see the movie "the cave" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. it's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.the immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. what's he going to look like? why does he live in a cave? how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like alien and predator and the relic? the cave "demons" do not look far from the skeletal creature in alien: resurrection and even has the sight of predator. shame that's a total ripoff...well, let's look at the plot: very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the carpathian mountains. the casting was very much clear that we want young, hip, tough chicks, chiseled guys, and the girls who have brains also have to be hot. we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film-makers are biased to a certain viewpoint. totally been done, and i'm totally tired of it.the other main problem was the ending, as if to say there might be a sequel. plase shoot me if there is one. the tagged on ending made me wretch.i gave this movie 3/10 stars. the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature-builders for their high-quality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within, even when they looked totally ripped off. and there's an interesting (yet labored) documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving. go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.

and totally non-scary film. the characters doesn't interest at all, and most of the time is spent in a car. the dog is at best ugly, never really scary. to interest, a more threatening menace would have been needed, at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you. and, not the least, something interesting must happen. something unexpected. as it is, this film just drags on and on, in what seems like forever. maybe a saint bernhard was not that smart to choose as the terrible threat to life and society?in most scary movies/thrillers/mystery, just whatever genre, there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens. here you really don't care, you just wait for it all to stop, and wondering if it wouldn't be better to see something else. one of the weakest king adaptations.

cujo is a giant, lovable, gentle and affectionate st. bernard owned by the camber family, during the opening sequence cujo chases a rabbit over fields and through a local wood somewhere in castle rock, maine. the rabbit disappears into a burrow and cujo sticks his head into the entrance hole. the rabbit vanishes from cujo's sight, angry cujo starts to bark and in doing so inadvertently wakes up and annoy a colony of bats, one of which bites him on the nose. donna trenton (dee wallace-stone as dee wallace) is having an affair with steve kemp (christopher stone, dee wallace's real life husband) which her husband vic (daniel hugh kelly) who works in advertising, discovers. obviously their relationship becomes strained. happily oblivious to all of this is their young son tad (danny pintauro). joe camber (ed lauter) fixes cars for a living out of his barn on his farmhouse. joe is planning a guys weekend with one of his friends gary pervier (mills watson) when his wife charity (kaiulani lee) wins $5,000 on the lottery and decides to take their young boy brett (billy jayne as billy jacoby) with her on a trip to see her parents. arriving at gary's house to pick him up joe finds him dead on the floor, he goes into the kitchen to call for help and his dog cujo who is now rabid attacks and kills him. donna and tad drive to the camber's farmhouse to try and get her car repaired. the place is deserted except for cujo who is now completely rabid, foaming at the mouth, his fur stained red with blood and maddened by pain. cujo attacks the car to try and get at donna and tad, luckily for them the windows hold firm, at least for the time being anyway. donna tries to start the car but it has completely broken down, they are both trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come and rescue them. cujo lies in wait, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path. directed by lewis teague i thought the film was a bit slow for my tastes. the first half plods along, the second half builds up a head of steam but i still felt it was a little underwhelming and unexciting. the acting is fine by everyone involved, i've no complaints there. technically the film is ok, photography, music, special effects, editing and it's generally well made. the big problem is the script by don carlos dunaway and lauren currier and in particular it's first half, most of which appears to be padding to stretch the run time out. clocking in at just under the 90 minute mark it felt longer. it's also a little predictable as well. cujo as a monster never really scared me either, i just don't find slobbering overweight st. bernards scary i guess. i suppose there's nothing really wrong with it, but i don't think i'd be in a hurry to see it again. average, not too bad if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on t.v. for free.

not me.. if it came down to it, i could kick a dog's ass, and that's why this movie doesn't work for me. if it was me against the alien, or jason.. or.. hell, i dunno.. any other horror movie antagonist, then there'd be no contest and i'd have my ass handed to me barring divine intervention. a horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, person, being, entity, whatever, that is more powerful or resourceful or intelligent than they are, and then people think 'well what if that happened to me', and they get scared - and that's why this is a horrible idea for a story. i can't imagine myself being terrorized by a dog, so i'm not scared.

man, i just cant believe this movie. i have watched it entirely (believe me, i have done this !) and the best part was the traillers on the beginning (and i hate traillers!!!!).no plot, no acting, no nothing. i was watching the movie and thinking, "when this is going to start" ? it never started. how people can spend money and time to make such a crap ?the "plot": a dog gets bitten by a bat and get rabies - okay, until now no problem, nothing special but ok. now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will chase people!!! thats it, nothing else!!! now add to this some of the worse actings/actors i have ever seem, some completely irrealistic scenes (and some others really idiotic, like the child cant breath and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better), and a very lame ending, thats it, here you have crap... ops!.... cujo.do your self a favor and make something more worthy, like hiting your head against the wall or play chess with yourself.zero out of 10.gabriel.

don't get me wrong, i love stephen king! and this is a pretty good movie over all. the rabid cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. but after the first few minutes that poor donna and her little son tad were held captive in their pinto by the rabid st. bernard, i began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.she could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (i mean, it was a pinto for pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. when she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? no, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. she did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a waste of time! i mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. but, forget the bat. were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? i didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?at the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by god she was still wearing high heels!

1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen. christine, the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other. while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch, christine and cujo were both pretty bad, and it's a close-run thing as to which is the lesser of the two. if pushed for an answer i'd say cujo - marginally - is the weakest.donna trenton (dee wallace, fresh from success as elliot's mom in "e.t - the extra terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to husband vic (daniel hugh-kelly) is hanging by a thread. she's been having an affair with a local worker, and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband. dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton (danny pintauro), son of donna and vic, and a pretty messed-up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks. donna and tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics' yard for repairs, but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt. things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic, joe camber (ed lauter), isn't there (he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo, a gigantic st. bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) soon, the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims. the weather is swelteringly hot; not a living soul knows they're there; the car won't start; and the dog seriously wants their blood......cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller, but it never really clicks into gear. i've read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for king - so it's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little. on the printed page, king was at least able to generate a degree of tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st. bernard simply isn't very scary. the "visualness" of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st. bernard. in the book, it was possible to forget this. in the book, cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster. even with the relatively short running-time of an hour-and-a-half, cujo becomes a tedious and patience-straining experience, occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be. they've even omitted the book's cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an "all's well that ends well" conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood!!! chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation.

i hated it. i hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art. this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid. after the first half hour, i fastfowarded through the dvd version, and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over. i became angered that i had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap. tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art.

i will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.the simple plot is.. well.. simple. i got to the point where i didn't care if they destroy the building or not. if i had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, i swear i would hurl the dvd out the window. and there's also the protagonist. they try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert! sniffing the girls bra, sneaking peeks at her when she's naked, putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps, putting her bra on a blow up sex doll (which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll.. umm)what irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting. in the photo gallery on the dvd, you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint (digitally too).. the film looked a lot better without the effect.. so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy... bah. i could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap..i think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 - 10 minutes. this doesn't compare to delicatessen ( like so many are tryign to do). delicatessen has characters you can get into and like.. these people here just grunt and giggle.lastly, i would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a german impressionistic film liek the old silents. one of the problems with most foreign, especially artsy, films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the 'space' of the scene. it results in the audience not really understanding what;s going on because they don't get a sense of the space of the surroundings.anyway, it's rubbish. the short film on the dvd, surprise, was a heckuva lot better.

i always say, "there's nothing like a good movie". and i must say, this was nothing like a good movie! drab, dull and tedious. it was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. i don't mind the concept of a film without words, (ie: entering a fantasy or dream world), but there has to be something there to capture your imagination, not just empty images, which is what this film is. there seemed to be no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to discern any story. (was there even a story?) you could tell the actors were trying their best, but unfortunately, poor direction sabotaged all the actors' work. it really seemed like a type of cinematic masturbation...only existing to pleasure the director and nobody else. big waste of time.

i had a different experience with this movie - it never got charming, or delightful, or funny for me. one big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the ianguage(s) spoken in the film. another was the lack of choices re subtitles.i found the lack of dialogue annoying, especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was. the wildly inconsistent development of the feeble plot was puzzling. were there characters, or only vague gestures? was there even a plot?on a separate matter, i'm getting prompted to correct the spelling of "dialogue", with the suggested substitute of "dialogue". maybe this movie in its entirety, including the imdb portion, is designed to puzzle, or amaze, but i'm getting more irked than amused.

like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of jeunet & caro or emir kusturica. but have you already seen delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. i thought delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. i don't think it's a worse film than delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch delicatessen again. there is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you. there may be a distant similarity to the films of kusturica, but he's really in a different league, so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on tuvalu.

you know, this is one of those "emperor's new clothes" films. it's like, so off the wall and strange that you're supposed to like it if you're really into film. well, i think that's a bunch of bologna. films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts. some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. i have bizarre dreams too, sometimes, that make absolutely no sense but i don't feel the need to put them on film, expose everybody else to them and call it art. weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it. if other people don't get it, that doesn't make it profound, it just makes it incomprehensible. bizarreness for bizarreness sake, for me, is not good, let alone great, art. and comparing "tuvalu" to "delicatesen" is like comparing "the godfather i & ii" to "the godfather iii"---same genre, not in the same league.

one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far: the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.as nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! the cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. in comparison, the one of the "shining" is funfair! nb: a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera! they are wrong! it isn't the south of france (nice, cannes) but totally the opposite: cabourg & normandy, to be simple the beaches of the d-day! that's why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn't sun!

it seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. some manage to do so with great talent. hervé hadmar doesn't. on the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very "décalé" style. director hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. the movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade. what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.

this movie really sucks. this is my second review because its so bad. the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not. i cant believe it was rated r there is basiaclly no violence, no sex, no nudity, no swearing nothing. really crap film.

bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, implausible, bad dialogue... this movies is bad, bad, bad. however, if you want a movie to poke fun at (a la mst3000), this is your movie. i wouldn't suggest spending much money on it, but if you do see this movie, make sure it's with plenty of witty, like-minded buddies.

i saw this on cable. someone had to lose their job for greenlighting this one for air. just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown! savage instinct should be shown in all film classes. it is the perfect template for how to not make a movie. the editing alone is so jumbled you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained (poorly) monkeys, traveling across unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. the audio is often not legible. acting? i can't call anything i saw here acting. reciting? hmmm. can't call it that either. failing? that works. all that being said...it is hilarious! i cannot stress enough that there is not one redeemable factor in this "film" other than the hilarity derived from it's own incredible ineptness. fun, in a strictly masochistic sort of way. watch it...if you dare.

if you like really shocking movies this is for you. the acting is the worst i've ever seen and the story line goes no-where. if you come across this film in your video shop don't even consider borrowing it. the chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie.i gave this movie 1/10 only because i couldn't vote 0. avoid it at all costs.

susan inadvertently stumbles onto a drug smuggling ring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house. the leader of said drug ring, mongo (whom only has one week until retirement) thinking she knows much more than this bubbly blond actually does seeks to make sure she won't tell anyone anything and thus begins one of the more bone headed films that i've sat through.all the actors in this film can't really act in the least. susan makes a pretty ineffectual hero for most of the movie (she'd never escape multiple times if not for the fact that seemingly every one in the movie wants to have sex with her) and she doesn't take the offensive until the last 20 minutes of the flick. when she does she spouts some generic "i have had enough" line, preach on sister, that very thought ran through my mind multiple times when i was watching this my grade: d-

this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. it really does not qualify for movie status. it is very cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. it looked like a home video! i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. it is that bad. i noticed the name from whence this cameasylumand i will never rent anything with that name on it again!!! when you rent a flick, check to see if it is from this "company." one thing is true though--if you like horribly acted, amateur movies, then you might like this loser. it is absolutely boring and terrible!!! you have been warned!!!

i had to suffer through this movie three times while i was a zombie extra in the director's new movie after sundown. the first time that i saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. i could not take it any more i busted out laughing right in front of the guy. the movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (female nudity) was nowhere to be found. i am a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was just too much for me. the worst part was that i had to watch it so many times. also do not expect the new movie to be any better.

the fanglys is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of christ or something, i mean halloween isn't that important is it? anyway, sheriff pete (burton gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned (co-associate producer john william galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. could it be the fang lady (justin hamilton)? the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows? being the fun sort of guy he is mark (asisstant director & producer robert harvey) convinces his missus kelly (laurie reeves) to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven (josh gobin) found the night before for a halloween party. the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly & she agrees, along with steven & a girl he picked up named camille (natalie woods) & their nerdy friend jerry (tim boswell) they all set out for a night of fun, well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. however they soon discover that the legend of the fang lady is far from the bedtime story many make out...edited, executive produced, written & directed by christopher abram the fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film. the script is very predictable, dull & doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever, in the right hands & with a decent budget the fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't. it moves along at a fair pace but the on-screen 'action' is so poor that it doesn't matter, i don't quite know what else to say other than the fanglys is a really bad film & i can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it. the dialogue is basic, the character's are clichéd & lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time. there are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage? i'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. oh, if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed, assuming you can actually make it that far of course (believe me it takes some doing).director abram doesn't do anything special. abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish, i can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods. there's no atmosphere, scares, tension, excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good. forget about decent gore, there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm & a pitchfork stuck through someones throat.apparently the fanglys had a filming budget of $2,837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release, & to be brutally honest it shows. what about the retarded guy & his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous? the terrible special effects, the camcorder cinematography & the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through.the fanglys is straight-to-video crap, it has no redeeming features whatsoever & it's low imdb user rating score is fully justified, it's one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock & wishing the thing would just finish.

this film is terrible - honestly. the acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which i usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. of course, before that it has the cliché "you really believe that? ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged out for a while. the witch's cannibal son was made a retard (i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy, but this film failed at both). it has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad film even worse. heck, the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene, and even that could of been better.honestly, don't even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly don't consider buying or renting this, else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.

yes, it's a sbif (so bad it's funny) classic. with a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. blood looked like watered-down cherry koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the "human" bones, and miss witch had the cheapest mask wal-mart could provide.did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was? most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms, it would be career suicide to have this on your resume. do yourself a favor and watch ebert's video of his colonoscopy instead!

i went into this movie with an open mind. i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. i promised him i wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise. we kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.this "movie" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100. i really don't know how this got distributed. the lighting was poor. i have seen better acting in elementary school plays. there is really nothing positive to say about it.

director john madden, of shakespeare in love fame, gives us another pretty bad film in ethan frome. the plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of starkfield where he learns the story of the local crippled man ethan frome's sick wife and one-time romantic tryst with the maid. adapted by richard nelson from pulitzer prize-winning author edith wharton's novel, this film isn't interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz. still, there are other aspects apart of the film that work - the cinematography is well done, rachel portman contributes a lovely score, and while no one is at their best, liam neeson, joan allen, patricia arquette, and tate donovan work well in their roles. but overall, ethan frome is only marginally worthwhile and is easily forgotten.

john madden's cinematic interpretation of edith wharton's ethan frome falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece. while the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film. madden fails to convey the innocence, and overall tragedy of ethan and mattie's relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale. the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog. zeena (zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the books least sympathetic figure, where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on. the book more accurately describes zeena's tyrannical control of the house and of ethan. the movie just ticked me off. the addition of the fox was pointless, as well as the scene with mattie trying to kill herself. it was just poorly interpreted and done. film mistakes: ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with denis eady, addition of love scene, fox scene, store scene, saying his plans allowed, lack of displays of ethan's inner emotions and thoughts, introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer, let on to much that zeena knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what zeena is thinking or aware of. just too many flaws and poor directing decisions.

although i found the acting excellent, and the cinematography beautiful, i was extremely disappointed with the adaptation.one of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that ethan and mattie decide to kill themselves, rather than go on. this is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledding accident.the character changes in mattie and zenna are almost non-existent. while in the novella they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids.lastly that mattie and ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale.the change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change.neeson and arquette are superb in their portrayals. joan allen was also wonderful, however her character was much watered down from whartons novella.i do not expect films to faithfully portray novels, but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story.overall, i would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed.

let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film. for the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. it seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid. the crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog? uhhhhhhh. ok. overall, a fat stinking 1/10. not worth your time.

i'd heard this japanese flick is edgy, creatively interesting, a "cool new thang" on the asian movie-making scene ... maybe even something as innovative as hideo nakata's "ringu" or chan-wook park's "oldboy", especially the latter.you can imagine my disappointment when, instead, i found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically (though not in a way that a film aficionado appreciates), cliché-ridden, even sadly silly instead of funny --- on the whole, a very bad knock- off of the "pulp fiction" style.i stopped watching after 30 minutes, when i gave up on it becoming something more than it is.

what has rajiv rai done to himself? once a hit director of films like tridev and vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. i was initially excited at the thought of rajiv rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. as a rajiv rai fan i thought i should at least give it a go but i left after an hour. one reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of paki- bashing in the film, this was not in rai's previous venture.a lot of directors have tried paki- bashing but i did not expect it from rajiv rai another letdown was the music. rajiv rai's have always had good music until now. there is only one good song and that is tere dekh dekh ladgayan. the performances are not upto scratch, not even from rai loyalist naseer-uddin- shah. avoidable fare from once my favourite director.

watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! had a choice between lakshya and asambhav...(realized then i should have gone for lakshya). a typical plot...india v pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have kashmir in the middle. an indian super hero goes on a mission to save the president of india from some pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. i left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place. the songs were also awful, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately they are outdated too.overall...avoid it if you can, has to be the worst film i've seen this year.

a pretentious but - to varying degrees - watchable collection of mostly pointless "stories".but let's start from the top.kaurismaki: if one ever wondered what finnish love/romance was like, perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication. subdued feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia! i guess the sequel to this story will be "for our honeymoon we move from siberia to greenland". aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie, so he just made up some half-assed non-"story" centering around a band he particularly likes (or maybe they're his friends) because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters.erice: first off, i've never heard of this guy before  and now i know why. nice black&white photography and pretty much nothing else - unless being bored silly can be considered an asset. but you'd be surprised how many movie-critics and film students love boredom in movies so i hotly recommend erice's 10-minute snooze-fest to those two groups of humanoids.herzog: not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about tribes in south america. this isn't a short film but a report, but considering how dull the first two entries were, herzog's bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments, and if nothing else fits into the movie's pretentious "time" concept very neatly.jarmusch: as was to be almost expected, this once-interesting film-maker (with the brain of a peanut; a talented idiot savant) serves us yet another doze of pointlessness. he has become lazy and can't be bothered to write anything interesting, either for his own movies or a collection such as tmo. the only bright side in watching how a dumb veggie actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely chloe sevigny. otherwise, skip this nonsense. oh, and btw: i don't believe that any young actress listens to classical music; was jarmusch trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music? does lindsey lohan perhaps listen to opera? maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan? who am i to say they aren't?!jim jarmusch is a moron. oh, right... i already mentioned that...wenders: here is the actual shock of the whole movie: wenders can actually make something good!!!!!? everything else i've seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and pointless. however, this short little story is done with style(!  atypical) and is the best part of the movie. it leaves one wanting to see more of it, even though the story has a resolution.spike lee: oh, dear lord what can i say here? lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison. like herzog, he chooses not a story but submits a report  and a left-wing political propaganda report at that! cnn, but in black and white, and one-sided, of course. naturally, "we wuz robbed", the retarded title of this little sleep-inducer, is about how the poor, gullible and infinitely idealistic democrats wuz robbed by bush and his evil evil team of thieves. this is by far the dumbest and dullest entry in this movie, and i had to utilize the fast-forward button so as not to doze off. spike lee truly is a product of affirmative action. god knows how many really talented (black) directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runt keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them. and he gets it wrong every time! now that does take some kind of talent, right? kaige: the chinese story has a solid premise. it's okay, nothing more.all in all, there are many and far better movies to spend your time on, but if your time isn't that valuable (as is apparently the case with my own) you can check this little film out."ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of anti-masters of cinema. time is precious. waste it on better movies." - fedor miklowitz, 1588

i have been reading comments on imdb for some time now. an 8.3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves. i don't mean to pull one of those "i just signed up for an account so i can post on this movie" bits..... but, i just did. the only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed.now, i realize many 'hoity-toity' film people love this movie; nevertheless, it is crap. the thing that really gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the 'villain' in the movie. if you do have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. just my personal feelings i guess. yet, i sat through 2 hours of this *expletive* expecting some really deep reasoning behind dae-soo's imprisonment.i tend to like a lot of foreign movies, but this is my first encounter with a korean flick and it has put them last in line in my book. oh... i feel better already after a little venting.

let me get this out of the way before i trash this film: i love park chan-wook's work as a director. while i disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, i can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. i really liked one of his other films, sympathy for mr. vengeance. also, min-sik choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.now the bad: the plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature. i'll never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being cliché, then hail movies like oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so. regardless, oldboy is flat-out one of the most generic, unoriginal movies ever conceived. *spoilers* man is held captive, man seeks revenge, man finds out he had sex with a family member, man's life is over. *end spoilers* simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies/books in between. it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens, i laughed out loud. does that mean i'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? no. what it means overdone plots make people laugh. the scary movie franchise proved that, and oldboy proved it as well. why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichés masked with fancy camera-work and classical music? that brings up the issue of blood/gore. simply put, it isn't there. the director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something "gory" happens, as if we're watching a children's movie or something. maybe we were. anyway, i've heard oldboy called the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever" but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing. all the "gore" is off-screen, and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in pg-13 movies like the dark knight or casino royale before. why this even got an r-rating confuses me, much less "the most brutal movie of all time". seriously, i've seen movies that just make oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence/gore.the other huge glaring, cheesy flaw is the main villain. the majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american pie-style, but i'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? when he's wearing clothes, his hair is slicked back like a bad asian mix of the cheesiest james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers. he talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again. seriously, oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year . . .in the end, oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties. it's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are, and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the "films" (never "movies") they enjoy are.to those people all i can say is this: i like "films" and also like "movies". i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma. but the thing is, for me to like both "films" and "movies", they have to be original. they have to be something i haven't seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. when something isn't original, it's expendable. if it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. before you give oldboy yet another perfect rating because it "touched" you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie equally as touching, but at the same time original make you think more? i just wish someone other than me would understand this.overall: oldboy is forgettable and cheesy.1/10

... so some people might argue that this can't possible be the worst movie ever made, and no it's not. i have seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on.so why do i hate this movie über alles? well, it's basically about a man, who gets kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but***major spoilers stop reading if you don't want to know*** our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won't tell her, because she didn't know. it is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. and why did he deserve this? because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment - in the wrong way. he went on and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. and viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that. i have wondered: maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh. maybe because i feel this movie doesn't condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. maybe it's because i expected something else.***end of spoilers***believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end, and i'm very serious; you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? well, i felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie, and i really wish i'd never seen it. it stayed with me for days, and some might ask: well, isn't that the purpose of a good movie? the ability to affect us in such ways? yes, it can be, but this movie not only made me sick, it made me feel violated.

when one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, i obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.the two hours i spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.i understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. this movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. a lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.the acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough. maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but i hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between dae su and migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film. then again, maybe this film was just bad.i am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. throughout all the fight scenes i felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.and the plot? the word laughable comes to mind. i would be amused if i hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, i was expecting something interesting to conclude it. i won't discuss the ending, because i wouldn't want to "spoil" the movie for those who haven't seen it. just that the metaphor "be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same." cannot be used as an explanation for everything.this entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only. i just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is. i've seen many other great korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed oldboy as the best.

*****classic ****excellent ***good **fair *tragicreview:oldboy is not for everyone. it's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.the film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years, oh dae-su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.it's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a south korean thriller should be. oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.verdict:not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog.*tragic

there's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. forced acting. forced takes. forced plot. even forced photography. there's people who say "the movie develops that way because it's from asia" but i don't see any kind of forced elements on seven samurai or sonatine. there's a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it's way, fiction) and being just unlikely.in a more personal way, i just don't feel anything with the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and i just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed. it just doesn't feel right, there's something in it or through that just doesn't click.

oldboy is set in korea & starts as a drunken dae-su oh (min-sik choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. however before dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty mido (hye-jeong kang) the two fall in love & together with her help dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...this south korean production was co-written & directed by chan-wook park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the grand prize of the jury at cannes while it was also nominated for the golden palm so surely oldboy is a true classic? well not for me it isn't since as i can't understand why it's so liked & i would go as far as to say i pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. for a start i couldn't get into the story at all, i just didn't like it as i thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. the ending in which dae-su goes to the new zealand alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that i would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. in fact oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. i didn't warm to any of the character's & while i accept oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that i will never understand why so many people seem to like.based on a japanese manga of the same name oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot i was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. the actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, dae-su eats a live octopus which is apparently quite normal in korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.the budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in south korea & new zealand. the acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.oldboy is a film that i found an absolute chore to sit through, i don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as i followed the thing perfectly but i just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. apparently the second in director choi-wook park's revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy for mr. vengeance (2002) & lady vengeance (2005).

this movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. while i like how the director, chan-wook park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was terrible. oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. i will say that the english dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. i felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing hye-jeong kang (she plays mi-do) speak. if you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away. if you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fight scenes, gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this is not the movie for you.

please do not blame korea for this bad movie. i am in korea (please excuse bad english). it sadden me to see these movies which make korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. it sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear americans say that is how korea is. we do not eat live animals!! so please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! there is scenes with the man eating live animals and non koreans think it is normal. no it is disgusting to us too. the director is a misfit, sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. i wish america and france will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. please watch any other movie from korea, that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. this movie is rubbish.

unbelievable. "philosophy". "depth". "genius". "masterpiece". people must have seen another "oldboy" because the one i've seen was a badly written, poorly conceived, over-the-top-acted, sordid piece of "kraapola" which, even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child, could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years old.the "depth" of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom, "laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you'll find yourself alone", the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author, be him shakespeare or, more to the point of imdb, kurosawa, would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts. where this movie should have landed too, if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once "great art". in short, yuck.2 out of 100. it's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera-work. in no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness, though.

it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence. in fact violence, both disturbing and cartoonish, is the last of "oldboy"'s deep flaws. the characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. the "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. by the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue to "shock" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera "revelations" already served up in big bunches. it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash. imagine homer simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater: "should i go in or should i buy five cones of ice-cream for the same money?" be smart, homer, go for the ice-cream.

i am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. just a little background about me: i like and know a lot about asian cinema, especially japanese, chinese and indian. admittedly i am a novice when it comes to south-korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. i just want you to know that i am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and i do not fit the stereotype of the "dumb american" . . . well, not perfectly.i cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. this is a disgusting *and* ludicrous movie. hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone, like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. horrible camera-work, with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the mtv aesthetics.the plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of swiss cheese. nobody expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment i'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. but, excuse me, what's happening here that *can* stand even summary scrutiny? this story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (don't want to spoil your "enjoyment", if that's the word, so won't go into details of the plot.) the fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time, after he only trained while imprisoned, punching a wall ! ) the truly "outstanding" features of this movie are two: the lurid and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we've evolved since oedipus, didn't we?) and the graphic violence. the cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made?) have no esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.a feast for the s & m inclined, admittedly, but, even for those, a feast of no merit nor subtlety. heavens, even mel gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't that bad.the invariably good press this pretentious, overblown, overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from korean shores obtains makes me wonder what's happening. i don't think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often i am ready to accept that a movie i didn't enjoy may be better than i was able to perceive. however, i have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as i see it: bad, bad, bad. no redeeming qualities. my 2c? find something better to do with your time.

this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which i find frankly puzzling. the reasons why i didn't like this title are following:1. the directer must have had some doubts whether to make a jackie-chan-type of a flick or a dark oedipian tragedy. as a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. the characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing. psychological truth and logic are sadly missing.3. absurd casting. i don't blame the actors, for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone, if there is scarce logic in the script. however, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors, whose ages in the film can't differ by more than 3-4?4. to me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. if you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest. when you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist, it turns out to make no sense.5. some films apart from being entertaining are also thought-provoking. having seen this film, i began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful. i cannot put any other construction on the ending. 6. the film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. violence in a film (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it serves an important and worthy purpose. purposes can be different and i don't want to enter into this broad subject. let me just say i don't object to violence in such films as "saving private ryan", "the passion of the christ" or "the pulp fiction". in "oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or aural). what for? i do not know. personally, i don't derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc. etc. 7. the film reminds me a little of japanese porno mangas in its fixation on incest and young asian girls' panties, urinating and the like. it appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing. if you're one of them, you might find this film enjoyable.in short, i do not recommend this film either as entertainment or "food for thought". where it isn't silly, it is disgusting. don't waste your time.

this movie was awful, plain and simple. it will probably be revered by those who only see "films" and not "movies" and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but i am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully drawn-out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars.i was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies, perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday.the storyline is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knowing his captor nor his crime. he is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. however, the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as oh dae-su runs around beating people up, trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live, writhing squid (presumably for dramatic effect, as there is absolutely no other reason for it). all the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail, and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown. his nemesis, a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man, looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him. hey, i know prison has been hard on oh dae-su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age? of all the things wrong with this movie, this one seems like the easiest one to fix.and the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when i could have been out doing something productive - is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. come on! throw us a bone here - was that really the best they could do? i sat through stupid dialogue, over-acting, gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this? (by the way - i'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story, but in this case it seems i was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out i was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage).take my advice - do something else with your time and money. or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly "movie" - one that you might actually enjoy.

by jove, what an unholy mess! revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big "surprises" (which actually tend to be about as "revelatory" as the national enquirer's headlines). add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. this movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience. (for by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness, without "oldboy"s vulgar excesses, i recommend an older dutch/french movie, "the vanishing".) well, don't believe there's absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. in fact there is. the (in)famous scene in which the hero (is really a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then attempts to obtain forgetfulness rather than redemption?) eats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. too bad the poor beast, having been eaten, couldn't survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless diploma, for the "best actor", at the cannes festival. which festival, by the way, between moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness, became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous.sic transit gloria mundi!

it's boring.it's slow.where are the nasty and brutal murders? where is the tension that is supposed to scare us? this is like watching sesame street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or grover.it's really lame.maybe it was the writing...maybe the direction...maybe the acting, maybe the editing, maybe the cinematography, maybe the special effects, maybe the makeup.maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on.i wanted to get scared...not bored.this didn't scare me...it didn't even interest me...i had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this film.don't bother to buy it..and if you see it on television by some freak chance, there is no need to tuck the kids asleep.

it's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. the dialog was unnatural. especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. i guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. the suspense just wasn't there. the music was about as bad as it gets. the only reason i watched this movie was because i live in the death valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen. fortunately the movie was on tv and so i didn't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film! i honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here. it's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash! i guess the only positive thing i can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.

i truly love horror films & try to give every one i see as much credit (or sometimes more) as possible, but this is really pushing the ticket...most of the cast were very like-able but hardly any of them could act at all - but then again think about the writing/dialogue of this mess...some good make-up but absolutely ridiculous special fx. all in all i give it 3 out of 10 - & am having second thoughts about that!!

in another of the dreadful horror films i seem so masochistically attracted to, we have a bunch of friends stuck in a haunted house slowly being killed one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that spurt yellow blood and have very bad dental problems. the first 45 minutes is all talk however, and considering the young thespians cannot act their way out of a paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue ever to dispassionately recite, this is especially painful to sit through. if you manage to stay awake through that nonsense, things don't get any better.. with bad make-up galore and cheesy, bargain basement (not-so-special) effects. as for the conclusion.. well, what's the betting that the old-timer who warned them against going to the spooky mansion in the first place will turn up and save the day for the last two survivors (a boy and a girl, of course) with his mystical powers? please.. life is too short for these kind of movies. donate the time you would otherwise have spent watching this tripe helping out the community, do a couple of shifts in a soup kitchen or something. you'll feel you've actually done something productive with your life, and you won't have put money into the pockets of studios who churn out irredeemable rubbish such as this.unfortunately, it's already too late for me.. now, where did i put that copy of 'pumpkinhead'? 1/10

i've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it truly gets funnier every time. perhaps what i enjoy most is the tired character paradigms that the movie offers us: the somber all-american male protagonist, his blonde girlfriend, the theater nerd with glasses, a brunette girl, the antagonistic jock, and brunette girl #2. however, we're then presented with two magician martial arts experts with mullets driving a convertible. if anyone can explain that, please contact me. among other highlights are bobby johnston's portrayal of the jock character, dell, and his trademark line, "that's why i keep her around." in watching johnston's performance, it comes as no surprise that his career quickly descended into the realm of soft-core porn. (spoiler) also, after multiple viewings, i still have absolutely no idea what that big demon at the end says at any point; it's just electronically muffled noises. oh well, that's probably for the better. and lastly, why are all the demons so slippery? is wet skin scarier? it certainly didn't help in this film.

wow. i just saw demon wind a little while ago, and i don't think i'll ever be the same. it has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually.never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those halloween green marshmallows.or so much naked old lady, for that matter. but then, there was "the shining."the plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog. the last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description. it's like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw bruce willis type dialog together with (i guess?) teenybopper dialog from some elm street film. the result is jarring, and it'd be truly funny if it was intended that way.ah, what the hey. i'll laugh anyway.hell, get together with your friends and watch this. but make absolutely sure you're drunk first. or, you may go insane. particularly if you're a college film student.cheers.

i had just finished reading the book, and was really looking forward to seeing this tv adaptation which was broadcast on the hallmark channel on monday night (5/30/05). the key to the whole book was the manifesto which was stolen by the man with steel teeth, but i watched for an hour (out of 3 1/2) and i saw the man with the steel teeth but i never saw him steal a manifesto. i saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book? it's too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast, but isn't the idea of turning a book into a movie (tv or film) to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience. they only kept me for an hour. i thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise. this book had a great mcguffin (to paraphrase hitchcock) but they ignored it. and it said in the titles that forsyth was involved in the production. they sure must have paid him a lot of money.

frederick forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. this adaptation had none of that.so much of what was great in the book (the history of monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission. this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on.swayze's monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying "i am a secret agent" for all the attention that he called to himself during the film. and with all of that attention, the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising.granted there was some energy to this film, which is why i'm giving it a "3" instead of a "1". it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin, ben cross, michael york, and barry morse.i hope that someday, someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like "day of the jackal" did.

stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push the doctor (billy gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting ollie strung up to the ceiling. when the situation calms down, stan gets ollie's clothes, as the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving (which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) classic comedy, it isn't great, but it's a black and white film worth looking at. stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian. okay!

this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. i've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. this show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. i dislike that crap..i have no iq why they completely changed the theme of this show. the first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. the 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. i seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up. many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd. i will only watch the first season of this show from now on, whenever i see a new episode, ill change the f*ckin channel...ya heard me! it gets a 3/10 because i somewhat enjoyed the 1st season but hated the 2nd and 3rd

this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. this show has completely changed around. in the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. its more about her life and dating. ever since that gay kid (ben) came along, this show has sucked. the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. disney took a turn for the worse. i cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore, they're all garbage.

i think that it was just like lizzie mcguire except that it was a lot worse than the original. the only thing that is different is that she likes animals and science and all of that geeky stuff. everything else is the same. she likes a guy that she is too nervous to ask out. and later she finds a guy that does like her and she has no clue. i think that people need to quit making that same kind of shows. and another thing that is the same is that it is always thaw the friends are two girls and one guy. don't people think that these things get old and tired and these ideas keep being used over and over and yet they keep using these ideas. but i do know people who watch this show and i know that they like them.

when i first saw this show i thought to my self " what is this!!!!!?" its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered "huge". then there's sadie. this complete misfit for her friends and well her family. shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another lizzie miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!) shes also very perfect like most tv girls are which makes me sick! so please this is a stupid show it makes no sense just skip it unless you liked lizzie mcguire or any other shows like that.

naturally sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen, it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. i didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, it was all awful jokes.the acting sucks, many of the characters sucked at acting, charlotte arnold (sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters suck too (magaret, rain, hal).the plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable. this is one of the worst shows made of all time, it shouldn't have even been made, the idiots who are responsible of writing this garbage should get fired (if they already didn't) the fist season was actually watchable but the second season was just a disaster, its too hard to watch this show, it is beyond awful.

when this show first came to disney, i love it started watching all the time. it quickly became one of my favorite disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.i do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. i hat that garbage. the first season was very unique because it showed sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. the first season was very entertaining. i mostly don't like the second season because of ben. he annoys me and pisses the crap outta me. the plot in the second season also sucks and is just awful

omg what has disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. suite life of zach and cody are pretty good but other shows like cory in the house, wizards of waverly place suck and are unwatchable.naturally sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. its about a teenager named sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. there are her friends margaret and rain and her older annoying brother hal. there all annoying and stupid. especially margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful. i hate all the seasons of this show, its just terrible in every way (the first season was better though).if you value your life, you wouldn't watch this crap, its painful and stupid

every time i by pass this show on tv, i absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes out, and rip my ears off.it's so unbelievably horrible.the jokes aren't funny, the acting is completely terrible, and the whole entire show is one major disappointment.i hate charlotte arnold's guts, and i just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time i hear her talk. she is a no talent, low iq, big waste on society, and i think she would be doing the world a favor if she just shuts the f*ck up and went away for a long time. please, i say this with all my heart, do not even watch one episode of this show!!!!!!it's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself, than watch this show for half an hour.

naturally sadie sucks big time, i have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage. this is not funny, its not cute in any way shape or form, its just disturbing and a waste of money. sadie is such a bad actor. i lost all my brain cells watching this show, it honestly seemed that this show is forced, it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap.this show sucks.its a waste of time, and money, don't bother watching this garbage. the characters are so stupid and ridiculous. in the first season its just dumb and stupid then when i saw the second season i just couldn't take anymore, it made me want to kill charlotte arnold. the second season is juts absolutely a disgrace to disney this show is also a racist piece of sh**

the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie. the commercial showed sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.it is one of the stupidest commercials i've ever seen. basically, they go back and forth with lines like "nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,". when i saw that, i figured it would be yet another lame lizzie maguire knockoff by disney. but i had no idea how bad.fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the t.v. naturally sadie happened to be on. what i saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows i've ever seen. how'd it go? something like this:sadie, a vegetarian tree hugger, has an incredibly unhealthy,obsessive crush on the very monotone and poorly acted acted out owen. for some reason, her friend margret decides that owen needs to be "tested" to see if he is as good as he seems. what exactly do these tests involve? well, one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook. why? so that she can be squeamish and ask her monotone knight in shining armor to get it off.how is this a test? because if he squishes it, he's mean and uncaring and doesn't believe that bugs, as sadie puts it, "are innocent animals too,". they spread disease and pestilance! they deserve to be squished! but of course, owen just brushes it out the window, and sadie is still in love. but that's not all! margret says he needs to be challenged one more time, on something that "no guy can pass". this one involves shoving scarves down their pants( yes, you read that right)and walking buy him to see if he notices their large butts. predictably, he doesn't notice, and we see sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world. sadie decides that she wants to be with owen forever,raise a family with him, and as she puts it, "live like wood ducks with their brood,". that's just plain wrong.bottom line: this is the strangest, most insane show i've watched. for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff, you'll love it. for anyone else, skip this show.

i do not find this show at all funny. i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sit-coms right now. charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play sadie, because she can't act. the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and i mean little bit) of acting talent is justin bradley as sadie's brother hal. jasmine richards and michael d'ascenzo portray sadie's friends. there both really stupid and just terrible actors. two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny. it's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet. now i've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor, what's next? the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. she changed again (not so sciencey an ben-loving) and suddenly nobody recognizes her? it's moronic. in summation, i hate this show, however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it, so i guess that's what they're going for over quality. although i can say as much as, the first season is clearly better than the second.bottom line: just don't watch any of it.my rating: awful show. tv g. 30 mins.

for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. ivan kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. viola essen at the time was with ballet theater, now american ballet theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but except for dame judith anderson, the acting is amateurish and checkov is completely over the top .... embarrassingly so! i saw this film at age 14 and at that time, never having seen a ballet, i was very impressed. however, later in life, long after i had completed my own career as a dancer - i purchased the video tape of it, curious as to what it was like after so many years. i couldn't believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet. but it was made in the mid 40s, before the red shoes or the turning point, the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world. the entire cast of spectre have now passed away ... ivan kirov (not his real name)dying at age 79. it was his one and only film, thereafter being kept by a chicago business man .. so the rumor goes.

with actors like depardieu and richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. but weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. this movie is high on story but low on character. you never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. unfortunately weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. his style could be described at hit and miss. of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. weber directs his humor at this lot. it is a shame how bad he uses good talent. many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors.

this movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. one of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available.the good : 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about theresa chanthe bad :the main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman theresa chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. no linkage between the 3 story lines. minimum dialogue in the film, substituted by smss and chat programs on pc. no cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.

i literally ran to watch it, expecting a film that will make me cry, or touch my heart.what i found was not heart-rending, but a lame exploitation of 1 strong human character.interwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man.in a setting that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most common.it was not entirely bad, as i have seen worst - and i left the cinema $10 poorer but wiser - that a film well advertised is not the same as a film well-made.

'be with me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. just leave it running in the background. chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end. alas, as i watched it alone, and so i felt like i almost watched the world's worst, longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and i then managed (just a) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a 'thank you' to the movie's sponsors - which included asia pacific breweries. aha! methought: how surprising is *that* - given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie? meanwhile, dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth, but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movie's overall story is said or witnessed. it's as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and you'd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency, or part of its plot, as far as the movie's overall progression was concerned. thus the ultimate "wallpaper movie"!well i wonder... what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching? i wonder and continue to wonder... it certainly couldn't have been this arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a camera's rolling. allegedly, 'be with me' is supposed to be woven around the themes of "love, tragedy and redemption". but all i witnessed was boredom, a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages, and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended. what a wistful waste of time, it ended up being! it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a "remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities..." well, no disrespect to ms chan, but given that she was such a marvellous & amazing character, why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together? yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling. rather than tying in the fates of all characters, i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concerned.i am generally an art-house movie fan and don't usually object to slow pacing (of which here there is no shortage, believe you me!!). i hate such movies as 300, transformers, fight club, but consider, e.g., eric rohmer as a great film maker. so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective. nonetheless, there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movie's conception and delivery which could prevent one's eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of 'be with me' dripped by. watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time. otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it. 3/10

when i saw this movie three years ago, i thought it exemplified a lot of the traits found in singapore art-house movies: slow-moving, with a minimal of plot and dialogue, depending on film composition to make it work.during then, amongst local cineastes, the inability to appreciate "be with me" is tantamount to panning "citizen kane" or any of ozu's late films. i've no idea how "be with me" reached such hallowed heights in singapore's cinematic consciousness, but i always felt that khoo's "12 storeys" is a better film, even though the latter film does not boast as good a cinematographer as adrian tan, khoo's dp for "be with me". "12 storeys" has a story that better relates to most singaporeans and has bite too, something that "be with me"'s threadbare wistfulness doesn't have."be with me" is basically a barely interlinked trio of narratives strung together into a film by khoo and his screenwriter wong kim hoh. it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance; two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of deaf-and-blind teresa chan."be with me" is very well filmed by tan, using a varicam camera. the film compositions are masterful. the film, almost entirely silent, has next to no dialogue. characters move around, not in a realistic manner, but almost as if they are models under the instruction of a director, almost always looking into the screen and emoting: either loneliness or sadness. unfortunately the characters don't act against each other. this kind of film has been seen before many times: in tsai ming-liang's films, in khoo's protégé royston tan's "4:30" and elsewhere. sadly, its ultra-slowness (essentially plot less) and use of a lento piano soundtrack simply doesn't appeal to me.to criticize "be with me" seems almost to negate the inspirational story behind it, that of teresa chan, who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this, yet i'm afraid this film doesn't do anything much to me. i'm willing to applaud chan's steadfast and courageous march in life and tan's striking cinematography, but for a better take on the same subject-matter with more meat (without the two other tedious and distracting subplots), try werner herzog's "land of silence and darkness" (1971).

i am in a movie club at my school and i was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. the film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal. the acting was absolutely dreadful. the children were overly whiny. a metal pole could have done a better job. i wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, i was kept from peace. the monkey's are neither cute, nor are they funny. the drama is laugh-worthy. i cannot remember when i saw a more dreadful film. the story is weak, thin, predictable, and completely fake. the adults try to be good actors, but they just can't seem to break through stereotypes. the girl even appears to want to leave the film via falling off a hill during the movie in order to leave it, i don't blame her. micheal anderson should publicly apologize for this film. not just to me, but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film. in fact, i apologize to you. even if i had nothing to do with this project, i apologize for this film, because this means at least someone will. this film even surpasses the dismalness of films that of rob schneider and the cheetah girls. i would even go as far to say that it is even worse that hilary duff's collection of films, but that's pushing it. just please don't see this film, or else you'll be pushed to write a review similar to this one on how awful this film is. i'm very sorry.

wow! i truly regret watching this picture... funny, i agreed to see it just for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing it about a half an hour before retiring, while i stayed in front of the tv, but only to feed the the masochistic in me and i because i wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeemable aspects which might alleviate the feeling i had of being a stupid for watching this **** called two girls and a guy...everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong... since the initial, absurd, premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend, until the awful, but merciful, end, not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors... don't believe the rumors, the junkie's acting is bad and i don't see how graham has made herself a known name within the movie industry...i wonder why, after the producers saved some bucks with just three actors and an only location, they didn't hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his ***...at least, i felt a little fine when i destroyed the dvd and threw it to the trash... anyway, i liked somehow (and just a little) the brunette actress, natasha something, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of face-off (changing faces), so two girls and a guy to the bottom goes... stay away from this ****!

uh, oh! i just said the this "classic" film has a plot that stinks! well, it's true,...so get over it! this film was a vanity project for joseph p. kennedy in which his mistress starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. today, only a fragmentary copy exists--one that was retored a few years back. however, even if the film had been in perfect shape, it still would have stunk for many reasons. and, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: first, gloria swanson, aged 31 plays a girl in a convent school--perhaps aged 16 or 18! come on--she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids.second, the movie all hinges on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". while some people believe it this, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away everything on a woman he didn't even know! what a lot of hooey! third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts! after leaving the school, kelly goes off to east africa and then becomes "queen of the whores"--and later, after the evil queen back in europe dies (that's convenient), the prince is able to get out of prison, actually finds kelly and marries her and she then becomes queen of a real honest-to-goodness country! gimme a break--this is ridiculous, even in the days of silent film this plot was a groaner!so, in summary, this is a poor film with great production values (mistresses need to look good) that is parading around as a classic! there are so many better silent films out there--see them first and avoid this tripe.

i can't believe this terrible film was made by the same people who made lepa sela lepo gore. watch that and skip this. the plot is muddled and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. i suspect the editor went on vacation halfway through the film because quick, choppy cuts start to appear that only confuse matters rather than elucidate them. the ending doesn't make sense either.this is predominantly a propaganda film made so serbs can feel sorry for themselves and vilify america for the nato bombings of 1999. they do this by perpetuating lies about serbs being our allies during wwii, claiming the whole world is unjustly against them, and completely ignoring everything said and done by slobodan milosevic, like waging war on three neighboring countries. they seem intent on making a political film but only show a few seconds of milosevic on a tv screen with no sound. a nationalist agenda obviously superseded any consideration of art which was not the case with lepa sela.regrettably, i recommended this film to a teacher when it played last week at the seattle international film festival. he also cited the bad editing and confusing plot, and i had to apologize for the bad advice. you've been warned.

there's only 2 reasons i watch this show...i invested the time already in previous episodes and col tigh. for all you supposed sci-fi fans out there who love the new bsg, give me a break! go read some classic sci-fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and tv shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these bsg writers are. their only gimmick is "who is the fifth cylon". poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development. if adama resigns or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father he should have been one more time...ahhhhh! and roslin is as annoying a character that's ever been put aboard a starship. out the airlock with her. i could care less if it's six more months before they conclude. these wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one. if you don't know that, you just don't know writing.

i really enjoyed bg seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. but i can't defend this nonsense. spoilers follow.the first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: so if starbuck thinks she knows where earth is why not send her out in a raptor? would the admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? would the quorum elect their newest member, the non-elected adama junior? he has about three weeks political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust. would adama send gaeta and halo along with starbuck leaving himself short of senior officers? would adama put a man into having sex with cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet?i just don't buy any of this.secondly, while i accept there have been miracles and references to god up to the end of season 3, it's now all totally over the top. i started watching bg because i thought it was sci fi, not some biblical epic. i expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently, and wanted some satisfying explanations regarding some of the odder developments in the series. baltar was the best character in the show, but he now seems to be totally insane. not illogical considering what he's been through, but very unsatisfying.all the characters appear to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third party's behest (some godlike entity). this isn't good drama, it's annoying and a writing cop out. ok, so what are the good points? nice battle at the start of 4.1. some good dramatic scenes (well acted) when viewed in isolation. a good final scene, a nice cliffhanging curve ball of a development.but this isn't sci fi, it's turned into fantasy. i can't imagine how the writers can recover this one.

the plot outline of this movie is similar to the original. someone gets kidnapped, the prince is incest with saving her, odet turns into a swan, the turtle/frog/puffin first the "bad" magician as best they can, and in the end.... anyways, there is not much new here. with the exception of a lack of well known voice talent. sorry, no palance nor cleese and thus jean-bob was a disapointment.

the worst sequel i've ever seen. really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is! also, which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no john cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful. it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again. but to be fair uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny. but the fact it was her 50th birthday: why do they draw her looking like an 80 year old? i was going to give this a 1 but now i think... i might give it a 2. but still the story line is no where near as good as the first film . it is similar without the humour from certain characters. overall i disliked this film entirely because of the disappointing music, the severe lack of voice talent: having changed the voice of prince derek and jean bob, the new villains, disappointing storyline the annoying habits of some characters, and the very simple animation.

i was disappointed with the sequel to the swan princess. i can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how married life was going for odette and derek but the story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the original.it isn't funny. the only bit i found humorous was when jean-bob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and no-one saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really did.the villain is rubbish and the animation isn't as impressive as the first film.the queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with derek to rescue his mother, you're hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talking.it is a shame because i really liked the first movie but it didn't live up to my expectations.

when i was a little girl, i absolutely adored the swan princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of snow white, sleeping beauty, and cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. but i figured that i would check out the sequels for the swan princess to see what they were like and unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. the only character i found still very amusing was the queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. but with the voice changes, they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit, i don't mean to be picky, just it was too weird for me. the story also was just more or less borrowed from the first swan princess, just the villain in this movie is following rothbart's footsteps.odette and derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary, but derek has been too preoccupied with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe. with his mother's birthday also coming up, he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town, clavious, who is hoping to go above and beyond where rothbart's powers went and kidnaps the queen on her birthday. but odette must change back into her swan self in order to help derek fight him and save his mother.the swan princess 2 is of course more than alright for the kids, that i never mind, it's good clean fun for them. the reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids, that is the audience they aim for, but it's more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone. now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there, but this wasn't as clever in my opinion to the first swan princess. i would recommend it for the little one's, but if you're looking for a fun cartoon movie, i'd recommend staying with the first swan princess.4/10

mickey rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the ira and goes on the run in london !!!! mild spoilers !!!!the movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in northern ireland which gives a prayer for the dying a stark realism . however as soon as fallon decides he's going to give up violence ( what ? he's a terrorist and he's never blown up innocent passerbys before ? ) realism disappears and clichés and ridiculous plot twists take place . martin is employed by the london underworld ( don't they have their own hit men ? )to commit a hit while he wears an ira " uniform " ( never knew the provos wore uniforms ) at a cemetery in broad daylight ( wouldn't an ira man use a bomb placed under a car ? ) where he's spotted by a priest who recognises him while he was in the sas . hands up who thinks i'm lying ? i'm not and we're half way through the running time and there's still several clichés to come this all sounds very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by jack higgins ? everything is clichéd , contrived and stereotypical and the bits that aren't are just plain bizarre . the critics slaughtered this movie when it came out , most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had bob hoskins playing gangster jack meehan and alan bates playing the sas soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right . they should also noted the film might have been less dire if fallon was played by someone who was capable of doing an irish accent . rourke might be hunky and macho ( oh gawd another movie with an ira uberhunk ) but accents aren't his strong point any more than character acting is . to give you an idea how disappointing prayer for the dying is the director ended up disowning it which is always a bad sign as a footnote the original release of prayer for the dying in britain was delayed for several months because of " the enniskillen bombing " . in november 1987 the provisional ira exploded a bomb in the centre of enniskillen where a remembrance day parade which commemorates britain's war dead was being held . eleven ( 11 ) people were killed and scores more injured . it wasn't an accident and no one left the ira because of it

mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome. you know what you are going to get with rourke - mean, moody, dirty. but this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.first and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees ireland for london. he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades. he has also vowed to never kill again. it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.however, when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster (bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for £50,000 and a boat trip to the us. rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. he figures it is better than killing him.a wealth of things arise here which just don't add up : 1. why pick rourke to off your competition? as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing. 2. not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke? 3. hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection, i may add - to take confession? no way. 4. rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. why aren't the cops checking the place out? 5. rourke hangs around the church and hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterwards without anybody bothering him. what? he's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? stupid. 6. the cops actually meet rourke in the church "fixing" the organ and have no idea who he is. do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? they don't even check up on him? 7. why get rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? you'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. or kill him. one or the other? 8. why does bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? could he not restrain himself for a few days? at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states? ridiculous. 9. rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? again - utterly ludicrous. and besides - she falls in "love" with him in record time - a few days !!!! 10. the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view. 11. things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and i say that in jest) along. bates' houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl. 12. rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. it was embarrassing - the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked. 13. hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.i'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning rourke's hair (so falsely red it is laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes, walk, looks to the heavens etc. nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style.oooppps - i have just mentioned them.overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.4/10.

jack higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden ira bomber forced into "one last job" (where have i heard that plot before?) gets a snarky treatment from cult director mike hodges. mickey rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses all to the priest (bob hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. the rules of the church keep father bob from talking, but then rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. they bond at the church organ. what? really, that's the plot. alan bates is around as the top dog mobster who's calling the shots (literally) and he seems to be the only actor who's on to the jokey tone hodges is aiming at. bates is all set to do a sort of u.k. prizzi's honor, but no one else, including an effortlessly charismatic liam neeson in a supporting role, has been informed.

let's get things straight. i was raised catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. that was useful for two things: to make a convinced atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas. and i say: if a catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he can report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards. he can not reveal what he's told in confession, but he can talk about anything he sees outside that, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. so, here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie. and another lie is there's no absolution for murder. according to the catholic church, there's absolution for any sin as long as there's sincere repentance. so far, the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller.as people frequently say, this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles. hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters (i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niro's weakest performances in "the untouchables") and bates' features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past. but above that, i think the film would have been much better had real-life ulster native liam neeson (back then mostly unknown to big audiences) played mickey rourke's part. not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters, but he'd make us believe the character as real, something rourke just can't. back in the 80s, rourke was not a bad actor (afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks), but he was one of those performers, like brad dourif, who's as good as the director he works with. and as a former ira terrorist, rourke's acting comes across more like a pimp. sad to think that, had this movie been made just some three to six years later (when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimi's enjoyable "darkman", and superstardom in 1993 with "schindler's list", while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has-been), liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit (rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of docherty, but just can't carry this movie along as the lead). yet another missed opportunity, and yet another film with the potential of being a classic, that became instantly forgettable fare.ironically enough, the often criticized score (by underrated composer bill conti) worked for me. i didn't find it overly-melodramatic, but suitably gritty and beautiful. it reminded me of howard shore's score for "the silence of the lambs". here's to mike hodges' talent, who made "get carter", yes, but don't forget he's the mastermind behind "flash gordon" as well...it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room (it shows, as some parts are really choppy and confusing, and others just don't glue) and a director's cut is waiting to see the light. ok, but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie, as we'll still have the bad casting and the false premise there. 4/10.

oh my god! after having such a promising start, critters 2 reiterated the karmic rule of what goes around comes around. clearly, very few things were thought out when this movie was made, and what was up with scott grimes wearing an earing! this should have been the last expedition into the critters saga, but more garbage was on its way. this was the big reason why i didn't watch critters 3, and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space? (critters, friday the 13th, leprechaun in space, hellraiser, etc.)

some changes for the better (the special effects are more elaborate), some for the worse (scott grimes, a likable kid in the original, has turned into an awkward teenager), but generally this sequel is about on a par with the original - which doesn't say much. the pg-13 rating is questionable; although the film is not scary at all, there is some brief but quite explicit gore, and some out-of-place nudity. (*1/2)

what a terrible sequel. the reason i give this film two stars instead of zero because it's a movie that has violence and gore and critters, yet it is planned out poorly. and this god-awful sequel was done by none other than bum-bum-bum-bum!!!!!!!!! mick garris! the bonehead that brought you the remake of the shining which nearly got kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made. garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of the fly, the fly, which was a wonderful movie, but garris's movie nearly ruined john getz career. anyway, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order, don't. that's the mistake i made, rent the first one or the third one or better yet don't stoop to that level at all! this movie sucked so bad that i can't believe it, please avoid this crap. shame on you, mick!

two years after leaving the small town of grover's bend due to encountering the krites, brad brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for easter. meanwhile the krite eggs begin to hatch. as they cause trouble in the town, brown & the townsfolk, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town.the original critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick "gremlins". it became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel. this sequel plays down the horror & makes its entire focus comedy instead. unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy, as well as childish. the acting is on par with the rest of the film. it is just that the film suffers from a weak script. the visual effects are fairly well done.grade: d+ review by m. k. geist.

1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (dir-mark dindal): fast-paced, frantic animation effort by ted turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. i'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to disney efforts like aladdin and lion king. don't let this fool you -- there is no comparison in story or quality.

this movie didn't do it for me, an avid snl fan for the past 14 years. jamie gertz' portrayal was ok, but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. the facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. but merv griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. he was never on snl, nor had anything to do with it. the points in her life when she was on snl are backwards. when we first see her on snl, walking through the studio with lorne michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989, not 1975. and let's talk about the cast -- who are these people?? i have never heard of a one of them. truly dissatisfying. this movie shows why tv movies are just that, tv movies.

i enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'nana (1926),' this jean renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. in the year 2028, following a great war, africa has become the most civilised region on earth, and what was formerly europe has been designated "terres inconnues (unknown land)." an african explorer  played by johnny huggins, a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man, if you follow me  travels to the ruins of paris in his spherical aircraft, and lands outside the lair of a parisian savage (catherine hessling, then the director's wife) and her primate companion, perhaps the creepiest ape-man costume i've ever seen. the savage, as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual, starts showing the explorer the charleston dance, which he is delighted to learn himself.it doesn't help the film that hessling, who was wonderful the following year in renoir's 'the little match girl (1928),' isn't much of a dancer, though the extensive use of slow-motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. furthermore, i'm quite shocked that renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object  it doesn't come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later! on the plus side, i did like the general sci-fi concept behind the film, and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this. however, why renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time. silly, crude and quite pointless, 'charleston parade (1927)' is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema's most respected directors, and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget. the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack, but i compromised with a selection of pieces from dmitri shostakovich.

made with film stock left over from the production of nana, 1927's sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and that's the best way to view it. jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together. the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston (naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'white aborigine' music). there are plenty of surreal touches, be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hessling's hair, the angels the girl telephones (renoir and producer pierre braunberger among them) or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while hessling's dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent, and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion, but there's not really enough to sustain it for two reels. an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions gate's new dvd

a man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. he hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to charleston. then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. i think that's the plot, but i'm not sure by a long shot. you can't tell that this is renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. good use of slow-motion, though. can be found on the ny film annex's series of experimental film videos, no. 18, i believe.

our story: two u.s. navy deep sea divers search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the filipino coast. our proof: extremely dull entertainment at its best, with no plot in sight. jim brown is completely wasted, provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey. richard jaeckel is in his usual form. don cornelius and richard pryor are among those who gave special thanks in their contributions! bombs away!!!

hmmm, not a patch on the original from shaw brothers. the fighting is average and looks very clunky. the story line is as to be expected from a 70's kung fu film, confusing and daft. stupid voices for women,dubbed in posh english accents for men. i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks. get the original, its so much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the shaw brothers movie. i have just started commenting, i'm only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection, i personally own most modern martial arts flicks. hope you don't waste time watching this one, its for die hard fans of 70's kung fu only.

ok, this movie wasn't good at all. video games aren't what i would brag on if i was over the age of 15. cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. i use my cell phone, i hope i don't loose my girlfriend in that. grease being the worst ever? ok, grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical. even if you don't like musicals, anyone would say grease is good. my brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so awful. i feel asleep.

well, the first thing i saw after looking at the dvd box was "best screenplay" and thought this would be a good rental. wow, was i mistaken! i'm sure at one time there was a good movie in here, but after the incredibly poor acting and "video game" production values, this ends up looking like tron's retarded half-brother. the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. five minutes into it, you'll be asking yourself, "what the hell am i watching?", and it will just snowball from there. an awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like rob zombie's "dragula" rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie. on a side note, #3 most romantic quote in a movie - "i think you're the final destination."

why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a simpson's halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice. but overall i would avoid this film at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing. the best bit? its only about an hour and a half, thank god.

i realize why people hate this film. and, i hated blair witch project,so go figure? this is about as staged as it gets & yes they do insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem real.i really liked the madame lalaurie storyline though it's more than likely made up. but, the main reason i like this film, is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking & kidnapping them,i get chill-bumps every time & have to look behind me as it feels like something's there with me.i know it's my imagination, but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in today's cinemas & dvd's doesn't give me goosebumps,so that makes this a creepy delight.not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it & not for gorehounds as with a pg-13 rating there is no gore. and, the females are very annoying!you'll wish the ghosts would take them off & experiment on them before it's all said & done. ** out of *****.

catherine zeta-jones and aaron eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about an uptight chef played by zeta-jones, who ends up carrying for her niece when her sister is killed in a car crash. while she's out taking care of family matters she's replaced by eckhart.unfunny maudlin tale with no chemistry between the leads (she's a dead fish and he's okay, but not much of anything). watching this i was wondering why anyone would want to see this since zeta-jones' character is so unlikable. come on she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food. ugh. i won't use any of the numerous puns that come to mind. i couldn't finish it.

i recall years back, michael douglas wanted his wife, catherine zeta-jones, to be in a romantic film because he felt his wife had all the goods. no doubt she does, but not in this film. a colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. this was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be, boring and a huge disappointment. didn't even watch the whole film, torture. catherine zeta-jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen, move around, present a dish but this wasn't the food network, nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest brewing, where was the chemistry. the poor slob on the second floor of her building trying all the ploys to connect and no character development there. the loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness. the sister's daughter just was plopped here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in, not. just a waste of movie time. the promoters certainly did their job to put this lack-luster film on all the networks tempting you with all kinds of teasers. sorry to say, don't spend a dime.

yes, i spelled that right. this movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. the foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.catherine zeta-jones and aaron eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably. it's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few. sure, it's an ok movie if you have nothing to watch, but you won't miss anything by missing this one.

i hesitated seeing this movie, having really enjoyed the original, 'mostly martha'. what a disappointment. catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film. the original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. no reservations felt like it never connected. the food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. in mostly martha, the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. the food in 'no reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it. it was hard finishing the movie - many of the scenes felt awkward. see the original - it's a truly enjoyable movie; the soundtrack incredible.

i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (bella martha/mostly martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. i miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. i don't think that the story itself is enough. martha/kate is more secluded, and mario/nick is not a clown. in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here. the small alterations take away the tension. my opinion is that you should go and see the original. it'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles.

there really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef kate armstrong (catherine zeta jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece zoe (abigail breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. and that reason is to watch aaron eckhart (nick) who, with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes. he reminds me of sean bean. the thought that he might take his shirt off really was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. he removed his apron petulantly several times, but to my disappointment, never went further.i can't be too critical because i was watching it on pay per view at home, so it hadn't cost me the price of two movie tickets at least, and i was brought up to be grateful for small mercies. but really, this is rom com at its most formulaic. zeta jones gives a very flat, monotonous performance, she seemed utterly lacking in passion, (possibly due to the amount of time she apparently spent in the cold store at the restaurant? thirty takes in there can't have been fun) and her face barely changed expression throughout the whole movie. abigail breslin was pretty good as the niece, she's such an appealing little girl that it's quite impossible to criticize her, and anyway i loved her in little miss sunshine. patricia clarkson is always good value and i can't really fault her performance as the restaurant owner, because she seemed very underused, given what a good actor she is and how little she had to do here. but the whole thing is just so clichéd, much of the dialog banal, and the outcome so obvious. this is the cinematic equivalent of paint by numbers, and zeta jones and eckhart generate little heat on screen.nick likes italian food (doubtless indicating his burning inner passion) and cooks to the sound of puccini. his appearance in kate's kitchen at 22 bleecker (the restaurant's name) predictably ruffles her feathers but his uncanny ability to bond with her niece by cooking pizza and building a bedouin tent in the living room, brings kate around and, despite a few stumbles along the way, she ends up giving him her prized possession. no, not her honour. but her recipe for saffron sauce.i'm being very unfair here, aren't i? i mean rom com is rom com, and we all know what we are letting ourselves in for when we sign up. but does it always have to be so mind numbingly dull?

how bad idea was to remake an almost oscar -worthy film?! mosthly martha is much more better, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (martina gedeck). it's a joke and ugliness with the handsome aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from hollywood. there are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script? or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures? the films are getting much less interesting nowadays. oh yes: if you want to see a really good movie watch the original one. it's definitely worth.

there is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. how "mostly martha" was remade is awful. the title of the movie is awful. the actors are awful. and the idea of combining good cooking and usa is awful. if you have seen "bella martha", well that is the original title and it means "beautiful martha", this one is a punch in the stomach. the acting of ms.jones is so poor and unnatural that even jessica alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomactr.asp) would have done better. not to mention the cook, who would better play a different role. and the little girl... not worth mentioning. bella martha was a very nice movie, an authentic one... why was it remade? there was a story.... here they took it out. there is no story... what shall it represent? in one way also this movie was perfect. you know when all ingredients fit together? well this is the case here. a perfect crap....

much as i really like catherine zeta-jones, i wondered once again, why remake a good movie? this version lacked the tension and passion of mostly martha. it was a clear rip off. maxime foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. i couldn't believe abigail breslin. martina gedeck owned this role. unfortunately zeta-jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). sergio castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful italian. aaron eckhart seemed passionless in comparison. this version was pleasant but bland.the love between mario and martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. the therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important. i liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned. i have mostly martha at home. every now and then i revisit it.

go to the video store and get the original. i do not understand why hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it. "mostly martha" or "bella martha" has a much better cast. beginning with the heroine martina gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous catherine zeta jones, to the italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, not fit for child-rearing. in many ways, the american version of the movie is a copy of the german original. they just exchanged the actors. however, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very believable to materialize a father for the little girl in an american context. i was thinking about that. maybe the father could have been puerto rican, or cuban, or mexican. well, there are so many "guest workers" in the u.s. take your pick. but i doubt that any of them would have shown up to shoulder the responsibility as the italian father did in the original. therefore, the american movie leaves that part out but keeps the italian cook. and by doing this the whole story changes. in the original "martha" is so removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece off with a complete stranger in a foreign country. the american "martha" is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have that edge the german movie has. in the original the "italian" cook is not so good looking but much more charming , the little girl is more of a brat but much more believable and "martha" is more representative of a career woman in today's world than the watered down version we are presented in the american version. and the whole opera music in the american version was very annoying. i loved the italian songs in the original and bought the cd. hollywood recognized that "mostly martha" was a great movie. maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in english without subtitles. in any case, the original is so much better. by the way this reminds me of another remake. "shall we dance" is one of my favorites in the original japanese version and totally forgettable in the american version.

well, i must admit, when i saw the trailer for this movie, i was looking forward to it. i am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer, thats the impression i got of this movie. however, i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. although there were a couple of amusing scenes, in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing.i also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of opera, making the movie feel dragged out and slow.all in all, although there are some touching scenes, the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy.not fantastic, and as i have said before; bland.

this movie had all the potential and makings of a great feel good, great love story...the cast is perfect, the visuals work, the original premise works, the characters work....but the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable way...not one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director. all we know about catherine zeta-jones character is she is obsessed with her world....nobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her world...that much is obvious....but the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are really never explored or exposed....aaron eckhart's character had so much more to offer to the story but wasn't allowed, abigail breslin's character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across somewhat predictable and phony....in the end everything reverts back to the forced turbulent world of catherine zeta-jones which the audience never totally falls for....honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish, self obsessed, spoiled lady who most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world. the director needed to make her a hero and never does....in the end, it is eckhart's character that ultimately wins because he wins.not a lousy movie, just a movie that could have been a lot better with more depth of personalities allowed in, explained and exposed.cheers

this is the ultimate kung fu movie! this is the only kung fu movie! this is the only kung fu movie i have ever seen! i am giving this movie way too much credit! my best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it, so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn't watch it.this movie's story line was onion skin thin. that acting was goofy and stereotypical of any kung fu movie. the dubbing was literally the worst i have ever heard. it seemed if you played a small role in this movie, like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net, it didn't matter who over did your voice. it could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and nobody would have said anything. but beside all of this, the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenes.the fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about. but the instigations of the fights were totally absurd! on most all instances, a guy either pops out of the tall grass, or glances at the main character from a distance, and then attacks him. but once the fighting started, things sort of balanced out. there were only two things that really hampered the fighting, though. those constant "wooshing" sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword, and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fighting very jumpy and choppy. someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked, and then instantly be back on their feet blocking a punch. but while the cut and paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else, it didn't really affect the overall movie.in the end, this was not a great movie, but i wasn't expecting a great movie. a great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie's. all i saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom. i rarely say that, but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for, so you watch it whenever you have some free time. enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! good day gentlemen.-scott-

i have a friend that works at blockbuster, and he gets 5 free movie rentals a week, so one day as we were scouring the aisles for something interesting, i stumbled across 18 weapons of kung fu, and judging by the box alone, this movie seemed pretty wack, but nonetheless we gave into temptation and rented it -- afterall, it was free.....and thank god it was....this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen....the budget must have been a pickle and a piece of string...the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the "18 weapons" is that there is some book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons that some bad guy is after -- and thats it! there isnt even any weapon fighting in this movie...that and the action sequences are just flat-out bad....9 times out of 10 the other guy's punches and kicks come about a foot away from landing on the other guy's, and there are many times when the the movie will skip frames (a result of ridiculously poor editing)....the dubbing is as well laughable, and it is hardly even understandable....and we wont even get into the acting...the ending will definitely leave you saying "wtf??", however to be fair i must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent, and the old guy is a mad chump....but thats about it...thankfully i didnt have to pay for this movie, but i guess at least now i know exactly how bad a movie can actually be....

firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of kung fu starring gordon liu. i mention this as my kung fu theater presents dvd has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention (no idea why) the young hero starring hwang jang lee. apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style. the hero is lee shao hwa who i have never heard of before or any of the other actors. the film mentions another director wu yuen ling as well as the one imdb lists. the other actors are wang fu quen, wang wing san, chen fei fei, wang ki san, suen king kai and hwa yue suen who seem to have sunk without trace after this film. the fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the 'star' doesn't have much charisma. the twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it. the scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual. unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very irritating (though acrobatic) young boy.

this is an excellent example of an entreatingly bad b-movie. there are worse movies than this one (titanic for example), but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap movies.ok this was apparently shot in kansas city, which explains why everyone is so lame. the main guy looks like steve guttenberg, and is even more lame than him! i didn't even think that was possible! in fact, him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the worst drama ever! its not just that there acting was waaaaaaaaay over-dramatic, well actually it was, of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly one-two punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama.the scarecrow, lets talk about him. the whistling you hear every time he's around is stupid, and obviously dubbed in. now his costume, i cannot get over that - its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask! i simply am dumbfounded, maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage you'd be scared of him/it.one of the characters, the token black guy actually, used the line: "this might be a chance to earn my red wings" when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period. wow, um yea, that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to.oh, in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn, why is it roped off? i'm pretty sure its not supposed to be evident, just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this 'film' another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yup thats right), there all at the beach, and the one dorkaziod gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and its so obviously dubbed its funny. thankfully, the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guy's chest when he's done singing. overall the gore like that is pretty good, this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer.ok, there's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand, then stand up, whip out their peni, and urinate all over the guy in the sand. who does this? really, imagine it "hey, lets bury joe in the sand, then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him" in fact, this brings up the homo-eroticism in this film, what the hell? a good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing. what the hell is with that? traditionally, in film and real life, jocks get the girls and nerds don't. that really doesn't make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex, and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear, i don't get it.lets get to the sex. as someone who watched this movie with me put it: "i've never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life" and its true. if you like hot a cup action, or ugly old woman boobs, then this film is for you. i swear, they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene?? then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times, and man, i just didn't want to see that.now, i have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film, thats what really is just bizarre. it starts in the daytime, then they all head to the cornfield, and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night, when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach - its instantly day again, and apparently they stay at the beach until night again, and until day the next day. so basically these events in the film cover 4 days, without any of the characters needing sleep or anything, its really weird.after the main killings have taken place, it flash forwards to '3 weeks later' and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered! the surviving people literally pop some champaign! and thats when i realized the budget didn't go to the script, directing or acting, it all went to that freakin bottle of champaign.the ending. stop reading now if you don't want the ending spoiled for you, it truly is enjoyable.ok, so the end takes place in a church, and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body, then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy, and he fights him with a b-movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars! i'm not kidding, its so stupid! so somehow, in the middle of the fight, the scarecrow's soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr. guy, and then with the last amount of will he has of his own, he impales himself on a cross in the church! its awesome! some blood, but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! you can see the bottom move off the ground! wow, yea have fun watching.

this an extremely horrible movie. and if your thinking you've seen another horrible movie, exactly like this one before, you probably have. you probably saw scarecrow 2 made in 2003. yes thats what i said, brian (the director) stole the movie idea. and not only did he steal it, he actually might have been able to make it worse. i bet the even the actors were scared to tell people they were actually in the movie. also i have to mention that the director was trying to make up for the cheesiness by showing as much tits as possible. also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. in fact that is probably all that the director has ever seen, and tried to put together a decent movie, which will never work.

another sequel! why on earth do they keep making these? this has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever, yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels. scarecrow gone wild - which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series - brings back the evil straw-man who, again, butchers up some college kids... that's basically it. the acting sucks (as usual), the death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think. a couple nice topless girls, but nothing too pants tightening. let me just conclude my continuous insult (or review) on this movie by saying: if i come across a scarecrow in space or a freddy vs scarecrow on the video store shelves, i'm going to be in absolute awe...

scarecrow gone wild starts as high school teenager mike (david zelina) & his mates decide to to give a 'hazing' to wimpish diabetic sam (caleb roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. mike & his mate decide to take sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow & leave him there all night, sounds like fun right? well, things backfire when sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo & the vengeful spirit of sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life & starts to hunt down the kids responsible for sam's unfortunate life-threatening predicament. can sam's best mate jack (matthew linhardt) & his girlfriend beth (samantha aisling) save the day & sam's life?written & directed by brian katkin scarecrow gone wild is the third straight-to-video entry in the scarecrow series & while i haven't seen either of the previous two after seeing scarecrow gone wild i'm certainly in no hurry to change that situation that's for sure. the script actually has an almost decent premise as the wronged soul of sam seeks revenge & his friends have to keep the real sam alive somehow but the way it is told is poor & i suppose that basically it's just an irrelevance to the fact that this is a film about a killer scarecrow running around killing people in not very gory or imaginative ways. having said that there are one or two scenes here which save it from a one star rating, the fart gag in the corn field is funny & something a lot of immature blokes might do (like me), the bit when two guys bury their mate in the sand & then stand over him & pee on him is also rather funny in a laddish juvenile way & a cool bit when some guy starts singing an awful song so the scarecrow throws a pole which impales him! however these ok bits are few & far between & as a whole it's a silly, boring, poorly written teen slasher film with highly annoying character's who irritate. it' also very predictable & has a stupid twist ending which doesn't really feature the scarecrow at all which is a problem as when you watch a film called scarecrow gone wild you expect to see a scarecrow go wild & i have to admit he looks quite cool as horror character's go.director katkin does a reasonable job here actually although what on earth is up with that hospital at the end & all that neon lighting everywhere & the fact there is only one patient there & two members of staff? the cinematography is much better than the usual straight-to-video low budget horror film of late & there's some nice, if totally unrealistic, lighting. the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself. there's not much gore here, there's a couple of scenes where some actor has some fake guts placed on their stomach to represent them being gutted but it looks pretty fake, there's also a burned face & a couple of impalement's but little else. there's a fair amount of naked female breasts on show if that's your thing.technically scarecrow gone wild is pretty good considering some of the low budget abominations i've sat through recently, unfortunately it's still a poor film overall. the least said about the acting the better.scarecrow gone wild isn't as bad as some of the straight-to-video horror crap that's been turning up recently but having said that it's not that much better & it's still a bad film when all said & done. not recommended, the two previous entries are scarecrow (2002) & scarecrow slayer (2003) both of which also went straight-to-video.

1. the largest amount of money spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach, the ones that were supposed to be intestines. 2. ken shamrock is in it. 3. ken shamrock gets destroyed. (he doesn't die which is sad.) 4. it leaves you wanting more... aspirin. 5. the makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like. "just give him a $30 mask." "good enough for me." 6. the scarecrow runs a chick over. awesome. 7. the film-makers don't actually make their actors sing or play the guitar. 8. the scarecrow uses a volleyball pole as a javelin and impales the dude who doesn't actually play the guitar or sing. 9. the scarecrow can choke a dude in like 3 seconds. 10. it makes you actually think of all these things and write them down for other people. god what am i doing.

i watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't bag out that one, though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going. the effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie.i borrowed this one with an open mind, i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie.boy was i wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary, the storyline was so predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode, as i already would guess what will happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen.overall avoid this crappy movie.save some money.

i knew i was in for a long 90 minutes when the opening voice over mispronounced the word 'scarecrow' (it sounded like scare crew). and sure enough 90 minutes later, after witnessing beyond horrid acting, tedious drama, scarecrow's punches going nowhere near their intended target, but "hitting" it anyway, ken shamrock "acting", and the most stupid illogical ending, i've seen in my life (ok, no, i take that last one back, in about a week). after making it through all that, i openly weeped that i couldn't just go to lacuna a la jim carrey and just erase it completely from my mind. any thoughts i might have had that director brian katkin might have made an ok film given the right circumstances that i had after watching "slaughter studios", are totally and completely gone from my mind now.my grade: f eye candy: tara platt and lisa robert get topless where i saw it: starz on demand (available until september 22nd, 2005)

so me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the scarecrow series!?! keep in mind that this is not just scarecrow three; this is, scarecrow: gone wild. now both of us had seen to the first two scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job. let's start with the cover of the dvd first. first we notice a picture of ken shamrock ("the world's most dangerous man") on the cover. apparently he was used to market the movie as the "lead actor". by the way, he has the least screen time of any member of the credited class. next we notice a picture of a very attractive and very scantily clad woman in the middle ground of the cover. i can assure you that she is not in the movie....at all. at the time of rental we assumed that this was to reiterate the fact that the scarecrow was "going wild". in the background we noticed a large carnival on an island out in the ocean. i can also assure you that the carnival is also not in the movie...at all. looking back me and my friend should have known something was up. i mean really, who the heck puts a carnival on an island. now on to the actual movie. we start when a young man is inexplicably fused to a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field. don't ask me how they were fused but think of when brandon lee waking up from the dead in the crow. it's just that stupid. but in the scarecrow's defense, he has "gone wild". anyhoo, the scarecrow, who now lives vicariously through the young man, takes a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who had done him wrong. because yes, in the world of the scarecrow, beaches are conveniently located in the same general vicinity as cornfields. to make a long story short the scarecrow kills all who stand in his path without any warning except for the scarecrow's trademark whistle that signals a slashing. this is however rather impossible to believe because the scarecrow's costume's mouth is clearly sewn shut. several tracking shots that would make kubrick roll over in his grave later, and we have one of the worst third installments in a series ever. well except for maybe the third matrix. as joel siegel would say, "this scarecrow is wildly bad."

this third installment in the scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. i know, i know...but how good is it? well, let's not be silly. it's still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it's a fine film. again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. ****spoiler****when a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. in keeping with the legend, the boy's soul is transferred into the body of the scarecrow, which comes to life and wreaks terrible vengeance on, well, pretty much everyone. the co-eds drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the cornfield. on the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow. writer/director brian katkin does a credible job of bringing some much-needed drama to the film. unfortunately, the drama leaps over good and lands in common cheese. much of the acting was fair, but there were some really terrible bits, including an awful piece of poorly done lip-synching. some plot points were left mostly unresolved, and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered. again, better than the previous installments, but still lacking.

well first and for most i'd just like to say that i'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. only the movie in titled "scarecrow gone wild" could bring me back, so here i am.with that being said, i like to start off with this comment. ouch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this movie was really horrible, i mean i know it was going to be bad. but i had no idea that i would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what i thought was a horror movie.let's start with the biggest flaw of the film (to me that is). ken shamrock. now if memory serves me correctly, shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men. now if memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief (or that's how it looked to me). i mean how else do you explain all of his lines. my all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was "it's been a long time coming". ok????????? the funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed. so if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that it). like i said before, he must have been the comic relief, except i don't think his ufc buddies where laughing.now that i've finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie.i'll admit that i can't remember a lot of scenes, and that's not good considering that i just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago. so what i'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1. usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music, it's not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself. so why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling. i mean i saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.2. why on earth were there murders on a beach. i'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. but i guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. i mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.3. the girl running in the gray sweat pants. that really bother during the duration of this film. i mean she looks so ridiculous. plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. i mean what was she like twelve or something. there no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. i mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.4. people trying to get record deals on camera. just when i thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be gorth brooks and oh man was he lame. i don't' remember the whole scene, but from what i do remember it was not pretty. this one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and i mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. the funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. i mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the "token black guy". and that's sad because if i'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of american idoal. but here's where it gets funny. while this guy is all into his new song or whatever. in the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. and boy does he look pi**ed off at this. i mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. so what does he do about this jealousy, well i'm glad you ask. he wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. i don't want to give the death scene away, but i can tell you this. if that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.5. this movie was way longer then i expected. and it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. i mean i'll admit, i didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that i was hoping that the film was over and done with. but no they had to do they twist s**t. needless to say that when i say that coming, i just turned off the t.v. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. thanks to my rather fast judgment i can say that i'll never know what was to happen next. but i promise that i do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! all and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.

mary, mary, bloody mary is an ok time killer. it has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely dull. there are a lot of killings. and the production values are not bad. but in the end, it plays like a standard tv episode from the 1970s with some nudity thrown in. the film is the end product of an "author" trying to make a purely commercial film. there's very little depth here and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes. except for the scene on the beach with the old man, mmbm is almost devoid of any scares or suspense or dread. the director has very little understanding of the horror genre.it's watchable even though it doesn't leave a lasting impression.

some movies you watch and you say, "well, that made no sense." and you don't really mean it. you're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical."bread and circus" makes no sense at all. and i mean it. and that's not because it's surreal. from the start, it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. there's no script. there's no plot. there's no story of any kind. one event does not lead to the next -- that's how fundamental the bad writing is here.so what? i mean, there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category. they want to show you gore, they give you gore. why even talk about it?because, in this case, "bread and circus" gave me hope. okay, there are some surreal elements. vaginas, in the ground -- people crawling out of them. the earth, in space, two legs on either side. these sorts of images are wonderful, fun, odd, crazy. but the movie doesn't do anything with them.stuff happens, the movie ends, and it's all very unsatisfying. i suspect the script was made up on the fly. too bad. if there had been a story of any kind at all, it would have made for a much more entertaining film.the film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own. then you lift up the hood and there's no engine. just a small man peddling a bicycle.grr!

a chicago couple, dillon and dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. people begin to wonder if they did it. the police investigate and find suspicious evidence. the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press. the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. they are charged and brought to trial. they are represented by publicity-seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $100,000. the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented. their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home. dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed. verdict, she didn't do it but he did. he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years.in the last third of the movie, with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couple's defense. witnesses admit to having lied. other facts are brought to light that, finally, result in dillon's release. the killer is never found, though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp.this is a weeper from beginning to end. nothing seems to go right for the couple. oh, there are a few happy moment, maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy, or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another. but it's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (usually a fade to block follows.) there isn't necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies, although i can't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer. there's plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too. i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they're told. "oh, but i am fortune's fool!" romeo cries after killing juliet's brother. here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor, screaming, "where's my baby???" there isn't any ambiguity or irony in the story -- as i'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it's based. people are either good or bad here. or else they're bad, then they turn good.the film isn't aimed at exploring human quirkiness, or the way things work out. it's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience. the actors provide first-rate role models. i can't remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears. there are rivulets of tears. showers of them. cascades of them. a veritable niagara of them. a lake lacrymose of them.well, i'll give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted. dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator (ed asner). asner is sympathetic to them but he doesn't really accomplish much. he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy -- "learn to live with it," which is okay -- and because he suffers from colorectal cancer, so we can watch him take his medicine, double over with pain, and finally pass away.what's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple, it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises -- the function of gossip in regulating private lives.gossip is a strange thing really. if we call it "gossip" it's bad, but if we call it "public opinion" it sounds acceptable, at the very least. of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified. (as i write, michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy, and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile.) but gossip isn't all bad either. it's like water. when it's properly controlled it's a community asset. we need gossip to keep each other in line. it helps us to maintain public order. but, like water in a flood or a tsunami, it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control.this is a movie that's okay if you're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature. it's done so cleverly that, given its goal, it's hard to argue with it.

they prove that the cops, when they can't find the real perpetrators, always blame the parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their kids. these movies always depict the press as a bunch of animals and have the parents coming out of court to feed the press' hunger to humiliate the grief-stricken. hasn't anybody ever heard of a courthouse back door in these movies? here, you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found, but the police are not told and nobody heeds his findings.the police are portrayed as blockheads who don't know what they are doing and there's always an outside detective, like ed asner, who comes in late on the case, believes in the parents and solves the mystery.also, after the parents are cleared, they don't spit in the faces of the dumb cops who put them in jail, took their kid away and accused them of killing their own child.it looked as if i've see this film many times before.

the opening scene really got me into watching the movie. however, not more than 5 minutes later, i was already gouging my eyes out. not only could i not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. the one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. however, i didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two african americans. but i guess anything is possible. also, why the hell was robin in the movie? i'm not sure that it added anything artistically. overall, i would strongly recommend you jump off a cliff before you rent this movie.

"carlito's angels" is a spoof of "charlie's angels" that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times, however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well - it is amateurish and juvenile (i think "fast-motion" stopped being funny around 1914). the assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! the girls themselves are hot & adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even though they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination. by checking out their imdb pages, i found out that one of them (alessandra ramos) is actually going through with a film career; i wish her luck, because although this film is bad, she (as well as the other girls) gave it whatever energy it has and i wouldn't mind at all seeing her again on the screen. (*)

i thought that this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like friday. instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder. it wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad (many great films have been made on a low budget), it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp. case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope, put on their makeup, and then answer a phone call. you keep waiting for something to get story moving, but it never comes. the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying (which wasn't interesting anyways). if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it's bad, but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes. it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn't rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did. the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers.

this movie really shows its age. the print i saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints out there. however, this was not the major problem with the movie. the problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered (only a few sentences) in the film in the most amateur fashion. sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces--all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and "cleaverly" (?) hide the fact that the film was dubbed. well, its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious. it just looked cheap.overall, the film looked low budget and silly. it's really a shame though, because there was a grain of a good story--a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and/or has no interest in women. but in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. even with a few glimpses of the naked (and somewhat chunky) hedy lamarr, it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. even by 1933 standards, this film was a poorly made dud. about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america--she looks like 2 completely different people.it's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film, i don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews. for technical problems alone, the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it.

it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover. in a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve. it's probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story.hedy lamarr is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood. her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (aribert mog), the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.the swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. the love-making scene, later on, is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so. more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.not so. it's disappointing, primitively crude in its sound portions (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b. mayer saw the film and on the basis of it, gave her a career in hollywood. he must have seen something in her work that i didn't.it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. the jarring "workers" scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed. it fails to end the film on the proper note.

i saw this film when it first came out and hated it. i just saw it again 27 years later. i actually liked some of it... although robin williams was totally wrong for the role... what i remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what i had understood when i read the book. since i haven't re-read it, i can only give you my impressions from the past - but i am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life, whereas in the book, almost all traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are shown to be strait-jackets that we would be well rid of. the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children...something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures (with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air. too bad williams doesn't have a tenth of his charm!) my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book. as a film on its own it fares better - but only for a few key performances. mary beth hurt is wonderful - i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her. and john lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic... he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity. i watched him closely during all of his scenes, and never once was he anything except womanly. nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen... and that made all the difference. in fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one which is irreproachable. it is worth seeing this film only for his performance.

i went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. the only thing i enjoyed about it was when robin williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. glenn close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be garp's mother. a mother like garp's would have had her kids taken away by the department of children and families. robin williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me. he has two roles he can play: funny person or sad, tragic, good-hearted victim. see the fisher king, good morning vietnam, and all of his so-called "dramatic" roles. it is always the same performance. put them all together into one long mini-series. glenn close is always a cold fish. remember fatal attraction? would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? did you feel any sparks between her and michael douglas?? have you ever seen glenn close warm up any screen?? john lithgow had the only interesting role. this was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. garp is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and profound.

tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. i couldn't believe how bad this film was. i watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. was i watching the same film? the entire episode is one-dimensional. nothing that happened in garps' past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no-one was affected by their past. i think it was socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there. obviously, the director didn't know this rule and, so, stuffed his 'work' with one dire scene after another. even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected, it wasn't a surprise, but it was unexpected!it is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this (1st dec 2002), even though many people say it is one of their favourite films, no one has bothered to add a memorable quote. the reason being that there simply aren't any.don't waste your time watching this, watch a plank warp instead.

who the heck is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books? this is just terrible. terrible acting, terrible script. the story isn't even close to its old self - and what were they thinking? robin williams, for gosh's sake! this really defies description. don't see this. seriously, don't. not even for laughs. especially not if you're a fan of the book. this might just be the worst movie adaptation ever - everything is disjointed and scrambled - the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized, and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed (example: vienna - new york) into something profoundly uninteresting.for those who haven't read the book - it's basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up, exploring his writing and so on. his mother writes an autobiography which is hailed (despite her protests) as a sort of feminist manifesto. the book is well-written, engaging, and long. its prose is simply beautiful.this movie, on the other hand, is about robin williams once again telling us to seize the day.

empty shortening of john irving's novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd. it's a quirky, goofy and bittersweet string of sketches, attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother, jenny fields, played by glenn close.(the various stages of garp's childhood are played by three young actors before robin williams takes over as garp reaches adulthood.) the story follows him through childhood at a boys' prep school, where jenny is the school nurse, through his high school passions-wrestling,writing,and sex-to marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause. the plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. williams gives a cherub-faced performance. this script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted. he's like an injured bird sputtering out of control. john lithgow's role as a father like transsexual, imparting wisdom, also doesn't make sense. this movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of robin williams and his new entry into movies. williams had recently shed his mork and mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.

i was thrilled by the fresh (pun intended) synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it. the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place; the gardening allotments. the movie looks fantastic. colorful yet simple. magical yet genuine. unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go. we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative, sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by "nice victimized" refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people. the characters, particularly the prejudiced ones, are very "comic-booky" in nature. the story focuses mainly on two refugee families. one of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by diveen henry. i am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad acting.the other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers, where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most. benedict wong gives a mind-blowing performance here. at first, his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops, he subtly makes us aware of the inner-struggles of his character. unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just extremely boring. there were so many possibilities with this movie. there are several characters to keep track of, many of which might have potential but none of it is realized. even worse, despite this movie being very much not hollywoodian, some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood b-grade way. example:character a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem! let's have character c declare her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending. yawn. i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family. that was well done. unfortunately, the whole allotment business, the communal aspect of it, the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited.what you're left with is a movie that has very little worth.

i only gave this film a 4 because i saw it in 3-d. if you don't see it in 3-d, i give it a 2. this movie is so bad it's not funny. anyone can make a film like this for a weeks pay. bad acting,effects and story!!! but it was cool to watch in 3d. why can't they make good movies in the 3-d format???

83 minutes? nope, this thing is 72 minutes, tops.if you cannot guess the killer in this movie, you had better throw your tv out the window, because you ain't learned nothing in 20+ years of cinematic slasher history.and how come the plain star who never gets naked is always the one you want to get naked?

yeah i bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on this crap, i mean i didn't expect an amazing movie, judging by the front cover i wasn't really expecting anything great but at least not boobies in the first 3 seconds (i'm not complaining about the boobies..) i'm complaining about what the hell that has to do with anything? this film should have been kept on there hand cam at home as a joke....they suck..why was the blood more brown and turd like that real blood?...cheap i tells ya i mean everyone wasn't in colour they were just tinted yellow, and another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a film was the fact that they tried to pretend the clown was a woman all the time, although its clearly a flat chested black short haired man...did anyone else notice that the only special effect in this film was a slowed down jump..that was also poor oh and the dissolve effect that you can find on many basic p.c programs such as...powerpoint....this film blows

well, what can i say. what the f**k? there really isn't much to say about this, really. the only way you would like this is if u, like me, like bad bad horror to laugh at.acting- very unconvincing! just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! rip-off of texas chainsaw massacre! but in a bad way! just awful!gore- really not believable. in one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc. by using this,with the addition of red ketchup, its supposed 2 look real, although it really doesn't.plot- predictable 'kids get lost in woods on camping weekend' movie ripped off from friday the 13th.killer quality- scary mask if you're scared of clowns, kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however. the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror-camp movies out there.total- 3/10 */***** p.s- stay away from camp blood ii, that one made this look like lord of the rings.

but i can't say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung. where to begin. the film quality, there isn't any. i've seen clearer pictures on america's funniest home videos! the acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. the clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. the same thing over and over again. at least in a friday the 13th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part. there is no main characters, just victims. man, now we come to the worst part of all. the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends. then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room. what kind of ending do you call that, crap, that's what. in my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, that was just sloppy writing. the excuse, "it has to ending badly, it's a horror movie." or "we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel" are just lame excuses and that is all. i must give the camp blood the thanksgiving turkey.

yes sure, this is a friday the 13th rip off but i have no problem with it. it's a good effort, the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, jennifer ritchkoff. for a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. some people have problems with the use of the camera, i can't see what's wrong with that. it's so strange that so many people dislike this movie, i really enjoyed it. of course the script isn't original but give me one that is, i mean, so many slashers are made in the woods. maybe it is all predictable but it's a worth see, i have seen a lot worser, i can tell you that

how to round up every possible cliché and stereotype existing in the genre of horror and then subsequently stuff them into one massively lousy movie? the answer: "camp blood". this is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro-budget and a little bit too obvious inspired by "friday the 13th". four of the most intolerable teenage characters you'll ever see  they're like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying  go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit. don't even ask me what the killer's motivations were or even who he/she was, because if it did feature in the film, i totally missed it. this is one of the worst movies ever made, with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever. the production values were so pitiable that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable. the only half-decent and worthwhile sequence throughout the whole of "camp blood" is the opening in which the impressively voluptuous meredith o'brien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy scout. yes, i'm fully aware that this is a totally shallow remark to make, but then again this is a juvenile and retarded film, so who cares?

it's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.sure, it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by god, the production value is the lowest i've ever seen, the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment, everything is overlit, giving everything an amateurish look, bringing your thought to america's worst home video's or whatever that show was called..please people, is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this? you really should have done some short projects first cause it's obvious you're a bunch of amateurs! 1/10

camp blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. we're mixing friday the 13th with the blair witch project and adding....a killer in a clown mask.the budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original night of the living dead, which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor.this film was just so bad. there is nothing in the film even worth watching. the very fact i watched this all the way through stunned me. just take my advice and don't buy or rent this film. it is appalling.

1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(dir-brad sykes): ridiculously lame 3d movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks. stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site, become hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, is going to live. we really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies. what a waste of a 3d viewer despite somewhat decent 3d effects.

i must first mention that as a group of mates, we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value, hence our rental of camp blood.camp blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder, and was so rubbish it wans't even funny.the dvd was returned and a refund was demanded, with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked.don't do what i did, and let the curiosity get the better of you, it's so bad it's not even funny.

idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes camp blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, "camp bloody awful"), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. and it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... awful acting-check. bad script-check. tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. it doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted cliché imaginable. for example, the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods, so of course they end up dead. one of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels, how and why only baffles the mind. just stay away from this one.

camp blood looked great when i was buying it, but when i watched it boy was i wrong. its tacky, the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking. being a movie fan, i usually find humour from tragic horror, but at times i couldn't even laugh. maybe camp blood 2 will be an improvement.

i am a fan of slasher movies, especially of scream 1-3, but this one is just one killing after another. to my astonishment: part ii is far better and you get the whole story of part one summarized! so don't waste time on this one and move right on to part ii, you won't regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite self-ironical. first part: 1 out of 10 second part: 4 out of 10

i'm really amazed that this got an 88% on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars. the 7.3 rating on imdb... that's not so much of a surprise, seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently. i just can't get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted, and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. which, it turns out, actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of genghis khan. the far-fetched and over-dramatized mongol often echoes the likes of 300, a film that couldn't be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, mongol takes itself seriously. it's stoic seriousness, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies, is what makes it truly the most boring film i've seen this year; possibly the most action or biopic movie i've ever seen. the characters were pathetically written. honestly, i doubt genghis khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film. which is funny to me, because if there's anything that i'd think should be changed for the sake of theatricality, it's making a boring person into an interesting person. the romance between khan and borte is similarly boring, simple, and stupid. also, without giving anything away, mongol contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time- where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development, the film just skips forward without any explanation. it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing. (did i mention how seriously mongol takes itself?) meanwhile, it drags like no film i've ever seen before. even now, i could swear it was three hours long. about 45 minutes into it, i checked the time, being pretty certain that it was almost finished. besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from asano (naturally), mongol is honestly just a disaster. it completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me in anyway. i would never give this film a second chance. and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever, but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day. at least then i know what i'm getting, unlike with mongol, where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeing.the saddest thing about how much i hated mongol is that i have friends who i know, without a doubt, would simply love it.

the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months. the plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. the jokes where really poor. the narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about mongolian history, traditions etc. my co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost. i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all. it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end.

the narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story i think i've seen disguised in a slew of other films. i never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging, killing and double crossing his way to the top. the one redeeming quality was the photography- the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film, unfortunately combined with the bleakness of the story- i left unmoved, and disappointed..

i was waiting for this movie for a time. in the first day of the air in turkey, i watched it. it was totally a disappointment for me. i was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. first of all, the main character of the movie cengiz han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. you can not feel the power in the movie. historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years. to do that, cengiz first unite the asian tribes. however, in the movie, this loser man is in one scene poor-alone man, and in second scene, he is commanding armies. war scenes were incredibly week. in the final battle, the mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy. : ) as a consequences, me and my friends just laugh at that scenes. mongol army means mongol archery horseman. you can not see that in the movie. another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. i do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed cengiz as a prophet. we can say in the integrity of the movie, it is acceptable. however, the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of cengiz khan after cengiz gave him a mission is really funny. when the monk died in the desert, cengiz's wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent. we are talking about the asia again we laughed. there are a lot of more things to say but, i don't feel that this movie has value to talk more.

i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time i checked ghengis khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! awfully acted - i found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth! a saving grace of the film was the cinematography. that is why i gave this film a 2 star-rating rather than the bare minimum! however, if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead! all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money! please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss!

as a genghis khan "fan" i was looking forward to this movie. after devouring conn igguldens epic novels about genghis and reading up on loads of historic records i feel i know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...that turned out a deception. this movie is practically made up from beginning to end. there are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. that does not have to be a problem, i like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring. nothing of the greatness comes forth in this movie.i would not recommend this movie if you know anything on the subject.

have seen this movie today. very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist. the most sad things are:1. it's very slow. 2. how ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? 3. lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. we see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. click! - the very next second he's leading the huge army, without any reasons to be a leader. 4. the magic of ghengis-khan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf/god/whoever it was. 5. can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years? 6. is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies? does ridley scott know that way? 7. why after 20-30 years khan's mother doesn't look older? 8. what is the motivation for the main character? (none. literally.)don't waste your time. really. cinematographers's work is good; the nature is outstanding - but the movie cannot be made without director and script. the real ghengis-khan would execute director in a second.kind regards.

i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.we were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. two hours and six minutes long, it is. it's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.one would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. there's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. however the writers fluffed it completely. we get no real history. we get instead a hollywood version of history.what sustains young temudjin through his long -- almost endless, actually, or so they seem to the viewer -- tribulations? why, the love of a good woman, of course.how does he get out of prison? well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises temudjin's love for her, dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there, talisman in his hand. and of course she then goes and, having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful, rescues him.how does he escape from the shackles? well, he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf-god tengri (or some such name) and tengri sets him free by magic. yeah, right.why does he want to become ruler of the mongols? the wolf-god again, apparently. off goes temudjin to ask for guidance, and -- surprise! surprise! -- he gets it. "laws," he says to himself. "what the mongols need are laws. good, simple ones." golly, it was impressive.and then finally, how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? better tactics, certainly, but also through the aid of the good old wolf-god again, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. all the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (mongols are scared of thunder, you see) -- but not our temudjin. the troops, completely wowed by his bravery, acclaim him king! i don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. the funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk, dirt and violence. it's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.there's heaps of violence in graphic close-up: slashings, impalings, spouts of blood, sprays of blood, clouds of blood -- the blood guys had a great time, actually. despite the realism, it's impossible to take seriously.i must mention the ludicrous cgi final battle scene. how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. they don't. oh, and it's all shot in the standard hollywood style -- breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close-up stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. and the standard dolby super-sound-effects of whumps and thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain tension.tedious.avoid.

first of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of mongolian music. well, the horses looked mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was mongolian in it. oh, borte is played by a mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. but she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.but, i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by mr.bodrov. the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion. there was no logic behind the development of the plot. in fact, there was hardly any story at all, just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in "mongolian" clothes, speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian. most actors were either japanese, russian or chinese, most scenes were shot in china, kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a "mongolian". the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow. the battle scenes are laughable. all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story.the japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. he looked sleepy, soft, stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie.and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste. to see chinggis-khan half of the movie as a slave, to see his two first kids be born from other men, to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant... my blood starts to boil. and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha? one could make a great movie out of it. where is the story of the rise of temujin? of his childhood, of his relationship with his family, with his brothers, of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family? where is van khan, who helped him a lot? where is the depiction of life in the steppe, of the life of the nomads, of their traditions, of their relations with the other nations around them?where is development of the characters? we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important, how temujin became chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. all this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.

i'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. i do not connect with any of the characters. this is a problem for a documentary. that disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. although because of the poor story flow, i'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. the story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on. the 3rd founder that takes them for $700k is introduced so late into the film, khaleil and tom have to backpaddle (fruitlessly) to explain "oh yeah, this guy created the idea too". and just when i thought i had a slight grasp on who all the tertiary characters were, some crazy woman in ranting about getting a puppy? what's up with that? also, did tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the staff? i can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening. actually i think i feel for them.

i didn't care much for this, it seemed too contrived for a documentary. also, the filmmakers seemed to steer me towards certain characters, and yet i was completely unsympathetic towards the protagonist because of what they chose to show me of him.this movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting, yet the movie fell flat because of snappy editing that didn't allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene. the developments in the story were glossed over in lieu of showing the men in boxers or other stuff that was incidental to the tale that they were telling.i'd recommned that you skip this one and just read up on this story.

this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen. it looked so amateurish. chris hegedus was one of the directors of the war room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided), but it looked beautiful. startup.com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement. the quality was so pitiful that i couldn't stand watching it. i saw about 30 minutes or so and i had to take it back to blockbuster and get something else. i can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like chris hegedus. how the hell did this win any awards to begin with??? the war room definitely deserved an award, as did another great documentary called ameragosa (both won awards). this documentary looked like it was done by uncle joe who also does weddings on the weekends. shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, bad sound, a 10 year old could make a better film than that guy did.

the ten steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling. the dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in irish short films. really really embarrassingly bad. the girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. she telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. the mother, an "actress" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as dad is 'trying to impress his boss'. the actress playing the boss's wife very successfully emulates the mother's poor acting when she tells them that their house is haunted. the rest of the film consists of the father coaxing his daughter down the stairs on the telephone. the ten steps employs the stock techniques in camera movement, lighting and music that one would expect in a below average horror film. poor.

rko was trying to boost its starlet joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (john beal) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. tcm aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of joan fontaine.fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and john beal is okay as her love interest. but it's obvious that philip huston (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young james garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with fontaine. whatever happened to this handsome actor? why didn't rko promote him, along with fontaine? he showed skill as a light comedian.these are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as i watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title. the story itself is rather tiresome, only occasionally coming to life because of fontaine's spirited heroine.she photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully, suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date. beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. strictly lackluster.but whatever happened to philip huston? evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career.trivia note: watch for dwight frye (of "dracula") as the out of control patient aboard the airplane.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. if i wasn't watching it for free, i would have never finished it. the creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. it seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of scary movie and date movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed miserably. the only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. a guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. none of the ideas are clever, basically the worst premise for a movie ever. the plot (or lack thereof) is completely retarded. the plot seems to center around the coach and his family, however there are so many other things going on in the movie it is completely ridiculous. terrible, terrible movie.

back in 2002 when matthew lawrence did the hot chick, i also saw drumline that day. drumline wins by default! if the comebcaks had been released in march (as planned) the same time tmnt was released, tmnt would've won by default! granted, matthew lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback. he didn't have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus. but when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl's boob, those were the minuses.but the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video, except matthew lawrence (insert the price is right's losing horns)! another blown musical opportunity for him, just because he's shy about doing music.in the past, matt has disappointed me many times (super human samurai syber squad) where he came so close to having a musical moment, but ended up failing.sure, joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and andrew's starting a music career of his own. but it's very rare to find a matt musical moment. the two that stand out would be on brotherly love where he played the guitar and sang "pigeon on your car" (art atrack), which he wrote by the way, and that romantic boy meets world moment when he sang "this dame" (as time goes by).matt, you've played jocks too long. why not make a musical comeback. you have a good voice and i miss your musical side.

we arrived at the theater too late to see rendition, which was our intention, and 'the comebacks' was the only film that hadn't already started. i had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter. the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started.the screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports cliché at the audience without creating a single laugh, not one during the entire movie. think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned. if you add texas to the mix,you ought to come up with the sports version of 'little miss sunshine', not a big yawn.the first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was 'can't stop the music' by comparison, this was 'can't stop the music' without bruce jenner, valerie perrine, or the village people.if the film had a single grace note, it was seeing matthew lawrence grown up.

this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen. what a weak waste of michael imperioli's obvious talent. disgusting film from start to finish. all i can say is, this director is no 'auteur'. you never once get inside the game, the character's head, the amazing talent with numbers the real stuey had. the coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set, it might have been a great scene had it been shot for movies and not the stage, with the camera half way across the house hovering over a mirror with drugs on it while the drama is going on far in the background. the scene where he wins the big championship is just laugh out loud ridiculous. this should be screened in film-making 101 - what not to do in making pictures.

where do i begin with the killing mind before i mention the good bit? this movie is about a young psychological profiling fbi woman, or something, that for some reason goes to work for the lapd for a wee while. there are some recognisable faces, like the "i love you, man" bloke from wayne's world, playing a cop (nice beard-age too!) and two guys who always seem to play cops playing..... you guessed it, cops. one of them was one of the cops in gross point blank following john cusack about the place, and the other is the fbi guy with specs in final destination, who is also in the fugitive as another cop. i know the fbi, us marshalls, cia, etc aren't cops, but they're all the same. they enforce the law to a certain degree, that makes them cops in my book. feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop all you want, they're still seen as the ones who are trying to bring the bad guys down. any, i digress. the woman is working alongside these cops who just seem to sit around in a library in the basement or something, and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that hasn't been looked at for yonks. she saw the dead body as a kid, so naturally decided that she can reopen the case cos she was personally attached to it! i also like how the person profiling other people's psychological state witnessed a murder scene as a child. surely that's the kind of thing that can screw with someone's head?! she starts asking questions off some journalist who covered the story when it was open, even though he appears to be the same age as the woman, so he presumably was either writing for a newspaper when he was 10, or he wrote a few school reports on it, and she decided he'd be the best person to ask about it.we then see that as well as reopening homicide cases from 25 years earlier, she tries her hand at petty theft as some really inconspicuous bloke sprints through a busy street wearing a balaclava. way to blend, moron! anyway, she and the cops she's with eating ice creams in the park give chase after him, and whilst crossing a bridge with a woman and child standing on it, the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and throws the baby in the river. this, if you haven't already guessed, is the best bit of the movie. i'm not sadistic, and don't have a hatred for babies or anything, but the scene just looks so stupid i promise you will wet your pants laughing at it if you should watch this movie. it gets better when the cop from final destination & the fugitive jumps in to rescue the baby then declares to his friend "it's a baby!" how did he not know that before he jumped in, is beyond me.anyway, she chases after the thief but loses him. later on she remembers that a random dog didn't bark at the thief, so assumed it must be his and decided to track down the thief through the dog. the dog had no markings or anything on it, so how she knew where to find the dog, and thus find the thief is another question i won't go into. it was shortly after this that i stopped watching. the story was moving really slowly, and after i had stopped laughing at the baby throwing bit, i had kind of lost interest and missed what was being said.saying that, i'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit shifty, and she was spending a lot of time with him, and anyone who watches columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy. plus, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so i'm sure it was him.so all in all, a pants film, but worth watching just for that one glorious scene.

first of all, season 1 is intolerably bad. the prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two dimensional they're nearly transparent, and the direction is terrible. it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play, characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines, passing off as random prison talk. soon the show gets better, but not by much. the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair-bound augustus hill, who is played impressively by harold perrineau. the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues, most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's taking place in the show.unfortunately, the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes. consider the whole situation, first of all. prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk, doing drugs, and they not only have cd players (cds?? they might as well pass out steak knives), but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners. christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. guards that don't do much. near the end of season two, an older prisoner's grandson is diagnosed with leukemia, and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of $20 and $50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish. these have to be the richest prisoners in the world. every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring, loving guys except kenny wangler, an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing. even adibisi wanted to be nice. but that's okay, because there is no order or sense in the show, so even this is not much of a distraction.later, shockingly, there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an "i love cops" t- shirt. in prison!! can you imagine?? i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago. i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school, and in the picture, one of my friends was holding an "i love cops" bumper sticker, and one of "the woods" (guys who have been in prison for years and years) saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds. my cousin got lucky. kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks. one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class. you may lose track of who is in charge, the prisoners or the guards. more than one investigator, for example, goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade. personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators. let's see, what else? shillinger's son od's in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs. he just...got them, i guess. and make sure to pay attention, otherwise you'll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums. i didn't know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options. how about this, when robson asks about dr. faraj's schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given, faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot. do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners? after poet and o'reilly make the announcement to the entire prison, robson asks to see dr. faraj, and is escorted to his office, brought in without knocking, and the guard promptly leaves without a word. they might as well give him a gun.i shouldn't go on about stupid ideas in this show, but it's like a flood, i can't stop it. who thought of the chinese refugees who can't speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they're needed? who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners? who though of robson's gum transplant? what's the deal with busmalis and agamemnon? agamemnon because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson. macbeth, because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end, as it were. but what are the worst ideas? things that go nowhere, which are constant. an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb. he threatens to blow up the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a dud, and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated. nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again. it's like it never happened. in one episode, prisoners are given dogs to train. what the hell?? if that wasn't bad enough, during one training session, a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise. no one seems to mind.i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out, the culprits are pulled aside, they don't say anything, and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says, "i hope you don't think i'm gonna let this go!!" and then they walk away and let it go. the audience won't remember. maybe i'm spoiled by prison break, but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play. a short one. at least a low-budget movie. there is just not enough here to sustain a multi-season tv show. then again, i watched six seasons of it on dvd. sometimes i don't understand myself...

not for the first time, i'm out of kilter with the majority view. oz is a dreadful, pretentious, voyeuristic series. the makers have their cake and eat it. oz, em city, etc are used as ultra- crude signals that the apparent grittiness is complete fantasy. this allows viewers the feeblest of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense spiced with everything that is bad about human beings.when you watch an episode, please remember that while the foul-mouthed, violent, absurdly convoluted, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes, several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or water.oz is exploitative drama at its worst. it appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful. it blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a mahler symphony.dialogue is unrelentingly ugly and utilitarian. the liberties taken with realities are stupid. here's a nightclub owning dandy, arriving at oz in his foppish finery, complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in one eye, brandishing a stash of drugs that nobody detected. here's a murderous wimp bleating about the heat death of the universe, begging to be killed, but of course being refused by the brute he approaches and doing a bit of improbable throat cutting himself.the action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic, dim-witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown. don't worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will be along within a minute or two. finally, oz is obviously pretentious. you don't have to feel embarrassed about being carried along by its flow. you can watch it and tell yourself that the producers, writers and actors are doing everything with a huge wink (or same word but for a change of vowel) to the audience. yes, you can be a nasty-minded viewer and excuse yourself on the grounds of the cleverness, post-modernistic, etc skills of the oz production team. they appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane.truly, a despicable series. and every hour it shows, rewarding its makers and actors, and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary, another few hundred children die whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible, successful, widely-praised series.

because it came from hbo and based on the imdb rating, i watched the first season of this series, what a waste. the characters are occasionally interesting but mostly cartoon-like. the acting ranges from good to mediocre talent with a s t r o n g emphasis on the latter. not only prisoners, also viewers should leave all hope at the cell door that this story is believable, it's such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong testicular fortitude to keep watching. the violence, as with most of the developments in the story, is titillating and whatever morality is supposedly served up, it's of the lite variety. if your idea of excellent television includes the the writing, acting and overall production quality seen in the sopranos, deadwood or six feet under, avoid oz. if you want to see a disneyland for illiterate jerks, watch oz. stuff like this gives edgy a bad name.

when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one. now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd ( they had not viewed it on the silver screen ), my opinion remains the same. the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak.

people, please don't bother to watch this movie! this movie is bad! it's totally waste of time. i don't see any point here. it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor. i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again.

an updated version of a theme which has been done before. while that in and of itself is not bad, this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other "inherent and pure" evil ones do. predictable, ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark. not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending.

this is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who guilty is. the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. the result is like every single episode of "columbo" or "murder she wrote". the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock! this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. skip this one, you are not missing anything.

this adaption contains two parts: 1. the "now" time, when gulliver is at home in england and soon is put into a mental asylum by the evil dr. bates 2. the "described" time, in which gulliver describes his travels.the times are interspersed with a very choppy tempo, which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have discarded that part, and followed the book as written. in the book, there is no dr. bates, no asylum, and mrs gulliver gets very little mention. the travels - in plural - are depicted as one in the movie. there are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there, look at them if you want that stuff. the "now" time part adds absolutely nothing to the story's value, is a complete invention by the movie adapters, and takes valuable time from the real story. all the time when this was going on i was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shown.so much for the drawbacks. the parts which actually are part of the real story are well done, and the cgi is really well done for its time. many small (and a few medium-sized) parts of the real travels are simply cut out, but that does not make the story halt. this is afaik the only version which depicts all four travels, and for that the movie should get special mention. the two interspersed parts get approximately equal time. i rate the first part 0 out of 10, and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. averaging out, i give it a 4/10. if only they would have cut the rubbish and focused 99% on the actual travels, since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels. why some adapter think that he is gifted enough to improve upon swift's work, i do not know. my best guess is that cgi was so costly back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets, gci, etc. in order to keep total costs under some limit, while at the same time producing a mini-series which clocked in at some set number of minutes.

george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit-com man about the house . though i haven't seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish fourmile family , a sort of love thy neighbour without the cynical racist gags .having seen this " big screen version of the show " i find myself asking what it's a big screen version of ? certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name . for some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like: " did he give it to you " " no that's the first time a man has resisted my charms " " i meant the envelope " you do get the impression that screenwriter dick sharples ( who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com ) has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films . in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it

g&m started a the odd couple downstairs in man about the house and went on to amusing the nation in their own sitcom.what was the typical small-scale personal charm of the couples chemistry on the small screen, g&m's transferral to the big screen was as appalling as genuis's morcombe and wise, and countless fine tv shows.unfunny. unsatisfying and featuring an ill yootha joyce who died before the film was released.

such a highly-anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take. very, very hard to swallow...all of it. it didn't have an ounce of believability anywhere. and when you don't have a rose, you don't have a show.bette midler seemed born to play this part. yet, all she was able to produce was a cute, funny, glitzy, trademark bette midler...weighed down with all the familiar midlerisms. roz russell has nothing to worry about. she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose (of film, anyway).i thought midler was really going to put it across this time...to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time...like she did in "the rose." but, no, she played it safe. she played herself. she made rose a total dinner-theatre cartoon. even her songs were uninspired. it was maddening to watch, knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money-making schtick. she showed promise only once in this "gypsy" and that was with "rose's turn." but, by then it was too little, too late.a sincere cynthia gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose, you know there's trouble in river city.a huge, huge letdown.

what a truly moronic movie, all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and lsd because this must be the result of one of his 'trips'.you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey i'm sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this... only to be disappointed to find erm no there's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing. at the end of the movie you'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you, that'll be 11.95 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason. there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way. don't get me wrong i like weird movies, 'the cell' could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie (despite casting j-lo who i dislike to the maximum even that didn't manage to sway my opinion). this isn't one of those movies, and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie. i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition, see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say "oooooh what a masterpiece, the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity" when in actual fact all it is, is bird excrement on a board.keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie, thanks for reading!

i received this movie in a pack called "50 all-star movies" for $18 (45 cents each). many are good. this one was terrible. it was a hackneyed retread done 1000 times before and each time better. a crippled ex-jock is dared to coach a team made up of juvenile delinquents. they learn from him that they can make it if they play by the rules. i'm sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in a "real tv movie", but i can't imagine what the folks that launched and produced this project figured they could bring to this already over beaten subject. i kept waiting to see that 'new twist' or 'new angle' but, honest, it doesn't come. avoid this movie. forget about the 45 cents, i want the 96 minutes of my life back.

like another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a 20 movie family pack. i guess you could say that this was a decent made-for-tv movie for 1980, but it is super-predictable and the acting, except for robert conrad, is generally sub-par. the football scenes are nothing special and seem to mainly act as filler for the movie. the movie is very dated now, but a decent remake could probably make this into a good movie. however, is that really necessary? i mean, how many "underdog sports team works together for the big game with the undefeated guys" movies do we really need? this is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the bargain bin, but a sports movie buff will find it lacking.

i don't know if this type of movie was as cliché then as it seems to be now.considering how many "bad news bears" films had already been released by 1980, however, i think that this sort of movie was already a tired idea.a former football player is partially paralyzed in vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair. the chicago bears offer him a pr job but he wants to coach. at the same time, his underage nephew is picked up for armed robbery. we are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now serve some hard time...which turns out to be less than a year! of course, the kid is actually a good kid who only needs a tough male role model in his life. the same goes for all of the kids in the detention facility. yes...even the one locked up for attempted murder! i'm sure you already know what happens so i'll try and keep the rest of this brief.our protagonist becomes the coach of the kids' football team. he overcomes the delinquents' cynicism and earns their respect. his team faces off against a local high school team (yeah right!) and they get their butts kicked. now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach, he demands a rematch. will these underprivileged, scrappy kids with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch? awful execution of the football sequences ruins any possibility of excitement in this film. "coach of the year" should get penalized for roughing my brain. 1/10

when this movie was made in 1980, i was a teenager in the football stands playing as part of the audience. this was done at mooseheart, illinois. the big letters spelling out "mooseheart" at the top of the stands were covered up with a banner in the movie. the director would tell us to cheer loudly at certain points, as if a touchdown was being made. st. charles juvenile correction center is a real place less than 30 miles from mooseheart, although i think it may have closed down recently. during one scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. right below them, you can see my sister noel's head (she was 11 at the time). in the vhs version, i can only see the top of her head, but when i saw it on tv in 1981 i could see her whole head and my sister jacqui as well.i thought the movie itself was ok for a made for tv movie. since there's already a description of the movie here, i need not repeat it. it's worth seeing at least once.

a child-like puppeteer, for a public access children's show, goes over the deep end when he discovers kids he entertains at a hospital were victims of horrible abuse. this movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever come across. not an exploitation film as much as an afterschool special on the dangers of child abuse. seemingly harmless, mr. rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children. the children are emotionless and zombie-like(..due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them), the parents loud, inconceivably harsh, contemptible, and belligerent. the mothers, in particular, are so obscene, you'll root for their execution. they are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids. our detectives are a tired lot, frustrated with the whole judicial process, how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission. while the crimes themselves are heinous, the film doesn't explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen. i'd say the reason to see this is for tom basham's performance as the unbalanced man-child who slips into psychosis. there's quite a weird dinner table sequence between basham's mr. rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child, regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible mark(..notice the changes in behavior, pretty impressive work, going from innocent to creepy). peter renaday is lt. hayes, the detective in charge of the homicides cases, expressing on his face the strain that is taking it's toll on him. there's an early performance by john ashton as detective matthews, always raising the ire of hayes because of his inability to follow directions, not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids. awkward laid-back bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this. controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much. a bit too slow moving for my tastes, but there's an effective use, i felt, of basham's eyes before he takes care of business, waiting patiently as he prepares to strike.

this movie over does it on the cgi i mean sci-fi really they over did it the original '' bats'' is better it does not use cgi like the sequel. in this movie its the simple people running from mutated killer bats. and really bats in afghanistan?! the plot involves u.s army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attack by bats and dying<_< but the reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera zooms in on the soldiers. the acting is bad and this doesn't even look like a horror movie. in all this movie is a fairly good tv movie for sci-fi channel. but if like sci-fi's movies you'll like this movie because you just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie don't be surprised. oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead.

okay, i can sit through almost any movie, and i tend to get a real kick out of sci fi originals, but there was a major flaw in this movie that made me have to turn it off half an hour into it.having served in the us army, there are certain expectations in a movie including the military. at least some semblance of attention to proper military rank, uniform, and terminology is necessary if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience. "bats: human harvest" had characters wearing rank that was facing the wrong direction on the lapel and, later in the movie, the time was listed as 11:00 hours, but it was full dark outside. even if the script was perfectly done, and the dialogue spectacular, and the acting oscar-worthy, if the people making the movie don't care enough about the movie to even bother to look up the proper way to display military time, why should anybody bother to attempt to watch it?

i have yet to watch the first entry in this series, however, fortunately, i was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot, with all its unexpected twists and turns, and i applaud them for the utter originality of the concepts herein. in case there is any confusion, let me leave no doubt as to the fact that everything i've just said is coated in pure, carefully nurtured sarcasm, the kind that flourishes and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this flick. a clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator, whose only other credit in that field is a henry rooker film that wasn't well received. the acting is average at best, and i defy anyone to not find... scottish computer-woman(come on, seriously, what is with that last name?)'s russian accent laughable and/or irritating. there is an attempt or two at stylization in this, and they are reasonable. the action isn't terrible. cinematography and editing are fine. the music is cool enough. language is infrequent, if even that. violence is fairly bloody. i recommend this solely to fans of b-movies, and i will say that you can do worse than this. 1/10

an elite american military team which of course happens to include two good looking women and a guy who can't quite grasp teamwork, lots of bats, some terrorists, and a spetznaz team that acts like the gang that can't shoot straight -- all thrown together in a jumbled plot with mediocre acting. this one has nothing much going for it. the characters are not compelling. even the setting, which has great possibilities, looks like something out of the middle of rural pennsylvania, not an exotic boreal forest in eastern europe.the bats are certainly ferocious looking. they can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet (harpies?) or chop off an arm. you see delta force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guys shooting assault rifles and pistols at them and bat flopping to the ground. it would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. utterly clueless. the dialogue is rancidly unrealistic, with boy/girl jokes and flirts in the middle of tense parts of the mission. one of the team is blown up by a mine and the first one on the scene just stares sadly at his body, stunned, not even bothering to take cover or secure the area. in fact after the rest of the group shows up he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield -- thanks for the heads up bub.if you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out outpost. harvest is not the movie you want to see. in fact i think i'm going to give it a two instead of a three if i can make it through the second half. seems unlikely at this point.

dull one-note characters with next to no development, unimpressive performances by people who sound like they're simply reading lines, and ludicrous special effects combine to make this a genuine stinker. the story begins with eminently bland commando russo and his fellow soldiers attacking an al-qaeda training base. the scene tells us that al-qaeda has recently come to seek an ultimate weapon, and also serves to illustrate russo's only character trait, a tendency to eschew teamwork. with the help of a collection of blank slates and walking stereotypes, including a russian spy, russo travels to chechnyan territory to catch a mad scientist working for the terrorists. along the way, they encounter vast hordes of flesh-eating bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason. from there, the movie becomes nothing more than a dragging morass of ridiculous action, including a scene in which a swarm of bats slices a soldier's arm off!

i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the cosby show was for bill cosby, it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character. michael kyle an interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person. he is phenomenal in movies, but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though i loved it, i felt that the laugh was more important than plausibility.jay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school daze and martin, this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co-star in. i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it workedjr just plain stupid, his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness, we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing, which drives me nuts!!!!!!!! not to mention that most of the situations (in episodes i've seen) seems to center around himclair the attractive sister who dated a christian, i found her boyfriend's character to be more interesting than she was (she'd be better off sticking to movies, the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it's not stereotypical enough)kady lovable and the youngest daughter. i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklinfranklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy (t.j. mowry) which only lasted one season. they did a great job of casting for this little genius (the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also)all in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's homage to the cosby show is well done, i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that. i can't wait to see the series finale

i remember when i first heard about jack frost. i was in video ezy at miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition. it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store. browsing the various titles, i finally came across jack frost. the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures. years later the film disappeared, only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel. i once again ventured to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion: the film would be scary but not intentionally.jack frost 2: revenge of the killer mutant snowman (quite a title) follows off where it's predecessor left it. sheriff sam is seeking counseling after his ordeals and jack is now in the form of anti-freeze. to escape his past, sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including busty female models, thick headed sports jocks and caribbean staff. however, jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods. he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death. only sam can stop him.let me just say that this is a straight-to-video film so it's bound to be bad. but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films. the camera work is poor, using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic. half the actors look like they've come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like they've come out of a retirement home, but in actual fact they've actually come out of an asylum. there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland puppetry and cgi that can be bettered by an infant, and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless, yet deserving, victims. but the film is most memorable for it's killer one liners such as "there's something that needs a little christmas stuffing" and "i know pronounce you officially f***ing dead!" ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that. to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must've taken some nerves of steel or a total frontal lobotomy. to director michael cooney thanks for wasting my time. to everyone else avoid like arsenic.

jack frost 2. the worst "horror film" i have ever seen. why? 1)the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2) the damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on! 3) it escapes after being completely submerged in anti-freeze (first film) 4) get this...it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film. 5) "killer snowballs". i have yet to be drunk enough to see "ginger dead man" so as of the writing of this, jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest "horror" film ever. even surpassing the inaneness of it's predecessor (if you can believe that!).

jack frost 2 is out of the question, i'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies.as sam and his wife take to the tropicana for a relaxing christmas, jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding...don't take a swip at this film at all, most people say its a laugh with your mates, but frankily its a waste of time. if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story, especially the cheesy character names.

this is the worst film i have ever seen, bar none. from the flimsy-looking, poorly lit sets, to the laughable acting, to the infantile plot and shoddy, drawn-out action sequences, this film is so bad, its hilarious. for about ten minutes. after which you will be reaching for the remote or the power socket to end this film non-experience. although it was obviously made with the entire production and acting staff's collective tongue rammed in cheek (please god), i found jack frost 2 so dreadful as to be unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour. if you have not had enough of it after this time, you must be indulging in drug abuse.

why did i have to go out and buy (yes buy!) jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman??? maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost. it was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george. that and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). so i thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? well, i was so dead wrong! let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. i mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? as much as i love the premise, i really hated the movie. first of all: while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. it has this way too slick shot-on-video look. the lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). the acting... well don't even go there. the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that jamaican man was just moronic, saying "man" after every sentence). and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all i could think of was a seventh-rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.the best joke was were one guy asks "why are you talking to your watch?". and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. but the worst thing about this movie was: where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. a lot of people were killed off in original ways here, but all off-screen. like i've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the dvd) wasn't even in the movie. i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning i didn't see sh!t!). i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then i get to see nothing?!?! what a let-down! could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie? that would be a shame, 'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. they made munchies look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. but i guess that was the whole point of it. at some point, the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi. boy, you really have to see it to believe it. best is to not see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too bad (okay, i did laugh with it, for it kept getting worse and worse). just stick with the first jack frost (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).it's funny, but writer/director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2, and then focused on writing. turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside (starring ryan phillippe) and identity (starring john cusack). so the man seems to have some talent after all.now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible. so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. way to go mr. cooney!

horrible movie. this movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the worst movie i have ever suffered through. what the !@$% were the morons who made this film thinking. was it supposed to be scary. because man let me tall you it wasn't. it was so dumb it wasn't funny. we all know that tropical islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer snowmen. and those stupid baby snowballs. stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. fake snow and lousy actors. oh and frost looks nothing like he does on the box. do not waste your time. rent it and destroy it.

please, if you're thinking about renting this movie, don't. if you're thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips, don't. if i had my way, nobody would even have to read this summary.the acting, despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic. the director was probaly a sadist. the witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti-social 7 year olds that eat paint-chips for breakfast.the problem with this movie, is that it tries to be a movie like "evil dead 2"(do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies) in that it's so bad it's funny. but it also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly to do so, that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an attmept to save itself.i could go on for much much more, detailing just how awful it really was, but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it. if you need me, i'll be off trying to boil myself so that i might feel clean again...

if you like bad movies (and you must to watch this one) here's a good one. not quite as funny as the first, but much lower quality. a must-see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing.

in all, it took me three attempts to get through this movie. although not total trash, i've found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to, such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaper.the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do; people won't really pay to see either, the notoriety you earn won't be the best for you personally, but at least the commercials get air time.the first one was bad, but this gave the word bad a whole new definition, but it does have one good feature: if your kids bug you about letting them watch r-rated movies before you want them to, tie them down and pop this little gem in. watch the whining stop and the tears begin. ;)

alright, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently not a very good one. the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office blurting out random rhymes about jack frost. gee, alright my brother is yelling ''turn it off!''. anyway, back to the crappy movie.the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff. i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie, but he looks nothing like him!. yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people.. i don't quite see how this has to do anything, but their poking the anti-freeze/evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. nothing. alright, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. the janitor walks in, cleans stuff, bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive.behold the power of mocha! now somehow he is in..uh.. i believe the bahamas... but it looked more like hawaii.. but it couldn't be hawaii! unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets. bah.. i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self... er... i wouldn't suggest doing so though.... sheesh..

jack frost 2 was a horrible, terrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie. the original, was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. and the snowman went around murdering people, and avoiding blow dryers like the plague. this, however, was a far cry from the quality of the original. it seems like this even had a lower-budget because for some reason, after an hour into this film, i still hadn't seen the snowman. some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice-over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character. disappointing to no belief, even for a fan of bad cinema.

-may contain spoilers-clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. i just can't see it any other way. what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.anyhow, where to begin. the bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than george w. bush's college career. i don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack frosts' were getting killed. also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. "how do we know it's him?" like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! a great camp film, but a very bad film overall.

this movie sucks. did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms. there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else. this movie blows hard, painful to sit through too. stay far away.

yes, in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make. it has its funny moments, but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me. you can not come up with a good story, your effects are going to really be bad, hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie. the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort. it also had better effects too, this one is just a step or two ahead of "hobgoblins" as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets. still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost. actually, i am just kidding, but really it was the funniest part of the movie.

ill-conceived sequel(..the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules(..it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept).i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists, but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting. anyway, the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival(..i mean seriously, why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).the "snow anvil" murder scene takes the cake. ice icicles protrude from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them. oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie..such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone("oh, it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!")or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. jack frost has the power to freeze water(..then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow. one sequence has jack freezing pool water, encasing a swimming model under the sheet, result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.oh, there's also a recreation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit from the christmas story("cowatonga dude!").i gotta hand it to the cast, though..they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining. christopher allport(..perhaps unwisely)returns as sam, to face his old nemesis, as does eileen seeley, as his wife. the attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor(..for me, at least) fell flat, but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the introduced foreign elements, allow him to withstand coolant/anti-freeze, and, even worse, he now can reproduce..through indigestion, jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans, but i personally found this junk rather hokey(..that's the purpose behind it, i suppose, cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable.the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort. the weapon against them..bananas! it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film, both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze(..an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed, and i guess in their being "being linked" by the icicle, jack inherited sam's banana allergy, or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both "merged" in a sense.phew, such a film as this defies simple explanation. it's a film with effects and plot so terrible, one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings.

having already seen the original "jack frost", i never thought that "jack frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. boy was i wrong! then again, a-pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. i believe this is the first a-pix sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more a-pix sequels.it's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. they are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which i have to say looks very cheesy. the computer animation surprised me, as the first "jack frost" had no such effects.i'd strongly recommend that you see the original "jack frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).now only if there was "uncle sam 2"...

after kenneth opel's rousing story of the invigorated me back into the pleasure of reading during grade school, i had high hopes for this series. the story of an underdog bat voyaging across country to reunite with his colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my burgeoning imagination.upon hearing of this series, i began browsing bardel animation's site and liked what i saw. the character design looked impressive and the fast-paced plot seemed to have been stretched respectably across a thirteen episode arc. much was my disappointment, then, when i decided to watch a rerun early one morn.the opening episode shows our hero, shade silverwing, pursuing a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night. chirruping an echolocatory song, we see a nifty if crude cgi effect illuminate the moth, and the chase takes on a frenetic turn as the tiny insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself do deceive its pursuer. as a lover of biology, i had a decent understanding of the principles in place (tiger moths can sense the sounds their predators use for echolocation and spin a sonic cover for themselves) but without such exposition i would have surely been lost. a minor quibble, i thought. surely they director will fill us in momentarily. i waited in vain.once our protagonist roosts down with some of his fellows, we are treated to some of the dullest dialog i've ever seen on television. chinook, shade's childhood rival, begin taunting the diminutive hero with the stupidest lines i've ever seen on a show. i can understand the writers not producing shakespeare, but one would think they'd have had some social contact in their lives - surely enough to make communication seem natural. oh, how wrong i was.the voice acting, while not horrendous, hardly was a shining example of human achievement. "oh shade, you're broken the law!" shade's mother sighs emptily. "you must come with me, young one." croaks frieda, the wizened elder of the silverwing colony. the actors try, but it hardly matters at this point, as the story becomes less and less compelling with each pass minute.while each episode deals with a problem of the week, as is typical of with most television series, overarching story arcs pervade the saga, for better and worse. while the main point of the story is shade's reunion with his family, later episodes tack on other story arcs, involving cannibalistic bats from the southern jungles and a brewing war between birds and beasts. the writers try to do too much at once, fighting to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hopes that it will grab audience interest enough to keep the bloody show going on. unfortunately, these attempts are futile to all but the eight to ten year olds at whom this show is aimed.while it's nice to see canadian media be perpetuated, it would be all the sweeter if the enjoyability of the series wasn't limited to the immediate family of the animators or frothing fans of kenneth oppel's books. there are worse things out there your children could be watching than silverwing, but far better programs are out there, too. pass on the mediocrity and read the books instead.

there were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. i'll give you three.1. sienna guillory. she is extremely hot in this movie and was the reason i chose to watch it in the first place.2. tim curry. amazing bad guy and i always get excited seeing him in movies (even home alone 2).3. jason donovan. for all you aussies and poms out there, this is a rare treat. former neighbours star 80's heart-throb dressed in drag selling drugs.however none of these things nor the fact that the movie is about the drug/rave culture managed to make this movie even remotely interesting. the script was dull, the performances ordinary and despite the scenes with j.d and any scene with sienna i found everything about this movie pretty passe.3 out of 10.

a rather disappointing film. the club scenes were ok, but over done. the plot was thin and boring. it's only redeeming features were some of the characters. the chemist and the dj were pretty fun characters. tim curry's character was just bizarre and stupid.

a pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving british club scene, sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments, but does very little else. a perfunctory thriller plot (which is there merely to string the club sequences together), variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script, all stop sorted from being the showcase that director jovy obviously intended.however, although jovy is sometimes over indulgent (especially when using the often ill-fitting dance music) he does show potential, and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing. overall however, the film is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere. watchable nevertheless.

this cosy middle class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as ben elton. did it deserve such malice? well terry and june was never clever, it was never a well-written tale with different threads which intersect at the conclusion. it was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched. they chuckled rather than laughed, but they were never likely to be offended by the show, so the fact that it never challenged them was immaterial.one foot in the grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight to be just another terry and june.a few days after the death of terry scott an episode was broadcast on terrestrial tv, and that has been its final outing. there have been few repeats of the show on any tv channel.thankfully tv comedy has advanced since terry and june. it's hard to find kind words for it - terry scott did make the best of weak scripts.

this show lasted for most of the 1980s, and had its moments, but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunny.terry scott and june whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, they both deserved better, but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes. june whitfield's talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion (when she is not being a foil to terry) and she really is clever.the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class, middle aged comedy, and many people remember it fondly, but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image.

...an incomprehensible script (when it shouldn't have been) dependent on a rather flaky voice-over.the animation, however, show real talent.quite visually impressive.

there is a reason to call this a teen flick. out of 100 possible points i would put it somewhere in the teens. it is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all else it is super predictable. the ending is so hokey that i should have left early and maybe it would have passed. by the way, could you call the male lead a pervert? i bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said so. finally, in the school i grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have picked out a chump like josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd. my final word is save your time, when it comes on tv watch something better, like the stock quotes.

i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn't want to watch anything too heavy, i picked the perfect film. this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with, the director raja gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious. in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling? they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts, in skin tight leotards, ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only fig leaves? she announces that she's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying? the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment? they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids? i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble??? nahhhh no problem. didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point? the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype. jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom? and they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history. if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life. this movie is so contrived and predictable it's nauseating, and why at the end is everybody (the alpo girls included) cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her????dumb, dumb and dumb.

brilliant acting, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of diarreha on my head for the entire film. instead, i endured a 2 hour crap-o-rama. our "brilliant" story begins with some billionare who has nothing better to do than look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms. instead, he finds a 5'4" man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some queer cave-folk.in his infinite wisdom, (along with his infinitely large nose)he decides to go inside this volcano with a team of "special" people. to travel to this underground land, they go by plane? no. boat? no. they use this giant soup can with a "solid metal" drill on the end that i swear i saw wobble. in summation, this movie was faker than....oh that's right! this was the fakest movie i've seen! for those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie; i warn you! if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy.eccchhh!! the rating system only allows for a minimum of 1/10. i give this a -10/10!

kinda boring, kinda gross, kinda unsettling, this wasn't horrible, but not too good. there's a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life, though, props to this scene. not much happens, and the movie just feels sort of scummy. i was happy when it ended, and don't believe anything about this being a true story....very surprised this is averaging around 6.

an art student in rome is possessed...or something. she has dreams of being nailed to a cross and satan himself raping her. he possesses her (i think) and turns her into a sex addict. that's about all i could take and i turned it off.a pointless "exorcist" rip off. i caught this on cable back in the 80s and was horrified...and not in a good way! this movie is supposed to be a horror film but turns into nothing more than a sex film disguised as a horror movie. there's tons of pointless female nudity and the actress playing the lead has to degrade herself more than once. we see her being raped by satan (a hot-looking guy), masturbating, coming on to her own father...gotta give her points for bravery. add to that bad dubbing, editing (the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit), lousy acting and a story that makes next to no sense. the one disturbing sequence (her being nailed to the cross) almost works but the lousy "special" effects ruin it. this is one of the few horror film that was so bad i stopped watching. skip it.

wow! what a horrible, hideous waste of time this celluloid atrocity turned out to be. i remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun but now...it's just plain silly. not to mention the fact that it is a blatant rip-off of "the exorcist" to the point where it was re-released at one point under the title "the sex-orcist". the only real difference is that the producers have the gall to further discredit themselves by slapping on the claim that the events in the film are real! who in their right mind would actually believe such a bold faced lie? to make matters even worse, there was a video release in circulation with cover art that blatantly tried to cash in on the "rocky horror picture show" by throwing a pair of lips on the cover! how low could one possibly sink? do not be fooled by the false claims, blatant lies or title rip-off because you will be sorely disappointed if you do!

i just can't get it, freaks out on the planet are talking about this one as a must seen, they even dare to call it a (s)exploitation because the possessed girl is seducing priests and is masturbating all time. don't let me laugh. i watched the movie, seducing is only at the end of the movie and don't call it seducing,it's just bad language that's she is talking. and the masturbationscene is a big laugh too, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you perverts out there. it isn't gory or bloody at all, everybody is vomiting on beyond the door, well, let me tell, that one is for me better than this flick. only the last 5 minutes the possessed one is vomiting and having weird eyes. if i had know that this is so bad then i would never caught me a copy. if you really wan't to see a (s)exploiation about exorcism watch angel above, the devil below or other cheesy ones. a waist of time this is.

out of the handful of alternative titles in english, "the sexorcist" is definitely the most appropriate one, since this is basically just a shameless rip off of william friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced 13-year-old linda blair with the 19-year-old stella carnacina only so that she could gratuitously show her ravishing naked body. i'm not sure what exactly satan tries to accomplish here, but he exclusively seems to possess the young girl to play sexual tricks on her! poor danila masturbates around the clock and tries to seduce priests and even her own father into having sex with her. the young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology-student with an odd-looking boyfriend (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving, albeit adulterous parents. when she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renovate, the ancient relic comes to life and no less than satan himself (played by ivan rassimov of "jungle holocaust" and "planet of the vampires") starts to torment her. the overlong masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the movie, and then finally director mario garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. that final segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! the priests don't really do anything apart from saying some vague prayers but, somehow, danila seems cured all of a sudden. there isn't much gore, the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate every little flaw by adding more sleaze! this is one of the strangest italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why the hell are they referring to "the rocky horror picture show"?), but definitely not one of the best. if you fancy clones of "the exorcist", i recommend "demon witch child", "beyond the door" and "the antichrist".

the film is somewhat entertaining, but the greatest feature is shalom harlow's laughable performance. it has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully harlow has gone through more training. perhaps she should stick to the more worldly, somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances.

i was an extra on this film but wish i wasn't because its rubbish. the worst thing about this film is the music but the acting, script, editing, directing and story are terrible as well. the main reason its bad is because the budget is so low and the only way to make good film on a low budget is to have a good script. the script which should have been ripped up before the film was made isn't funny, i didn't laugh once. what did make me laugh is how makers probably think the most important thing was getting the film made, who cares if its total rubbish. the film needed about million pound more budget and a better writer. the only reason i didn't give the film one out of ten is because i felt sorry for the guy who is gonna lose a few hundred grand making this, if you do go and see it just make sure your drunk at the time. ha ha

i don't even know where to begin...it's is not worth typing a review so i will just quote what another user posted because i agree thoroughly, but i give it 1 / 10 instead of 2 / 10 "i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was. the initial precept was promising, but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful. let's run through the main points. plot - good initial idea but truly terrible development. there were many points when i thought "no, nobody would do something that stupid". the ending was amazingly anticlimactic. characterisation - all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures. i keep trying to think of one that wasn't - possibly the mother, but that's it. music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. direction - totally amateurish. cinematography - doubt they've heard of it. camera angles / stability / zoom levels often really bad. i am totally bemused at how this film has scored so highly. it's the worst movie i've seen at the cinema for years, if not ever."

with matthias hues on the cover and only $3.00, i had to buy it. i enjoyed some moments, like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids, but i only really watched to see matthias hues' scenes. i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end. it was a cross between clint eastwood's "the good, the bad and the ugly" and "for a few dollars more" (a 3 man quick-draw showdown, with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer). apart from that, there's really nothing more i can add. the actors gave good performances, (all except the "assassin droid" whose performance was nothing outside of comical) but the movie really lacked depth and purpose; simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time, so we're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so, until the ball gets rolling. for example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, taking up two-fifths of the movie.the scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the films budget. i don't think we ever did get to see this "perfect city" of new angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached new angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in. the "super-high security" of new angeles was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to matthias' approximation of "at least a hundred men out there".if you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses in this film, then you may want to watch it, simply to "add it to the list". however, if you value 1 and a half hour of your time, or $3.00 of your money, you may want to give this one a miss.

troma founder, lloyd kaufman is the crapkeeper in this anthology film made up of two films that were such celluloid feces that llyod tried to salvage them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in copious amounts of nudity whenever possible. does it work? nope, it's still crap that i'd have to scrape off my boots if i stepped in it.will anyone like this mess? sure, young teen aged mongoloids with the combined iqs of a vienna sausage have to laugh at something, i guess. for those who have brains that are even semi-functioning steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence, even "dude, where's my car" would do.my grade: f

"tales from the crapper" is gory, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and scatological. but that's ok, i was prepared for all that from my previous troma experiences. what i wasn't prepared for is that it's also witless, unfunny and boring. very little of the genuine anarchic spirit of films like "class of nuke'em high" has remained intact; in its place, we get endless fart jokes (to the point where you start wondering if lloyd kaufman is going senile, thinking that adults find loud farting so darn hilarious!) and a cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "film" that even kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place. oh yes, there is plenty of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn film probably offers a better storyline, higher production values, funnier humor, and above all more respect for its intended viewer than this atrocity. p.s: kelly powers aka suzi lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the "how to make your own movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen.

i understand that this was llyod kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the pits. the whole movie is voiced over since the audio reel was junk. the voice overs were so bad and terrible quality. as much as i love troma, they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work. the acting was terrible. one thing i did enjoy from this movie was the quick cameo of trey parker doing the aristocrats joke with a goofy wig on. there are a lot of big director dudes in this movie like james gunn and eli roth (friends of lloyd kaufman). again i think this was llyods attempt of saving a crappy movie and trying not to lose 1000s of dollars. i won't go on and on but this movie was a mess. check out other troma titles.

while the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "turd" was the breast count, but that wasn't enough to make me watch this again. all said and done i'm actually dumber from watching this movie. this was a new low for troma. lloyd kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what i was getting into. this was by far one of the worst ever put out by the troma team. the best place to show this movie would be to invalids, sense they can't get up to change the channel. to conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.

when voting i was going to give a 2 but when seeing that 1 meant awful it hit the nail on the head.the portrayal of native americans as blood thirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me.this is the third film i've seen of d.w. griffiths where races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways.the man isn't able to tell his side of the story so i'm going to try and keep away from attacking mr. griffith personally.in my opinion the three films probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their children's children.films like this probably made for many of the resentments that are still with us..some may say the camera work was great,the action a first for it's time.the positives are far outweighed by the negatives,it's like someone taking $10 from you and giving a dime back to make up for it.

oddball black-comedy romance featuring a great cast and a less than stellar script. brenda blethyn ("lovely & amazing") is the title character 'betty', a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with his beautiful, blonde secretary. guess who's playing this minor role, yup! naomi watts ("mulholland drive") must of sandwiched this project in before her superstar status was insured with the blockbuster thriller "the ring."on the male side of the cast list there's the woefully miscast alfred molina ("frida") an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for 'betty' which have lain dormant for decades. perhaps miramax is hoping molina's turn in the upcoming "spider-man 2" might generate some interest in this little trinket which belongs on the dvd rental shelf.but the award for wildest thankless performance goes to christopher walken ("catch me if you can") who goes completely over the top as 'modern' undertaker with his vegas-style funerals in a small provincial town. his character must have parachuted into the village because there's little reason for him to exist in this script.that said, if you'd like to see some top-notch actors engage in some low-brow humor then this one's for you, and if this isn't your cup-of-tea then try renting "harold and maude," the ultimate funeral movie that's still funny to this day.

first of all "mexican werewolf in texas" is not a werewolf movie. this title is bullcrap. the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas. i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. and i guess it actually works because that's the reason why i bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. anyway the movie isn't any good. actually it's bloody awful. but i didn't expect anything else when i bought it. it's a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster. if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. but i must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad.this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen. the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. they almost never say a line in a normal way. they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. it's so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. it's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. she's the worst of them all. i have never seen an actor as bad as her (and i've seen pteradactyl). even when her boyfriend dies she can't stop being a bimbo about it. i hate her.some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. the gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. the effects are pretty hilarious really, but that's the way i like it. the chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it's easy to see that it's a guy in suit.overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.

i must say i was disappointed with this film. although it is well acted and directed, the underlying story simply plods along too slowly.granted, in another mood i would have liked it better. i did chuckle a lot, but rarely laughed out loud; and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won. but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day (one neither of us had heard of before) this one paled in comparison.if you see lots of movies, then by all means see this -- it's distinctly better than your average fare. but if you (like me) have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining, save this for later.[rate: 7/10]

if it had not been for christopher guest's hilarious role, i would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. the jokes were flat, the movie choppy and slow paced, certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch, but guest's character kept me laughing so i stuck with it.i do feel there are much better choices out there!

i could not stand the woman who played the mother. i wanted her to shut up. she had a bizarre manner of speaking and the lines she was given to read didn't make it any better. i had no idea why the men of the town were so taken with her to cause all these problems except that in a town populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. even after a terrible tragedy her voice was devoid of human emotion, she seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of her life. she delivered her lines with the same emotion whether she was saying "i love you", "i hate you", "the bank is foreclosing", "my dress is on fire". was this actually filmed in ireland? the sun blazed throughout the movie and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the harvest. i lived in ireland during the summer of 2002, the wettest summer in a century. most everything was still harvested. if the farmers in ireland could only harvest during long dry stretches then the country would have starved hundreds of years ago. it seems as if there wasn't a lot of money to make the movie. the black and white flashbacks looked as if they were filmed with the security cameras one can get at sam's club.

like the previous commentator on this film, i too found myself in tears at times during this movie. sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe-inspiring awfulness comes into existence. from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses (what irish emigrant hasn't had that one), its clear we are in trouble. and it doesn't get much better.whisked back to 1950s ireland, we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation, and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war. schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war. the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances. remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war. the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget...the civil war. every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war.the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland. the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic: house prices. if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into ireland's obsession with its past, it fails miserably. it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies. however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche.for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland: it doesn't. 1950s ireland was a horrible, poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves. however there was more than one topic of conversation.

as a kid, i never understood why anyone would watch this very crappy show. it was pretty stupid and i always wanted spridle and jim-jim to get in some sort of fatal accident (they were that annoying).now, almost 40 years later, i have a new attitude about the cartoon. while i still think it was complete crap, this is only in regard to the american version of the show. that's because i was reading a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in japan. you see, the idiots in charge of syndicating the series thought it was too violent so they cut this out of the episodes. that's bad enough, but what else they did is beyond belief--they actually chopped the episodes apart and spliced them together to create shows that were nothing like the originals! for example, one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! as a result, i really don't know if the original show really was bad--it might have been brilliant. but who can tell considering all we have to watch is this americanized mess!?

this son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least. you would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released, however retro puppet master was not directed by or written by the original writers and contained poor story, lack of any emmontional connection to any characters, and dragged out slowly scene to scene. no build up of strong plot, very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly getting antsy throughout the movie, if you can sit through the whole reel. i never could understand why a horror movie continues making sequels after the release of their "final chapter." i hardly suggest watching this flick, but if you must i wouldn't recommend making anyone else sit through it with you.

this film may have been the first puppet master but this sure bored me to death when i saw this stupid movie,i wanted a refund. this was a bad series to the puppet master and i'm sure that i am not the only one that thinks this was terrible. to some it was great but, to others it was a ticket to snores-ville and boy are they right. the puppets didn't even do anything nor did they kill people. it should't be seen by people so i'm warning you not to see it. you will be disappointed even to the fans who love puppet master, it was a waste of their time and it didn't make so much money.nobody even got kill but one or two,very pointless.1/10

this is officially the terrible, boring, corny, and ridiculous movie ever created. the movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends, and they land a 747. his dreams are very corny and make no sense at all, and is very poorly done. every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology, and might have been created by the kid that plays the "leading role" in the movie. if you watch this movie, it will definitely make you stupider. i advise you to never consider watching this movie, and if you do, good luck and don't miss the brain cells you killed off. my comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made. the person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that i dreadfully watched, and wish i never watched. peace.

oh, how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their goldenboy paul schrader (author of taxi driver) when this movie came out. i never saw the qualities they were detecting when i watched this movie back in the day, so i re-viewed it, to see if i got it wrong. mishima is extremely uninteresting. this is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture. the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy. and the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.it must be a triumph when you learn you've landed philip glass; but then you have to get something out of him. glasses score offers not a whit of distinction from his other work, nor does it provide the film any perceptible value. in 2010 it should be clear to anyone that schrader squandered his career on work of no impact or importance (cat people, autofocus, light sleeper, patty hearst, american gigolo). he can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else. schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.

ocean's twelve: just plain stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two.an art robbery. 10 known actors, at least. a weak script and very slow developing idea. that's why i characterize a movie i only saw at least 20 minutes of it. don't get me wrong, you may like it. but i only like the ocean's films because of the heist theme. if ocean's 12 it's not about heist then what's the point to see it? glad soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. kudos for that.steven soderberg isn't really a good director. apart from his hit "sex lies and videotapes"... nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director. shame on him. but his fault only.

i enjoyed oceans 11, i thought it was quite enjoyable, helped by the performances and the direction. however, i was disappointed with this film. don't get me wrong, it is not a complete dud, thanks to the stellar performances from brad pitt, catherine zeta-jones, george clooney and matt damon especially and the efficient direction from steven soderbergh. however, the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing, some of the film was so slow i almost fell asleep between one key twist. second, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. the camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. the screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. at the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction. so much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 bethany cox

what can i say about ocean's twelve? who thought that it would ever come to this? a gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and can't retrace. i found myself amazed at how bad this really was. really! i have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable. i'm a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel. what was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back? the movie is just boring and so drag along that i can't ever sit through this. it really is bad. just stay as far, repeat, far away as possible from this movie. it's worthless.

watching this movie brings several words to mind: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "improbable", "self-indulgent" and finally (and fatally), "boring". badly directed, badly photographed and badly acted, the film is a confusing mess with plot lines (if one can call them that) veering in all directions. someone may have used a five-year old's finger painting as a template. as punishment for this childish crime of a movie, this cast of "stars" should be spanked soundly and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . all in all, it seems like george needed an excuse to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation and we're the suckers paying for it. bad george! bad!

comparing oceans twelve to the 2001 oceans eleven, did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same?- all the stars returned for twelve, and zeta-jones was added;- twelve had the same director;- twelve had the same producers;- twelve had the same production designer;- twelve had the same music director;- twelve had the same film editor.did anyone notice the things than changed once the "oceans" franchise was established?- twelve's budget was $25 million (30%) greater;- eleven got great reviews, but twelve largely got panned;- eleven made $450 million but twelve dropped to $362 million;- domestic box office for twelve dropped 32%;- soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriter.movies are a director's medium, of course. i almost forgot.

"cover girl" is a lacklustre wwii musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it, save for its signature song, "long ago and far away." this film came out before gene kelly really hit his artistic stride, and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here, mostly he plays sidekick to rita hayworth. and there's the problem. rita hayworth is gorgeous, no doubt about that. but she's simply not a compelling screen presence. i've always found myself wanting to like her more than i actually do, and this movie is no exception. she's simply not a very good actress, and she's not even a very good dancer. good looking as she is, there's something vapid about her, and this movie suffers because of it.grade: c-

i didn't expect a lot when i went out to see this, but my god what a disappointment. the original was kind of fun within it's genre, but this is so bad, i felt abused when i left the theater. there's no plot, it's not funny, it's not enjoyable to watch, it's straight out embarrassing. after an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater. do yourself a favor and ignore this one, see it when it comes to the small screen. or see it on budget dvd, whatever you do don't waste any money on it. don't say i didn't warn you.

do you get it? like the car. these are the jokes, folks. softcore beach blanket bingo with aliens answers many of life's important question. what do the relatives of celebrities do for some cash? how does a hot tan alien wash herself? how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? well, maybe not that one. linnea quigley, member of the softcore hall of fame, provides some comic relief. nikki fritz, also a member, show her talents. sarah bellomo is not as bad as you might expect from a porn star. this is not erotic, except the shower scene, and not funny enough to make up for the rotten plot. the sequel has a couple of pleasant scenes as well with miss bellomo.p.s. the title is a good example of alliteration.

yes, it was an awful movie, but there was a song near the beginning of the movie, i think, called "i got a woody" or something to that effect. i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available. i saw this song on mst 3k, and as awful as it was, it had it's moments, and that song was one of them.if you like babes in bikinis, this is the movie for you, but if you don't, then don't bother. it was great material for mst 3k, i have to admit though. i would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though. not just that song, but a couple more were really funny, and are classics as far as i'm concerned.

tacky, but mildly entertaining early 90's soft core comedy features xena (sarah bellemo), luna (tamara landry), and sola (nicole posey), as three outer-space teenagers. xena's parents have gone on vacation for a couple of days. following some persistent persuasion from her friends, xena agrees to take her father's spaceship for a ride. the end result? they wind up running out of gas in space, and crash-land on planet beta 45, aka earth. meanwhile, teenagers dave (michael todd davis) and jerry (ken steadman) have come to california to stay the summer with dave's uncle bud (joe estevez ) a beach bum who lives right on the beach. the three of them wind up meeting our three space girls who have walked away from the crash without a scratch. uncle bud is about to be thrown out from his soon-to-be-condemned beach pad thanks to sally (linnea quigley), who lives right up the hill and used to be in a relationship with bud. she's also a bikini magnate, and is trying to win a bikini design contest to the tune of, $30,000....exactly what bud would need to fix up his property, so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. and that's about it, folks. knowing that their paper thin plot was barely enough to sustain a feature length movie, the filmmakers subject us to scene after scene of endless beach parties featuring tons of extras gyrating their half naked bodies in the scorching sun. oh, and lets not forget the sex. there's quite a deal of it. before i go any further, i need to put this movie in context. it was released in 1993, long before the advent of such soft core labels such as surrender cinema and seduction cinema. compared to these newer, edgier, more explicit movies, the soft core movies of the 90's sure seem somewhat mild. when beach babes from beyond first came out in 1993 from the full moon offshoot torchlight entertainment, it was heralded as the debut release of a label that specialized in "mature audiences" type films. needless to say, the times have changed. this particular film genre has gone from a few steamy, but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. looking at beach babes from beyond again after viewing it upon its 93' release, it's safe to say that if this same film were to be made today, there would be a hell of a lot more emphasis on the sex scenes and less time spent on plot and dialog. as for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to run hot-and-cold. our three space girls waste no time in getting comfortable with the boys that evening. so each couple gets a soft core scene, complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting. they're really not that horrible, and are surprisingly graphic in a few spots, especially the scene between xena and jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer. but the one sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression, and causes you to be surprised in its overall intensity, occurs quite early on in the film. sally is attending a topless photo shot with three of her models posing by a pool. all of the actresses in this scene are beautiful gorgeous, but nikki fritz stands out from all the two due to her enormous presence. remember that this point in her career she had yet to achieve the type of enormous popularity that soon would follow. her posing nude by a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her soapy body in a tub and then again when walking away from her bath. walking toward the bed towards a nearly nude pumped up guy in the waiting, we get a full length complete nude scene with her almost heart shaped rear end and perfectly shaped back. it's good that nikki's back is so muscular as it is about to get a pretty good workout. nikki spends the next few minutes completely nude with a hunky guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed completely differently than the three other lovemaking scenes. no dark lighting or annoying slow motion here...just two actors in one enormous bed sans sheets and covers who seem at time to be barely acting at all. nikki's ecstatic body language just goes to prove that few other actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does. it's really the only time where beach babes from beyond truly delivers the goods. but even without this spectacular scene, i am mildly recommending this film just for the fact alone that it's fairly watchable and never dull no thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of whom would show up in various direct to video features in the remainder of the decade.

i am easily pleased. i like bad films. i like films featuring attractive young women in small amounts of clothing.this film gives all the above a bad name. yes, you know going in that what you're getting is not high art, or anything like. but, even for the type of movie it is, beach babes from beyond isn't very good.some people have given it 10. i can only assume that these are people who have had the organs which enable rational thought to take place surgically removed.it isn't very good. it simply isn't very good.3 out of 10 solely on the grounds of a) novelty value for the famous relatives and burt ward and b) some of the girls are cute.oh, by the way, did i tell you that it isn't very good?

rita hayworth plays a brooklyn nightclub dancer named rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss gene kelly chomping at the bit. terribly tired piece of technicolor cotton candy, with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s, with hayworth portraying her own grandmother). kelly, as always, dances well but acts with false sincerity; when he's serious, he's insufferable, and the rest of the time he's flying on adrenaline. the script is a lead weight, not even giving supporting players phil silvers and eve arden any good lines. *1/2 from ****

like 'singin' in the rain', 'cover girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. in 'cover girl', phil silvers (genius) is the comic relief. he corresponds to donald o'connor's funny man part in 'singin in the rain'. in cover girl, gene kelly's love interest is rita hayworth and in 'rain', it's debbie reynolds. that's where the comparison ends.whereas "singin' in the rain' is a classic american movie musical, 'cover girl' is mediocrity incarnate. the story isn't very complicated. rusty parker (rita hayworth) is a dancer in danny macguire's low-rent nightclub in brooklyn. rusty decides to enter a cover girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, john coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for rusty's grandmother years ago. coudair introduces rusty to broadway producer noel wheaton who makes her into a star. danny feels slighted when rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, genius. at the last minute, with rusty at the altar with noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to danny. they live happily ever after.gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie. all we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with rusty. coudair and wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward rusty and phil silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. the most interesting aspect of rita hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. this foreshadows what happened to her in real life. anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown alzheimer's during the last years of her life.almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. gene kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'make em laugh' from 'singin' in the rain'.the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal. a couple of decades later, raquel welch had the same problem. both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. they wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. unfortunately, 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.

this movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in istanbul. as time passes, their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest--who is out of work and doesn't appear all that eager to find work. that's most of the movie in fact. the problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are very withdrawn and non-communicative, they don't make for a very satisfying movie. that's because most of the time he (and his roomie) just stare into space and say nothing. i think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie--i certainly wouldn't have minded.

i can't think of anything, i repeat, anything positive about this "movie"! the whole 1 hour 45 minute movie could be shrunken into a short 5-minute movie! in most scenes, there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie! all you see is someone in the background walking around or watching tv with no specific subject or even talk what so ever! i just feel i've wasted 105 minutes of my, my family's and my friends' weekend for nothing! if a movie is poorly made or the scenario isn't great that's whole another story, at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about distant, i just have to call it a "movie" because it was motion pictures recorded by a camera.if you haven't seen it, imagine a 105-min long movie based on two-three lines of story! what will you end up with? 5% of content and 95% of fillers! that's exactly how "distant" was at least for us! actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them, they barely talked or showed any special emotions! i picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what i read on the back of its cover. i'm still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie.

i should live this film, but i don't. it won international awards, it is foreign (i usually like such films) it is slow moving (again something i like) and it has no gratuitous sex or violence. the problem is that it is boring. we have two friends from the same village in turkey one "successful" the other not. the unsuccessful one comes to istanbul to stay with the successful in an attempt to get a good job at sea. both live lives that are unfulfilling, pointless and petty.well, it isn't the first time this kind of film has been made. i didn't see anything new being added to this tired theme. there are long takes that are just someone standing and looking at the sea or sitting in a coffee shop or watching tv. i do understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their loves, while it does do that i got the idea in the first 15 min. i don't need to be beaten over the head with it for the rest of the two hours.the symbolism is also a bit heavy handed. the plate of live minnow type fish with one off the plate and flopping around in its death throws. symbols are best when they are not obvious but are there, in the background, creating a mood just slightly below the viewer's awareness.the film is so apathetic, that it doesn't even rate a score of 1, so i gave it a 2. to rate a 1 takes a talent at being bad. this film didn't have that much energy.

i was fairly lost throughout most of this film, and i am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as david lynch (twin peaks: fire walk with me) and darren aronofsky (pi). not to say that northfork doesn't make sense on some level, it just doesn't combine to form a wholly coherent film. as time passes from watching the film, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, i was really confounded, and i find that this is the major fault of the film...its lack of direction. the plot centers on the town of northfork, montana in the year 1955. the town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro-electric dam. the major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated. a group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned, and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople. simultaneously, the film tells the story of irwin, a very sick young boy (or is he a fallen angel?) whose adopted parents gave him back, due to his illness, to the northfork orphanage that they adopted him from. father harlan (nick nolte) cares for the dying irwin, but irwin imagines (or does he?!) that a group of angels (including daryl hannah and anthony edwards) have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel. irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo. oh yeah, and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape. there are a lot of other small events that happen in the film, but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue. one can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement. like i wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, long after viewing, what has possibly taken place in the film. irwin is dying, and so is northfork, and in coping with his own loss and death, irwin has most likely created characters, from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage, to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end. but then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he has found his kind and can now return home. i must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, vivid and full of loneliness and sadness. unfortunately, the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete.

this is a good time to say how good i think of this site: it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration i lived for two hours, awaiting for something to happens, for something to be said, to be shown, to be insinuated subtly, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. no, just long, endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. boring is the long death of the mind, and this movie is, from that point of view, a public enemy. how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators. i don't claim for my money back, just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing... oh god !

first the easy part: this movie is pretentious crapola!it put me in mind of "magnolia". and then i thought "wow-- somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than "magnolia".i know nothing about the polish brothers, but this film seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling. the trite plot elements and sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough, but the dialogue is just pathetic. detailed comments would just be a laundry list of failure. the parts that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not; the "elegaic" parts are nice coffee table pictures with mediocre music; the "emotional" parts are simplistic.the worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters, except for a little cornball dignity in the priest.i still can't believe the respect some people have given this picture.

usually i'm the one criticizing the twenty-something neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic t*ts, gunfights and car chases. however, in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions. at least i wouldn't have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels.i don't mind surreal, and i certainly don't mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning, but there should be some point to the whole thing. i didn't get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were, instead, just so self-absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered. or perhaps they just got confused themselves. either way, i don't care. it bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving grace.although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited ravings about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography, i must respectfully disagree. perhaps i didn't mince through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals ...or perhaps this movie was just crap. i give it a "1" and file it next to "ishtar."

rita hayworth is just stunning at times and, for me, the only reason to watch this silly film. despite the overdone 1940s lipstick, rita was one of the all-time glamor women of hollywood. in fact, for a couple of years i can't imagine anyone that looked better, except maybe elizabeth taylor in her prime.anyway, the co-star of the show, gene kelly, does not play his normal likable, at least the kind of guy we all know him from in "singin' in the rain." here, kelly's "danny mcguire" pouts much of the time. phil silvers, who i loved on tv at "sgt. bilko," is so stupid in here as "genius" you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes....and they are stupid.the visuals are good with great technicolor, which almost looks terrific. you get to see a lot of pretty women in here, too, not just hayworth. unfortunately, the story isn't all that much. it centers around hayworth deciding about a career choice. along the way, we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending. all in all, an unmemorable film, except as a showcase for hayworth's beauty.

this is the most boring, pretentious, and stupid film i have seen in a long time. i saw it at the academy in beverly hills, and there were quite a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and were seeking refuge there. all were solemnly shaking their heads and looking as though they had been to a funeral. what a waste of time and money. even worse are the critics who gave this pretentious blimp good reviews. what's with them? are they just afraid they won't be considered "hip"? were they bribed? this film is staggeringly bad. don't take a date to it expecting to have an in-depth chat at the cheesecake factory afterwards. if going to see this film was your idea, she'll browbeat you and hold it over you the rest of your life.

'northfork' is what is wrong with indie films. for all of their hard-edged commentary and attacking big subjects studios won't, this is the sacrifice we make. for nearly two hours i was subjected to the torture and pain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully dies.there are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy. two men dressed in black (one of them james woods) must coerce the remaining inhabitants of northfork to leave before a dam opens up and floods the town. the other story has a boy returned to the priest (nick nolte) that gave him to the parents. he is dying and is visited, i guess, by angels. among them anthony edwards with bizarre spectacles and daryl hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from seinfeld.though this is the "plot," it is not what the film is about. the film is about nothing. it does nothing, says nothing, goes nowhere, and has nothing interesting to show. perhaps by design, more likely an after-effect of the pretentious, surreal, david lynch wannabe - we're an important artsy film can't you see - style of direction. the entire movie is filtered through a gray, bleak backdrop that, i suppose, fits a film about death. instead, it simply makes the film that much harder to watch.if you want to see a film about men in black, see either 'men in black' films, neither too impressive but compared to 'northfork' they are lifted to 'citizen kane' status. if you want to see a film about a boy dying watch 'lorenzo's oil.' if you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch 'o brother, where art thou?' if you want to watch a film better than 'northfork,' there are hundreds. if you want to watch a film that is worse, there are only a handful. 0* out of ****

pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique: 1) throw opaque, unstructured threads around to perplex the audience. 2) deal only in `big' topics such as life, death and god. 3) make it appear profound with scenes of life, death, sky, etc. 4) depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) and finally, laugh all the way to critical acclaim.this movie is pretentious faux-intellectualism at its boldest. not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions, they're afraid to pose the questions to begin with. the film is held together by wisps. directions are raised and dropped awkwardly. pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary. there is so little to point at, that any critical stabs will miss.critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this movie is about. good news: neither do the filmmakers. satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit, intellect, poetry, and genius. sadly, this movie demonstrates none of these traits.

"what symbolism!" exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the polish brother's paean to ingmar bergman. some symbolism is there all right. but not much. "northfork" adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls.northfork is a town facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam goes into operation. it's the early to middle 1950s and a squad of identically dressed state agents, all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for "the untouchables," have the job of relocating recalcitrant dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving. an exciting anti-development movie is always a possibility but let's get real: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in american history. dams can be built without forced relocation? not in this country.but this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boy's escapist imagination. nick nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear.alternating between the black-suited evacuation agents (working for "lakefront" land when the dam creates that valuable acreage) and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos, the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly. the cinematography is poor. a washed out, subdued and depressive color permeates the whole film to little dramatic purpose. there is no reason for this vast terrain to be depicted so bleakly. indeed, a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective.4/10.

the frustrating thing about a movie like this, with a true potential for greatness, is that it almost enjoys being heavy-handed. we speak of allegory, of metaphor...but the truth is, there's no getting around the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character.at a certain point, we most know who the people are...even if we never understand where they are going. the sheer pretentiousness wore me down every time i tried to grasp a truth in this film.call it beautiful, great and awesome...i just call it "cheating." all style and no substance. sure, it's a matter of taste...but i would never take a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes over the spiritual clarity of jean cocteau or renoir. but if it works for you, i'm all for it. art is a personal thing, i guess.

i tried to be patient and open-minded but found myself in a coma-like state. i wish i would have brought my duck and goose feather pillow...i apologize to all of the great actors in this movie. maybe it takes a degree from mit to understand the importance of this movie.

if this movie had a point i never discovered it. a very depressing movie which supposedly is about the final evacuation of the residents living in a dam site area on the northfork river in montana. the problem is that there is no actual northfork river in montana. there are several north forks but they are branches of other rivers which divided into north and south forks.	the opening scene of the movie is a coffin bobbing to the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied into the story and the viewer is left to speculate as to its meaning. but much is left to the viewer's speculation in the movie. another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for the evacuation of the residents arrives at the dam headquarters, another group of people are departing. some remark which is almost inaudible is made about these people which makes no sense whatsoever and there is no followup in the movie to explain it.	the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting. and the stories are weird. in one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like noah's ark.	another senseless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time. if anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained it to them.	the scenery was stark and the sun never shines. there are snowy mountains in the far distance. i guess the purpose was to set the mood. the time period is set by the fact that the evacuaters all drove ford sedans of the 1946-48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955. the acting was mediocre. when i saw the billing for this movie it said that darryl hannah was in the picture. if she was, i didn't recognize her but i surmise that she was the ghost lady.

this is one of the best looking films of the past few years. the fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring ($1.8 million or so they say on the dvd:they infer that they ended up with even less financing) makes it all the more impressive. not simply the photography, but the design and particularly the locations (eastern montana) which are at once authentically american and otherworldly.too bad there isn't a coherent movie to go with it. an extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to angels and a dying child. and what is presented as the "real world" is hopelessly arch. note to the polish brothers:the coen brothers are funny-you are not.no doubt many cineastes will find "northfork"'s abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity, the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch "charlie's angels" or something. (sigh) if you insist....in the meantime, recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty.

there is nothing i hate more in a movie than pretentiousness, and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made. it's self-consciousness is obvious in every frame: "see what a profound, sophisticated film we are making," the director and screenwriters seem to be saying to us, and to themselves they say, "lets's see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more." i would rather watch the worst film by ed wood or edgar g. ulmer than something like this. at least they were giving us honest trash, and at least their films, in their own atrocious way, were entertaining. this film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia, and thus is tantamount to torture.have these screenwriters ever heard the word 'story?' it doesn't appear so. they have a concept, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and elicit good performances from them. and for what? to bore us for an hour and 45 minutes? nothing really happens in this film. the only exciting part, and this lasts only about two minutes, occurs when one of the soon-to-be-evicted homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave. but nothing comes of it. too bad he didn't keep shooting until he hit the screenwriters. the only redeeming features of this film are the acting and some beautifully photographed scenery toward the end. 3/10

most of the films i really like are art-house fare and seldom appear on the box-office top-ten lists. that said, i found "northfork" utterly incomprehensible. i have no idea what it was even about. writing in the new york times about a different film, stephen holden once observed that some people seem to think they can throw just anything up on the screen and have it work as a fairy tale. i thought of that review several times while watching "northfork".on a scale of one to ten, i gave it a two.

a professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried. the quality cast, stark setting and excellent cinemetography made you hope for fargo or high plains drifter but sorry, the soup had no seasoning...or meat for that matter. a 3 (of 10) for effort.

keys to the vip is just another one of the horrible t.v. shows that you can and will see on this station. the show is terrible with guys claiming to be real players competing against each other (there are two of them competing in each episode) in stupid games where they try to get girls at a bar to talk to them, get girls numbers, and so on. the judges are four other guys who also claim to be expert pick up artists but they also seem like just huge d-bags just like the contestants. the show is not funny at all and not even interesting, it is just boring watching these guys desperately try to convince us what awesome players they are (talking even more about the four judges than i am about the contestants). nothing funny has even happened in the shows i have watched and the shows are obviously rigged. do you really think they have invited all these people to the club, got them to sign releases, and get them on tape while these guys carry out the same stupid games with them? it's not reality at all it is just stupid, it probably even tapes in the day time. somebody else on here wrote how they knew somebody on the show and it was all fake well yeah that is obvious, it's a fake show and even with actors it's still not funny. one of the worst shows i have ever seen.

this show is pathetic. i can't even begin to imagine how anyone with an iq greater than that of a can of split pea soup that's past its expiration date can willingly sit through this garbage for an entire half hour. it is one of those rare shows that is so mind-numbingly awful in every respect you can honestly say you are less intelligent simply from watching it. i conducted a study and found that the average person loses 10 iq points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show. that is second only to another comedy network abortion, popcultured (19,863,221 iq points per second lost) and pretty much a tie with girls will be girls. keys to the vip owes each and every one of us an apology. whenever i watch this travesty of a show, i feel sad for society. how is it allowed to continue?

this show just sucks. i don't think i even need to say it or why because judging by the number of comments already i am just repeating everything. keys to the vip is like turning on your tv and having it throw poo at you. that is exactly what it is like i am not even exaggerating even a little bit. these guys are so stupid, not funny and not smooth with the ladies that it's not even funny-casue-its-stupid. i sat through four episodes and i want my two hours back. where do they find the contestants because they are obviously deficient mentally. if i was the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on tv i would do the world a favour and jump off the tallest building i could find. how does garbage like this get on tv? especially the comedy network shouldn't a show on something called the comedy network at least be a comedy show or maybe be funny so often?

after having seen this show a few times; i am thoroughly offended as a female that there are so many stupid, women out there that fall for this bullshit. im a little more mature than some of the "players" in this show, but am still appalled that the whole dating game has been boiled down to a gameshow: where goofy dudes can score points on their lame ass attempts to pick up chicks. if young guys are watching this and using it as a learning manual: don't!!!. save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you are after is a piece of ass. maybe there are girls out there with the same mind set;but some how i don't think so.

1) men over the age of 25 that refer to themselves, without irony, as having "game", or being either a "player" or a "baller". gentlemen, from here on in it's a swift descent into starring in your own real-life version of "a night at the roxbury". 2) saying "the v.i.p." the term "v.i.p." in and of itself isn't bad, but when preceded by "the" it instantly becomes part of the douchebag dictionary. this goes double for white people. 3) people that make tv shows based on stuff that they don't know isn't cool and then go on imdb posing as "fans", (...right...) moreover, one of whom is from the "united states" (hey, me too!) to bitterly insult members of their potential audience for inevitably thinking their show sucks. minus 1 additional demerit point if they employ any variation on the oh-snap-nice-one-bro justification that "if you don't like the show you obviously can't get laid." 4) canadian hip-hop/r&b sensation massari...a random addition to the list at first glance, but at the end of the day massari gets the gas face for the simple reason that his particular brand of low-rent american-aping uncool and general aqua velva douchebaggery dovetails with the overall sensibility of "keys to the v.i.p." 5) last but not least, "keys to the v.i.p."...for all the above reasons and more.

it's too bad these guys, the so-called judges, are such jerks, even the nominally "sensitive" ones. it's the self-congratulatory tone that really makes me sick though; these guys don't have any perspective on their behaviour. i think the real problem, though, is the quality of the contestants. not a single smooth or truly charming one in the lot. they pick the most pathetic girls out of the crowd because they're the only ones these guys have a chance with. let's see some real players trying for a truly unattainable girl, and maybe you have a show. otherwise, you have a revolting half-hour of self-love. and real sexual tension takes two.

yeah..that's what the station disclaimer states after the commercials for this show "some scenes may be disturbing to some viewers" .it is beyond disturbing. the validation of this whole display of ego framing and chauvinism is in the fact it is on the comedy channel. yes..a comedy true and true. a joke. to see these 'playas' go through their rigid charade really spells out what is wrong with society. especially the meat market bar scene. both sides, the male and female, are equally as weak and desperate to be mingling among this superficial atmosphere. the club is obviously one of those cigarette corporation sponsored plastic coke scenes. these people do have a choice, and that is what makes it even more of a joke. these slick ricks try too hard. they glisten with their own groove grease. that's ok. it's a lesson on video tape for the new generation of how not to focus on a potential heart interest. hopefully that facade will crumble along with the bush/harper administrations. problem is, who's lined up after these characters fade? the bastard children of the one night stands?

it hurt to watch this movie, it really did... i wanted to like it, even going in. shot obviously for very little cash, i looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. unfortunately, although i did appreciate the film on that level, the acting and editing was terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory. a 95 minute film should not drag. the ratings for this one are good so far, but i fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one. what was with those transitions? dear mr. editor, did you just purchase your first copy of adobe premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? anyway... some better actors, a little more passion, and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie.

it's been said that some directors make small budget pictures look like blockbusters. albert pyun makes small budget pictures look like high school a/v project films. this film was pretty much lacking in all departments. practically every scene drags on excessively, the "experimental" lighting and camera work is terrible, rob lowe apparently equated being scruffy with acting, and the poor drab euro-pop numbers stop the movie to a dead halt. on the plus side, burt reynolds does a pretty good job with what he's given (which isn't much), mario van peebles is surprisingly decent and ice-t puts in another of a long recent string of b-movie gangsters. not pyun's worst work (urban menace), but certainly not his best (mean guns).

do not watch this movie, or.. if you are really mad at anyone, you can give this as a birthdaypresent. this is the worst movies i have ever seen. do not watch this. if you do, remember: that would be a self-destructive action. it is a shame that this is not voted lower.

i saw this movie a time ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and i got voted down.. i tried as best i could to get the story, because some moviemag had said that this would be a movie that would be for rob lowe, that pulp fiction had been for john travolta... well.. we can all see that he not only failed, but he fell aaall the way down. this is actually the worst film i've ever seen, and i've seen a great deal of bad movies.. it's just not even worth seeing for free on tv.

crazy six is torture, it must be albert pyun´s worst film. even blast and ticker are better! i can´t believe how boring this film is! how this even got greenlighted? i saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing i remember is how bad it was. this isn´t good bad movie, it is simply bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie.1 out of 10 (½ out of *****)

the worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast forwarded it to burt's bits and then the end!!! he is the only reason to watch this!! i have to admit to owning a copy as i am a huge burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie!! there are just no redeeming qualities about this movie!!! absolutely nothing what so ever to like about this movie!!! this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate burt's worst!! rob lowe's worst worst hour and a half of my life

i'm actually too drained to write this review -- bad movies always do that to me -- but i feel obligated, as if it's my civic duty, to warn anyone who might be considering purchasing or viewing this god-awful mess-of-a-picture. please, please, just take my word: this is one you'll want to stay away from. it's so boring and dull, so insipid and uninspired, such a poor excuse to assemble any familiar talent. burt reynolds? wasted (despite his best efforts). ice-t is barely in the film, and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by ice's intense stare, didn't know what to do with him. rob lowe, as the title character, has never displayed so little on-screen charisma. mario van peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance is, in the saddest sense possible, a joke. surely, satan himself signed mario's check for this film. the plot is as weak, half-baked and annoying as all the music involved (the utterly boring club song seems to continue on, literally, for the first third of the movie). the film's look will prompt one to seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced, like one of the film's forgettable female characters, to smoke crack from a pipe duct-taped to his mouth. and if you're looking, at least, for stylized, shoot-'em-up-type violence you'll get none here. this film, i assure you, i promise you, has absolutely no redeeming qualities! please, i implore you, avoid this flick! don't put it in and get suckered into believing that its pace will pick up, it'll get better, and evolve into a decent denouement. it won't. it don't. it can't! it sucks! now, you have been warned, and i can now go to bed (it's 3am - please forgive any resulting errors this admonition might contain) -- knowing my conscience is clear, because i've done my civic duty for my fellow man!

yeah, that's right. if i were to ask my friends this question: "what's the worst movie you have ever seen?" they might reply something like "armageddon" (can you drill the hole?!?), "shriek", "plan nine from outer space", "the medallion", "scooby doo" etc... no - don't get offended by this by thinking you have seen something that might be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer that this movie is in. if the worst movie you can think of is, let's say so bad it really pisses you off; then you know nothing my friend.crazy six... i remember the day me and a buddy of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie. both of us had already been through most of the movies in there, and on the "new movies"-shelf we see it staring at us. "wow, there's some good actors here man. says something about mafia, lets just get it and get out of here". this was without doubt the worst movie mistake in my movie loving life. it was also the worst mistake for everybody else: movie lover or not.watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water (or ice-tea....) until it reaches room temperature. watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death, if death is just blackout light and nothing, and then you realize you are just staring at your tv-monitor. not staring. you are actually paying as much attention that is humanly possible. this is no joke.this movie is the perfection of making a bad movie. it's not the kind of bad you can watch, point and laugh of, its the kind of movie that is so bad you actually have no chance of ever get out of your memory. unless perhaps you use electric shock therapy to clear out the brain. .... ... (hey! that might be something similar to how i remember me and my buddy felt after watching it....)best regards from me to you albert pyun.-joergen

do not rent this movie. i ended up buying the "previously viewed" tape of this for $4.00. that was close to the price of a rental, so thought, i might as well buy it. i'm tossing it out after i finish this review. the movie which stars lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow moving shots and poorly done editing. i thought i'd be seeing a mindless action flick, which is what i wanted to see, i didn't even get that. this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no script, close-ups, terrible edited, and a poorly developed plot. i can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. by the end of the movie, we still don't even really know who they are. believe the hype, stay away.

crazy director....yeah, you need to be crazy to make a near movie. rob lowe was bad in his character, ice-t is always bad and burt reynolds had nothing to do in the movie. crazy six is an unknown movie, with some known actors...this is pretty weird. a bad movie with some good actors in it. it looks like the bad movie did an influence to their performance...it did! crazy people.....i give it *and a half out of *****

honestly, i didn't really have high expectations for this movie, but at the same time i was hopeful. having it be directing by albert pyun - one of the more well known b-movie auteur's - didn't exactly raise my hopes. i mean how many albert pyun flicks rank that highly? yeah, exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast. rob lowe, burt reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), ice-t and mario van peebles.it all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on. it runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat. i don't know what pyun was going for here. i mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a blur at times and maybe i'm an idiot for expecting more from pyun this time around. here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. crazy six isn't much of an action film, it's not much of anything really.i guess what's the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie. the music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female vocals too, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better. avoid.

this is the worst movie ive ever seen. and i have seen lots of movies. me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening. man we had lots of fun. this movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. but it makes you laugh! u will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air. you wonder why? just rent it and check for the keyboard playing girl at that sleazy russian bar. my mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her feedin the cats.

i bought this movie for about 2,5 dollars at a local flea market. i thought that with the cast present in this movie (ice-t, rob lowe & mario van peebles are all ok), it would be pretty good. boy, was i wrong. this movie annoyed the hell out of me. almost every scene drags on too long. the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie. the rest is no picknick either. my guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last 3x longer.conclusion: the current 1,9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. go watch some paint dry for 1,5 hour instead of watching this!if you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'mean guns'(with christopher lambert & ice-t) or 'postmortem' (with charlie sheen) instead.

the story overall, though quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. however, the movie was absolutely dreadful. the story was good, but the acting was terrible. i was crying the whole time because i knew i could never get my spent time back. don't see this movie. if you do, bring a pistol with a bullet in it, and a few bullets if you're going with friends. i feel sorry for everybody who had anything to do with this film. i also feel sorry for everybody who had to watch the film. avoid this film at all costs, and if your mother forces you to watch, kill her. hahahahaha! see! i'm a psycho now!!!! ikwtcbs turned me into a psycho!!!!

i had to read i know why the caged birds sing in my english class and we watched the movie after finishing it. after watching the movie, i regret seeing. it completely took away any of the impact the book had. the scenes made no sense in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed as though the screen writer never actually picked up the book but opted for the cliff notes instead. i was outraged at how the movie ended. almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to maya's growth as a person. if you have read ...caged birds, this movie will ruin the experience of the book so i warn you not to see it.

a ridiculous movie, a terrible editing job, worst screenplay, ridiculous acting, a story that is completely ununderstandable...if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done, judging by this one, the entire world movie industry would now be dead...a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who "think" they can make movies.i am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour, and are never introduced to us...

you would probably get something like this. i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence. of course, there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break, but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art. but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap". to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, i can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much. i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art movie) to portray a slavic woman as a half-articulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three-legged stool.

first, i don't see how the movie is on any "best" list or how it won any awards. compared to la pianiste, which is also on a "best" list, la pianiste is gold. this movie lacked so many things, on so many different levels, but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much. the lead actor was annoying, i felt as though i never knew what was going on, and i was bored!! even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting, i wanted it to end.... as soon as possible. why did it have to be his sister and cousin? ugh. and why did thibault get mean? he just bipolarly turned mean. and also, was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about? who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse? why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in? i mean this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in french culture? european culture? i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that!

french cinema sucks! down with all these psychiotric visions with their my-god-am-i-cultivated distinguished attitudes! pestilence to conceited symbolic film-language and impervious chiffres! i'll no longer have a mind for that! léos carax, did you ever think about, that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid??? maybe i'm too common to understand you? or had it been your task to confirm all the clichés of a frenchman the world can have? guillaume the to-be-guilliotined comes to his home-palace, mme. deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "here am i, darling!" in this moment, i knew, that she's in the bathtub, and we`ll see her lying in there soon. don't misunderstand me, i'm not prudish, and the incestous sex scene was the climax of the film. but this is, in berlin, we say "etepetete", what means something like "être-peut-être", a snobistic, self-satisfied, and, the worst, seen that often in french movies i can tell! other example: she, beautiful and willing, is looking at herself in a mirror, combing her hair, and her wild-bearded, dirty young guru rushs into the room, breathless shouting: "there's no escape, there's no escape!" forty years after existencialistic sartres and consorts- what's new, what's exciting about? my god, there's that woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? and when you're not, please explain much better, why!! born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza, no escape, is that the point?

the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub. she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal. the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.

i'm accustomed to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off. but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation...."last year at marienbad" comes to mind. well, "pola x" ain't no "last year at marienbad". i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years. "pola x" achieved membership in that august group. in my defense, i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground - hoping things would turn around. however, i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances. "pola x" does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work. after a 10 year hiatus, that must have been bitter for him indeed. melville is still spinning in his grave!

pretentious claptrap, updating herman melville (!), about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long-lost sister who has been raised by gypsies. or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi-layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (the siblings swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death, the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings). considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve (who at least gets to bathe in the nude), i was expecting a lot more from this one; apparently, there's an even longer tv version of pola x out there

it's difficult to express how bad this movie is. even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the smug middle-class mores of both the usa and western europe, this movie would have been a stinker. the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if that's the correct latin grammar); the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics (by the male lead as well as the females); the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's (or somebody's) breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial; the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie -- i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic. the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot -- but underneath his clothes, this king has no substance.

i enjoyed carax's "les amants du pont neuf" and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard. well, the first 10 minutes were ok, but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life. a sad disappointment.

i won't lie, i rented this film because it was an "arty" film with some possible explicit sex. i got that scene and catherine deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like "did i have a mother or father, i don't know" (paraphrased). usually delivered in long soliloquies.if you are curious about the transition of "art" to porn, might be an interesting look, with use of the fast forward button (i was still too slow!)

(spoilers)oh sure it's based on moby dick. totally obsessed and it destroy's him. it's a total folly. the movie starts off rather well, but by the end of the film, everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank.the supposed half sister is never convincing. some very poor lighting effects. music is interesting. but little else. it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing. i suppose if you like being john malkovich, you might like this. but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again, pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell. the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either.)this movie is severely boring, depressing, and poorly directed. not highly recommended. if if you like french movies. (go watch crimson rivers instead)4/10quality: 5/10 entertainment: 1/10 replayable: 0/10

this movie is so unreal. french movies like these are just waste of time. why watch this movie? even, i did not know..why. what? the well known sex scene of half-siblings? although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story it is based upon is so unreal. what is the use of it, then? can you find easily in life, half sibling doing such things?did i learn something from this movie? yeah: some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies, such stories, such non-sense. but for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply a life without hope, then there you are.. you've got to see this movie.only one worth adoring, though: catherine deneuve. she's such a strikingly beautiful woman.

i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success. at least he'd have wound up with something.the film struck me as pointless, rambling, and very stylish, like some other recent french films. not to knock it. most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever. we should be grateful, i suppose, for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind-blown continental winter, and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up.but there can be too much of a good thing. golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night, carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such. (there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. you'll love it if you're vlad the impaler.) lots of people die. catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle. i don't know why. golubeva's young girl dies too, and i don't know why she dies either. she gets slapped in the face, falls to the pavement, and dies.there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too. i'll have to take their word for it because, although it is stylishly photographed, it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. don't worry about the kiddies being shocked. they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway.depardieu isn't a bad actor. as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man -- well, handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way -- to a limping, murderous, hairy physical wreck, we feel sorry for the guy. golubeva has a wan pretty face, with enormous half-lidded eyes and wide cheeks, like a doll. her next movie should be a remake of lewton's "i walked with a zombie." then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. i guess it's a band. as far as i could make out, the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of "easy listening" might not enjoy it. if you don't like the music, there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieu's walking stick.i must say, i found it barely worth sitting through. (and it's a longie, too.) at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by, sometimes stopping entirely. i wish it had had a few jokes.

this film seems well made, and more efforts should be made to promote films by women. that aside, this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed. if you've seen any of the promotional material, you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end, but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:a woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship. when told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is, tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that "life's not fair."huh??? this character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying, and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him "this isn't sex."reverse the genders, have the leads played by tracey gold and brian austin-green and this could air in feature length on lifetime with a title like "hostage to obsession." there is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass tessa's behavior in this film.props to kristen thomson for playing a border-line psychotic, manipulative ex to a t, perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person, male or female, who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine.

sorry, but jacqueline hyde (get it??? - jack l and hyde - jekyll & hyde) has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn, not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with undiagnosed learning disabilities.jackie hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had. guess who? yes, an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over one's body and mind - yes, that mr. hyde! despite some nice skin scenes, this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughter.as much as poor jackie tries she just can't stay away from granddaddy's special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time.

jack frost 2 was a horrible, terrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie. the original, was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. and the snowman went around murdering people, and avoiding blow dryers like the plague. this, however, was a far cry from the quality of the original. it seems like this even had a lower-budget because for some reason, after an hour into this film, i still hadn't seen the snowman. some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice-over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character. disappointing to no belief, even for a fan of bad cinema.

-may contain spoilers-clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. i just can't see it any other way. what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.anyhow, where to begin. the bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than george w. bush's college career. i don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack frosts' were getting killed. also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. "how do we know it's him?" like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! a great camp film, but a very bad film overall.

this movie sucks. did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms. there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else. this movie blows hard, painful to sit through too. stay far away.

yes, in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make. it has its funny moments, but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me. you can not come up with a good story, your effects are going to really be bad, hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie. the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort. it also had better effects too, this one is just a step or two ahead of "hobgoblins" as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets. still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost. actually, i am just kidding, but really it was the funniest part of the movie.

ill-conceived sequel(..the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules(..it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept).i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists, but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting. anyway, the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival(..i mean seriously, why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).the "snow anvil" murder scene takes the cake. ice icicles protrude from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them. oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie..such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone("oh, it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!")or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. jack frost has the power to freeze water(..then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow. one sequence has jack freezing pool water, encasing a swimming model under the sheet, result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.oh, there's also a recreation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit from the christmas story("cowatonga dude!").i gotta hand it to the cast, though..they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining. christopher allport(..perhaps unwisely)returns as sam, to face his old nemesis, as does eileen seeley, as his wife. the attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor(..for me, at least) fell flat, but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the introduced foreign elements, allow him to withstand coolant/anti-freeze, and, even worse, he now can reproduce..through indigestion, jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans, but i personally found this junk rather hokey(..that's the purpose behind it, i suppose, cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable.the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort. the weapon against them..bananas! it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film, both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze(..an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed, and i guess in their being "being linked" by the icicle, jack inherited sam's banana allergy, or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both "merged" in a sense.phew, such a film as this defies simple explanation. it's a film with effects and plot so terrible, one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings.

having already seen the original "jack frost", i never thought that "jack frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. boy was i wrong! then again, a-pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. i believe this is the first a-pix sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more a-pix sequels.it's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. they are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which i have to say looks very cheesy. the computer animation surprised me, as the first "jack frost" had no such effects.i'd strongly recommend that you see the original "jack frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).now only if there was "uncle sam 2"...

the poet carne disappears (didn´t he disappeared with prévert?) and is followed by the judge carne. the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesn´t understand and he doesn´t want to. it´s a long way from the wonderful "les enfants du paradis"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this episode had potential. the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. and when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.first of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. "it's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;" "this door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago;" "the door opened by itself, without me touching it;" etc.). given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn't she take some precaution before entering it? maybe she could investigate in the day time. or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. or maybe she could turn on the lights!!! also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. just unplug the phone! the phone company doesn't need to be involved. walk up to the phone and unplug it. case closed.finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical. if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony. brave little toaster anyone?

although i could sum this pathetic episode of night gallery in two words, those two words being "horse manure," i am obligated to write a minimum of ten lines. this is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of rod serling, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy. the premise of giant rodents inhabiting the moon, a lifeless orb to be sure, is totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. i suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. i can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes first aired on that date. all in all, a waste of film, actors and air time.

this "space snippet" was kind of dumb. i guess it was supposed to be a shocker unexpected ending, but imho it was just a huge letdown. joseph campanella and the rest of the earthbound actors do a great job in this one; their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though. how this ending could ever have made it through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me. the other comment on here is not correct, the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season, this thing was supposed to be taken seriously! the producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice.

okay, so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct mm2 and mm3, i thought, heck, i got to check out monster man and see what its like, maybe i can get a part in it, but when i popped it into my dvd player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad i mean horribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass thinking he's funny, not to mention how looooong the director spent on the pointless desert road trip, i cam to the conclusion that these guys didn't have a clue of what they were doing and missed the boat by a long shot. the story had potential to be somewhat different than the usual bs you see on the blockbuster/hollywood video shelf put out by lions gate these days, but they surely messed this one up. why put so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad acting and bad jokes, why not shorten the road trip and put more of the plot in the movie. myabe the writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore, that they had to find filler to make the usual 84 minutes???? all in all, and i'm being easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that gets his skull crushed when chasing the three leads out into the street, i will give it at least 1 star for trying, and the gore/kill scenes weren't that bad, again, they tried. too bad, lions gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea, but failed. i don't recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene. crap!

what an absolute joke of a movie. the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets jeepers creepers meets texas chainsaw massacre. three good films in their own right and you would think, using their blueprint, mm couldn't go far wrong. well that's what i thought, and i was very, very mistaken! we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding. they pick up a girl (no she doesn't get her clothes off), then they get chased by a leatherface rip-off in a monster truck, whom they aptly name f**kface (aka monster man).the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle, but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin it's potential.so mm decides he's got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit, they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with hitch-hiker sarah (though they both wear underwear!). then they are caught by mm, taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill mm, but fail, hence the set-up for the sequel. apart from a minor 'twist', that's it.if you can get past the first 2 minutes  where adam's friend harley pops up from hiding in the back of adam's car to try to scare him, with no explanation as to how harley even got there, how long ago or how adam even failed to realise  without thinking you hate it already, then you may just enjoy this film.monster man has very poor cinematography and direction which is immediately off-putting. this is the kind of movie that you'll be able to pick up as one of those films in a box set of 20 horror movies that you've never heard of.what is so irritating is blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality films that are shot on digital by some amateur film students, and that's exactly what mm is (though imdb states this particular director was born in 1961).the acting throughout this film is atrocious. the script, which the writer obviously considered to be funny, is irritating and childish. you get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting. in fact, the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised, full of those boring, un-entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved. imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation, sure, points are funny  to you, but mostly it's trash. that's what the script for mm is like.don't watch it for the gore either  it's fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there (bad taste, evil dead et al) jeepers creepers 1 & 2, even with their cheesiness and plot holes, are far superior to this film. compare the intro of jeepers creepers to the intro of monster man and you'll see what i mean.

now don't get me wrong i love bad movies... no i adore bad movies, troll 2.... ouch painful, manos the hands of fate... just watch torgo go, guru the mad monk.. is that traffic noise in the medieval background? ok so that's clear, but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better, but didn't make it. why not? well it would be easy to blame the plot, but heh we've seen worse, there weren't too many holes and heh i know there's not a lot of originality in it but then that needn't kill a film. the effects aren't bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is ok, the truck quite menacing so where did it go wrong? well i'd love to blame it on the 'chris moyles' look-a-like harley... so i will! comedy and horror are difficult to mix well, bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem. i loathed this guy from the moment he stuck his head up (literally), the continual bating of the overly meek adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose belief that the mildest of people wouldn't react by pushing him out of the moving car door... and i thought it was the monster bits that the director was meant to have trouble convincing us of. why are bad movies fun? well you have great fun poking holes in them, laughing at the script, all the howlers etc. this film doesn't make the coveted category of 'worst movies' because its just bad due to being annoying nuff said. don't bother, go watch anything else and you'll be a better person for it... i promise! (fade to chants of torgo torgo torgo)

wow, where do i begin? after suffering through this wretched $1.00 rental (thanks a lot, family video) i just had to make a few comments. i did not bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film, but hopefully you will know who i am talking about.a monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two college-aged buddies to their doom. they encounter a hot girl wearing slutty clothes. i mean, this just sounds fantastic in theory. i was laughing hysterically at the dvd box while i walked it up to the girl behind the counter at the video store.acting: the hot girl, played by aimee whatever, is visibly laughing through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared. the other two major actors in the film, the fat prankster and the vanilla straight-guy are both terrible. the fat guy thinks he's jack black. he's not. the other actor, our hero, over-emotes and misses all his cues and comes across as some generic character you might see in a made-for-nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90's. look: i don't expect great performances in movies like these, but at least the actors can make an effort to not be annoying. you can be an incompetent actor but still be agreeable (i.e. john wayne). at least that aimee gal is attractive.script: holy ****, who thought this dialogue was funny? i wouldn't have the nerve to play this out in front of my grade school drama class, much less pitch it as a film script. unfathomably bad. more on this later.production: ok, this is the one place where the film definitely succeeds. production quality is amazingly high. the look of the film is very good. apparently the only talented person who worked on the movie was the director of photography.ok, here are my biggest gripes: 1) the guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles an hour.2) the guy driving the car is well out into the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat. he is supposedly meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition but he does not notice a 300lb jack black impersonator in the back? come on.4) characters never change their clothes. there are two hotel scenes. presumably, showers are available to our characters yet over the 3 days this movie takes place, none of the characters bothers to change their clothes.5) comedy. lighthearted, slapstick comedy does not mix with horror. period. you can't have our characters running away from a monster truck one second and the next second have them verbally jousting one another with some dopey light/comedy music playing. this kind of pacing virtually ruins any tension in the movie. movies like evil dead 2 which mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be loosened yet never completely eliminated with humor. monster man doesn't get it.i'm irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot more clever than he really was. oh well.

heard some good remarks about this film as being very gory and frightning, but it's neither. obviously the screenwriter wanted to do a scary horror film but at the same time inject some teenage comedy for the young target audience. scares and comedy seldomly result in good films, the same goes for monster man.not really funny, nor scary or overly enjoyable on any other level.aproaching 39 years of age i've seen my share of horror movies. i have seen good ones and terrible ones, but the crop of films released these days are so frighteningly mediocre it bores me to watch 'em. the acceptance these days for bad films like this is what really annoys me. let's face it, they produced a lot of crap in the 70's, 80's and 90's but they were regarded as such then as well. today they're regarded as "good entertainment". - bollocks!

last night, i am sitting in my tv room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the tv tray & i decide to put the movie "monster man" into my trusty vcr. expecting a fun-filled, gory, crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. what do i get instead? one of the most silly, stupid, unfrightening & predictable films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. and what's even worse, all during the(& i use this next phrase loosely) "sex scene" the girl keeps all her clothes on! i'll make this summary short & sweet: mix "dude where's my car" (about a good 1/2 of the film) with a very watered down "hitcher", add a redneck version of the antagonist from "i madman" as the primary villain & finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo & you'll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is. it's also utterly predictable throughout. the only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a "horror film" is that some of the moments between the 2 guys (even though the "hero" is one major annoying geek & the other is a jack black clone) are kind of funny (just mediocre funny i.e..like most of snl skits). other than that, "monster man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (this one i'll be handing out at halloween time-just hope after the person views it i don't get my house egged or worse)

i would like to know who conned the producers of this movie to pay for its production - that persion is a genius of sorts. this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast. i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on, but nothing really was. it was not scary. the dialog was poorly written. the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episode.at this point i'm just mad that i wasted all that time. that's a couple hours that i will never get back.i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening. take a nap or hit the gym instead. or if you want to be scared, turn on a cable news channel.

i completely disagree with the previous reviewer: this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot. (unless you really think sipping from a septic tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot) in fact, the only reasons i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a.) two of the actors are decent b.)the soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in for contrast and c.)the monster truck is pretty terrifying.other than that, this is a movie with some intermittent, creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by unrelenting crassness, crudity and vileness. the former best friend character is one of the most annoying i've ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at all.a waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the hitchhiking character...

fans of horror comedy will like this one. others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off. it's sort of a buddy film, with over-the-top violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters, and a lot of craziness.it looks to have been made on a budget of about $100, by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party. there's a lead who's a frustrated nerd, and his loudmouth prank-pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second. there's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the film. whenever this thing and its gnarly-mask wearing driver appear, it's a great scene. there's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat, and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars. the nerd's friend never shuts his yap, and gets them in one mess after another. their arguing got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film make up for it.sight gags poking fun at several "psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody" films are everywhere. take your pick which one is riffed the most: hills have eyes, saw, and jeepers creepers were some that i recognized.it's enjoyable insanity, if you're in the right frame of mind. sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun; it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together.

some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour, but when a film comes along that isn't as original as the "classics" but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po-faced, wanna-be critics completely slag it off. this film made me laugh aloud several times, this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows. the two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film. you root for them the whole way and laugh along with them, everyone has friends like both of these guys. another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's awesome, intimidating and really well shot. taking inspiration (completely stealing) from loads of films, the most obvious being duel, jeepers creepers and probably in reference to the jack black alike co-star orange county. but really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here. but so what, it's not trying to win any oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score it's a 10! obviously it's not getting a 10, i give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99% of the people on imdb. there is no-way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ain't getting a 10 either. it's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares. you really can't get anymore simple than that.

this dvd is barely 30 minutes long, and has dull interviews that reveal that the average slipknotian has an iq of around 30. but these aspects are the least problematic here.the real trouble is that slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100,000 units of their crap. (the only reason i say "one of the" instead of "the" is because system of a down are even worse.) much like ed gein's girlfriends, this band's music is pieced together from age-old metal clichés, which are to be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. in fact, their image is kind of fun; their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment.their music, however, consists of nothing of quality - whatsoever: just a bunch of gimmicky, heard-them-a-million-times-before played-solely-at-the-guitar-neck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form "songs" that have no cohesion, no highlights, no nothing. but if the riffs are truly bad, then the vocals are even worse: slipknot's singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting "evil" growl - the kind 90% of all metal bands today have - but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing! still, what could one expect? rule no.39 of the "nu metal" handbook says quite clearly: "you will alternately growl and sing. ignore the fact that the two styles don't mix well, because most of your fans are so tone-deaf they will love you even if you **** into the microphone." slipknot are at their absolute worst when their "singer" starts belching out "melodies".but back to their image. it's stolen, copied, ripped off, nicked, borrowed, taken without asking from none other than mr.bungle. you've never heard of them? of course you haven't. you only listen to nu-metal, and mr.bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. they too wore masks - grotesque, horror ones, similar to those of slipknot, i might add - in the late 80s and early 90s. this band, whose frontman is mike patton from faith no more, never hit it big because their music wasn't directed toward the average music fans (to put it mildly).so, basically slipknot aren't even original in the image department. they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring to the legions of their zit-faced fans, which is when slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music.speaking of mike patton, it's interesting that a number of nu-metal bands often site his singing as a major influence. predictably - and thankfully - patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub-genres ever...having said that, enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye... and then polish those slipknot posters, because in a few years no-one will be taking care of them, the poor dears.having seen corey in the documentary "get thrashed", i finally understand why he wears a mask: he is a blue-eyed baby-faced ginger, looking like dave mustaine's younger brother! not exactly scary.for more of my music-world rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/fedor8/1please punish me hard, very hard, by clicking "no" below. that'll teach me...

here's why this movie fell very short of its potential(i don't read much, so i don't care what the novel was like). 1. i think brendan frasier copied his encino man from lambert's tarzan. it was stiff, and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. they screwed with the story. maybe that's how the book goes, but for as long as i can remember the first utterances of tarzan were "me tarzan, you jane". jane is the first human tarzan encounters. i did like the natives a bit more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. tarzan is primarily a love story. i'm sorry, but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture. that qualifies her for a supporting role at best. supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other, not enough screen time, sorry. not only was andie mcdowell's vioce over pathetic(most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked) the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a whopping 0. i never believed they loved each other, which made the belgian dudes closing voice over, quite frankly, silly. when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an urge, if you will, a feeling he's never felt before. jane brings out the humanity in him, and he brings out the untamed side of her. its this chemistry that compells the story of tarzan. not that lord greystoke's dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him. even a good face lift couldn't help this movie. it needs massive internal reconstruction. oh, and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place. final judgement, 4 out of 10. sorry tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see real acting, drop lambert and check out leonardo dicaprio.

a female friend invited me to see this in the theaters.after half an hour we walked out, and went into the next multiplex (yeah, we broke the rules) in time to catch the beginning of against all odds.i remember too many apes dancing around saying, "oog, oog." very little about the characters or introduction to the story captured either one of us or was even memorable. it just dragged to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend).the production values were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. it seemed like ralph richardson and andie mcdowell were going to be wasted in such a poorly written film.perhaps if you make into the second hour, there is something worth seeing. i do not have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.

i am very interested in animal children and i have read many edger rice burroughs novels -- but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested, nor could i stomach all the absurd, unrealistic scenes. i only managed to sit through the africa part and john's first few days in scotland. let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright silly'! the actors in ape suits looked like extra large chimps, rather than great apes (there is a difference). they did not move with the grace that a wild animal would. (for comparison, see some of the better planet of the apes movies where they trained their actors to move in simian fashion). the apes eat large haunches of meat -- not a common ape practice as far as i know. i am a sucker for animal stories but the script did not make me care about the apes. the great white hunters of the expedition that finds john clayton are charicaturish entirely. the parents of clayton were shipwrecked on an ocean beach, but somehow it is a very long trip down the river to get to the coast -- give me a break! let's talk about 'slow'. even the folks who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie. far from it. it tries to be a character study -- unfortunately the downright silly part predominates! i did not read burroughs' tarzan books, but many of his other series -- they were packed with meaningful action and heroic purpose! this film just isn't there.

this is my opinion of this movie, expressed in its dialogs.to be more serious, i can't say this movie is a bad moment but i didn't enjoy it either. first, i was simply indifferent & couldn't get my mind into the apes world. even though the make-up are very realistic, the constant screaming was irritating. may the film have changed apes for cats and it's a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter.the second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of then newcomers (macdowell & lambert), but i felt alienated: all the story is located in a big british mansion: no matter how luxurious is it, it was like a prison for me.at last, it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs' story of tarzan ? i don't know, having never read the book (or seen the disney): .in conclusion, i don't have any good moments to remember, so one viewing would be enough for me. i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called "overture" at the beginning... what's the meaning? only the director knows it.

i've read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book.. i don't think any of them have actually read it. edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters. we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view. i've never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgar's vision. maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story. so, if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals, maybe a good cry, see the movie. i hope john carter of mars get's more respect than tarzan has. we miss ya, edgar!

the incomparable paul naschy, horror film icon of spain, lends his talents to this entertaining if not scattershot film. what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story. all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride.paul naschy plays a cold-hearted hit-man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters (one of which is his flame who is carrying his child) to swipe a cache of diamonds from a belgian businessman. when the deed is done, the allure of the diamonds is too tempting for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese cohorts. his girlfriend, whose brother paul killed, vows revenge and chases paul through the forest, shooting him up and leaving him for dead. however, paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recuperate.at the estate, the two daughters, silvia aguilar and azucena hernandez, fight for paul in his weakened state, with the busty silvia aguilar determined not to lose out to the sweet and prim azucena. but things get hairy for mr. naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter's long dead mother on the estate grounds. couple this with the japanese lass looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides.story: $$ (the story goes a number of ways and doesn't fully satisfy. the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but silvia, whose character seems assertive and volatile, simply lets azucena win in the paul naschy sweepstakes without putting up a fight. personally, i would have preferred the ghostly apparition story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman)violence: $$$ (you get gunplay, a blown-up babe and pigs eating some poor schmuck alive. gore hounds will not be letdown with this naschy flick).acting: $$$ (paul naschy, as always, is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds. starring with him again are the luscious silvia aguilar and the beautiful azucena hernandez, who teamed with mr. naschy in the little gem "the craving." both girls do a fine job).nudity: $$$ (you get very brief glimpses of both aguilar and hernandez but they are strategically placed, keeping the naught bits covered. full nudity is supplied by the two lesser appealing actresses: the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for silvia and azucena).

this is just a long advertisement for the movie "the death tunnel". although it is an interesting history of the waverly hills sanatorium, the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation. more "ghost orbs" which you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera, and the "ectoplasmic mist" is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash. i couldn't see any "shadow people" until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image. no scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena, only paranormal. perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe, so be sure to make plans to visit the sanatorium on your next vacation in louisville, kentucky.

jacqueline hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual jackie hyde (co-producer gabriella hall) until her boss (robert donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work, however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather (malcolm bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me? sigh). very excited jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home, while looking for the thermostat late one night jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance. being a bit on the porky side jackie finally settles on the glamorous jacqueline (blythe metz), however jackie's better looking alter-ego starts to take control...written, co-produced & directed by rolfe kanefsky i thought jacqueline hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. according to the opening credits jacqueline hyde was 'inspired' by the classic robert louis stevenson novel 'the strange case of dr. jekyll and mr. hyde', frankly if mr. stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave. for a start i think jacqueline hyde was/is intended to be a horror film, the imdb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is. i would say that jacqueline hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it, why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? why, that's the question i ask here. it's not even good porn either, besides being far too soft it's dull, boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between. the most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the jacqueline hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the imdb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish. this is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.director kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of cgi look like they came from a nintendo gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect i've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when jackie's breasts grow via more terrible cgi. that's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. the subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.technically jacqueline hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. the acting was awful, seriously this is bad.jacqueline hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that i can think of. any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.

even with it's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here. it started out pretty good, and fairly engaging and believable. the actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development. my favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations. some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. the story starts out very airtight. and then... and then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on. no real believable end game for the villain? no real explanation of what's going on. generally if a movie has to use the f word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too. i still get offended believe it or not. i often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this. why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? no female actors/characters either? none at all? this had the makings to be another "predator" but alas fell far far short. my final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? what gives? my advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. make sure you got a good story before you start, and edit out bad special effects - it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.

going to need to take a deep breath for this one...terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget. blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like pitch black). terrible acting. endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes. meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story. characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. a "cargo" ship staffed by a camouflage-wearing crew of gun-toting soldiers (why exactly would you need forest-camouflage in space anyway?). some of the worst casting choices in the history of no-budget film-making - a steroid swollen "captain" who comes across more like a muscle-beach jock than a trustworthy commander, and a "convict" who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit. 70 minutes in length, 35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of "compression of time through editing"...i won't go on. suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can (and should) be forgiven due to it's low budget; the bad conception, laughable plot holes, and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on *any* budget. the end result is a tedious, dull, waste of time. sorry guys, i hate to be so harsh on an amateur film, but you've no excuse for turning out this kind of work.

i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. what a disappointment! there are so many ways that this movie is bad. the computer graphics were lacking to say the least. i found the acting stiff and unbelievable. watch the sand as the lost "e-pods" (what an original name!)are found. where did all the tracks come from? i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, ie alien, pitch black. come on,one huge ship to transport one prisoner? and what is with the prisoner? does he speak, can he speak? i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together, but it never came. if this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended. i don't mean that i liked the ending, i didn't. i just liked the fact that it was over. a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. in my opinion. don't waste your time on this one.

it is ok movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends. it is way below limits be called "professional". there isn't plot, no actors' play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film. i was so glad that i have ff button on my remote, 32x worked really well. i understand that everyone need to start somewhere, but it shouldn't be reason to bring it to the public. if you have concerns about quality and budget - "open water" was made on $60000 and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks. and that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy film-making.

this movie is proof you can't just go to a redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try.while i'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget, and at least a halfway decent script and story line... unfortunately, it was only just that: halfway decent.if you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up, and don't mind low-budget effects, you might like this film. honestly, it wasn't really my cup of tea. i should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching.for a better science-fiction movie produced on an even lower budget (!) have a look at "primer."

i think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it. if you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either. if you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained. it is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive. the dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor. as for the story well, i'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth.

(caution: several spoilers)someday, somewhere, there's going to be a post-apocalyptic movie made that doesn't stink. unfortunately, the postman is not that movie, though i have to give it credit for trying.kevin costner plays somebody credited only as "the postman." he's not actually a postman, just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western america devastated by some unspecified catastrophe. he trades with isolated villages by performing shakespeare. suddenly a pack of bandits called the holnists, the self-declared warlords of the west, descend upon a village that costner's visiting, and their evil leader gen. bethlehem (will patton) drafts costner. after much misery and numerous efforts to break costner's spirit, he escapes, thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three-minute flashback.we now finally get to the major premise: the escaped costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman. a number of the village people led by young ford (larenz tate) want to get in on this postman act, which does not sit well with bethlehem and his bandits, and costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of postmen at war with the holnists.the idea of the postmen versus the bad guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. the holnists depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another; the holnists can destroy any one village, but could not stand against all their victims united. to unite, the villages must communicate with one another, and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the holnists out of business. so it really makes a lot of sense that bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers. unfortunately, bethlehem's eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him, but instead your old standby cliche, the one-on-one brawl between him and costner. nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard "hi, aunt debbie" stuff played for maximum sentimental value.the postman is one of the most predictable movies, shot for shot, that i have ever seen. now, i don't purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out what's going to happen next. but here we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; i just knew what was going to happen next whether or not i wanted to know. after a lion is prominently showcased eating people, a holnist bandit seeking the escaped costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and we are then "shocked" when the lion eats him. a bunch of unoffending villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings out some famous last words right before being shot, to my immense lack of surprise. a covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there: costner bending to pick up a letter from a cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie. a man tells bethlehem that no sir, you can't just take my wife; bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sod through, though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting.but it is rank, cloying sentimentality that really undoes the postman. olivia williams, playing costner's lover abby, is worst served. she pours her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere. she tries so hard, it's heart-breaking. but nobody could ever have made the lines "i have a gift for you, postman . . . you give out hope like it's candy in your pocket" sound like anything but the syrupy pap that they are. another example is the scene where a mounted costner thunders past a little boy, ignoring his proffered letter, only to turn around, stare at him for what seems like five minutes, and then thunder back to pick up the letter. why didn't costner just pick it up the first time? no real reason; it's just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dashing the kid's hopes and then restoring them.schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the statue of the postman is revealed. i sat thinking, "please don't tell me they're going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the cutesy kid. surely that is too saccharine, too obvious for even this movie." then, alas, the music swelled and we did indeed cut back to the dreaded little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is whisked away, and i held my head in my hands and thought, "somebody shoot me." it felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie rammed down my throat.gen. bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal. your standard-issue post-apocalyptic villain is the meanest, toughest s.o.b. in the valley. bethlehem is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside, who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others. although some menace is thereby sacrificed, bethlehem is credible in a way most villains aren't. unfortunately, will patton overacts. and although we are told early on that bethlehem utterly destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat, bethlehem's actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrous.the acting is otherwise pretty good. costner has done better, but his razzie was an overreaction. as mentioned, olivia williams is very impressive. larenz tate as ford does a sincere and credible job. james newton howard's score is competent, though short of the epic standards the movie was going for. but it's not enough to save this film.rating: *1/2 out of ****.

its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by walt disney in the 1940s, but its true. here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story. irving's original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge. one can either completely rewrite the story a la tim burton which is a discussion for another time, or pad the bust-line of the old girl with unintended detail. the latter is what is attempted here, and if i may say, pitifully so. unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in crane or wanderlust in good old bram bones ruin the story's intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers. by the time the tale's famous climax approached, i had completely lost interest. its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background.

the depiction of ichabod crane's character was so terrifically unlikable, my wife and i were hoping that the horseman (or some other character) would not only cut off crane's head, but do it slowly and painfully.i mean, this brent carver guy played it over the top---like he was on broadway. and he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him whatsoever.i could go on with specific critiques of how this movie failed, but i prefer to not devote the energy.just skip it and go for the johnny depp version. either that, or rent the haunted pumpkin of sleepy hollow (animated). it is quite good--entertaining for kids and adults.better yet, read washington irving's original story.

crap! i accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the swimming upstream that was released in 2003. i seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it. shame on whoever gave this junk an award. i thoroughly loathed this film-in fact i didn't see it through to the end. after an hour i could no longer stand it. i am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such ba-ad acting. painful. i rate it 1 star out of 10. an amateur could make a much, much greater movie.

i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the 2003 swimming upstream with geoffry rush. this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen. the script was forced, the acting was subpar and the editing annoying. it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying. but i always give a movie a chance, so i suffered until the very end. apparently there was a memo out about this movie, because my friend and i were the only ones in the theater. why didn't somebody send me this memo?!?! that is why i'm posting, as a warning to others thinking of shelling out good money to see this. i just hope that you actually got to this page, and didn't get trapped like i did by looking at the wrong "swimming upstream." p.s. sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this. i know that you worked hard to make this. i know what goes into making a movie... keep trying!

i think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there, i actually thought quite the same as you do. but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv-show have to do, i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. that really is no easy work. and also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! i don't think that the material given to them can really show that, as i think this material isn't very good. but they are truly good! so i don't think that you, before you haven't seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! and i shouldn't have judged over them as well before i met them, but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it. so please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job.

let me preface this by going on record, i am a huge george clooney fan, and i love john krasinski in 'the office'. well, i was and i did.this was the world's worst hang nail and it took 113 minutes to rip it off. the stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over.every funny scene was in the previews. all three of them. there was no real story, no character development, and the script was just plain bad. i've had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyable.the title should have been superduper bad. this movie is a lock for a razzie. it should get a whole slough of razzies. i want my money back.

this is defiantly a dvd rental movie. i'm a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me. don't expect "oh brother where art thou" in any way shape or form. funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the argon. seems like they were trying to copy some of clooney's funny facial expressions from "oh brother where art thou" but you could kind of tell they were trying for that. john krasinski was the bright spot and was solid throughout. renee zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do whatever for the story. overall it's a movie worth watching at home.

ok where do i start? i saw a screening a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is. sure if you just love beverly hillbillies and green acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie. me, personally, i really like george's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great & funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen. it was a cute movie but would i pay $12.00 to see it? h&ll no !!!! now that i have seen it i would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money. george, buddy, i love you but please don't do any more comedies? this script is lacking a lot, great concept but just didn't do it.

i watched this movie only because i was under the impression that i was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick. i mean, look at the tag line: "they're men turned inside out! and worse... they're still alive!" does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you? and the then there's the title itself-- "screamers." what a perfectly apt title for a horror movie, i thought! unfortunately, i wasn't aware that the real title was, properly translated, "the island of the fishmen."so, about an hour into watching this i realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all-- it was a cheesy "adventure" story about slimy fish-men from atlantis. "men turned inside out"? no. there was nothing of the sort. i was grossly disappointed.damn you, misleading taglines! i want those 81 minutes of my life back!

ok by the time you read this i might have stopped crying. this movie was so horrible as to be quite vexing. the creatures are kinda cute, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting marooned on this daffy island. even seeing barbara bach with her hair all riffled was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop. she goes about with a whispery i've-never-used-my-voice-before breathiness that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder. (hey the leading man was cute too but i'm still not assuaged.) this is a cry-into-your-beer ripoff of the good ole island of dr. moreau. poor richard johnson, who was surely born for better things, is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy. i mean, how bad can a bad guy be? (ask richard johnson). joseph cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance. in the name of all that's holy, don't rent this darned bomb.

yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child. it was called "screamers" on this particular cover with the tagline "men turned inside out!". it even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind. perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off, maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get, a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage. yes, all these thoughts ran through my mind, one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore. this movie is really more like the island of dr. moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too, it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes. these films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes. yes i know, i have strange tastes, but i can not help it, i like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither.

maniratnam, who in india, is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making, has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good, without offering much food for thought.forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.while i would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world, still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots, does not contain lingering effects afterward and mostly contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama, seen profusely in indian movies.overall, maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once again.sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise. my suggestion to you: watch some beautiful cinemas made around the globe.

it's exactly what the title tells you...an island inhabited by fishmen. shipwrecked doctor claudio cassinelli and crew land on the island, they're either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic richard johnson. cassinelli discovers that johnson, who believes he's found the lost city of atlantis, has been keeping disgraced scientist joseph cotten and his daughter barbara bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea. cotten, of course, is a complete madman. bach and cassinelli have great chemistry. this insanity was directed by sergio martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. it's fast paced, reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things don't look like actual fishmen). there's an excellent music score by luciano michelini.

i saw this movie as part of a billy graham program. the church i attend was part of a community wide outreach to present god and christianity to our community (hartford, ct. usa). i was one of the counselors who helped attendees (who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wanted...and to follow up on them after the movie. as such, it did what it was supposed to do, and i personally found it to be a medium to strengthen my faith in god.i also found it to be very helpful to those i counseled. i especially like the work of kim darby in this movie. and the parents (the wintons?) were , in a way, a little overdrawn....no one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an illegitimate child something like the wintons did "oh, no, no, not thaaat." that isn't exactly what they said, but the sympaathetic audience i saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say, and also at the son's emphatic "no, mom, not me." don berghuis

this version is very painful to watch. all of the acting is very stilted but especially that of norma shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie. check out the 1937 version with joan crawford, robert montgomery and william powell which is much more entertaining.

i found this early talkie difficult to watch and i'm a norma shearer fan! it's not her fault, but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored. 90% of the movie is filmed with "medium shots," and it's very similar to watching a dull play.

you'd hardly know that a year later mgm put norma shearer in the divorcee which glows with mgm technical know how. how far they came in one year. cheney is a very stagey early talkie. the camera hardly moves. shearer is her usual charming self and rathbone does well in a romantic leading role. they are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene, but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if one's expectations are not too high. oh, by the way, the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims. there are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all. an oscar nom for best screenplay adaptation.

i think it's two years ago since i have seen the movie and till this day it's the worst film i have ever seen. the only thing i thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some tax reason. so after all this time i finally spilled my gut ;) and now imdb says i have to fill 10 lines with comments:"sorry, you must provide at least 10 lines in your comment. please return to the edit window (or use the back option if this isn't a new window)."please there is nothing to say anymore...sorry for some bad english.

i admit it now. this is one of the lamest films ever made. but, in mr sjogrens defense, the "not really"-scene wasn't all bad! and you gotta love the effort of going all the way to sweden just to find a sweet swedish 15 year old blonde, have her speak swedish posing as the jewish mother of henry (dennis hopper). what makes this scene so perfect is that henrys father answers the blonde swedish-speaking(jewish?) girl in german... the best actor/actress of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of henrys mother, this is a woman who has had no experience whatsoever of acting, but still puts in the most convincing performance of all!all and all, this flick is nostalgia for me personally, it is after all what gave me a posting on imdb:s database. :d//feelin like a movie-star*

the worst movie i've ever seen. i still don't understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in. maybe they had bills to pay... the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife. that's the beginning of a typical serial killer life! it seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80's but then appears a new beattle... amazing! this movie was directed in 2001... i'm quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie. i heard that dennis hopper's wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat. pathetic!

i thought choke had potential, but i thought it could have been a much better film. it had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed kind of pointless. when showing background on the two main characters, some of that really seemed to go awry. most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all. this was also not dennis hopper's finest hour. however, the main saving grace of this movie for me was michael madsen. his performance was excellent. in this movie, he almost makes mr. blonde look like a nice guy. all in all, it was watchable. still, i was left thinking some things could have been done differently. these things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion.

a blind person could have shot this movie better...seriously! the director is clearly a novice. he must be dennis hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie. i felt so embarrassed for dennis.to john, the director...please retire from directing. your contribution is not needed nor wanted. the medium of film is stronger without you. you are terrible at directing. stick to bagging groceries or something.this movie should've bypassed "straight to video" and gone "striaght to the trashcan." i'm a dumber person for having seen this movie. do not see this movie if you respect yourself and respect the artform of film!

like most everyone who views this movie, i did it for the stars michael madsen and dennis hopper. the two are extremely underrated and sadly, because of that, have to headline a lot of crap. in this film, hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help from the mysterious madsen.the film actually isn't as terrible as it could have been. i've seen both in much worse, both independently and working together (lapd, horrible film). the direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few re-writes, but both give the best performance possible with the material offered. also the ending is pretty strong, so you can tell the story had potential. but when a glowing review of a film is, "it could have been much worse", it doesn't say much for the film itself.all in all, this is one that can easily be skipped if neither of these actors draw you in. but if you're a fan of either or both, give it a watch. they both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film. trust me, there are much worse options out there.

i'd like to start by saying i would not go see this movie again if they were giving out popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket granted me eternal life. this movie was terrible. i can't give this it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars. the acting is absolutely terrible. this movie is a travesty, based on the classic, "the most dangerous game". if you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like gigli. at least j-lo provides some better scenery, ben should pacify the ladies viewing it. i'm not upset about the $7 i paid to see the move, i'd just like the 90 minutes of my life back."can you give me my time back!?!" samuel l. jackson, changing lanes

at times when i watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.what's wrong with this film i'll tell you bad plot,bad jokes.bad acting and flat-out characters everything just bad.the movie is about pest vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a german hunter who kills people for a living.so now pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed.i know what your thinking "what the hell is this?" a another wannabe ace ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film.as for the funny scenes this film i had a straight face oh yeah i did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching ace ventura meets dumb and dumber but bad.as for character development it's dry and flat.you don't learn much about the main character pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for the german hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to germany.the hunter's son himmel fares better but not much.he's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end he stands up to his father and sides with pest.as for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.for example john legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for jeffery jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top.overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at k-mart.

i actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. i was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. i made it about an hour through before i simply had enough. curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, i looked it up on this site. i was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. i needed to have my say, and here it is: this movie is absolute garbage. it was a chore to sit through. the "jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. that actually may be a stretch even for that age. i'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. i have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. now that's funny. ha. ha.movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: the marx brothers' a night at the opera, monty python's the meaning of life, south park: bigger, longer, and uncut,...and the list goes on. don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap.by the way, i can only assume that the reason that david bar katz (the other writer) did very little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. i'm actually impressed that leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

obviously, the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone who's on the crew. i don't recall ever seeing a movie that's more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching. in my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one i have ever walked out of. bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. note to producer: it's never funny to hunt humans based on race. great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you're still hunting humans based on race, and that's sickening.

this was the worst movie i have ever seen. i have to admit i didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining.the 'star' was the most unpleasant character i've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary.it is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors.as horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a puerto rican one is even worse. the name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. this movie is a must miss.

this is a terrible movie, don't waste your money on it. don't even watch it for free. that's all i have to say.

john leguizamo must have been insane if he thinks this was a funny movie. i laughed more times watching remains of the day. pathetic plot, unbearable acting. horrible music -- michael sambello is a "maniac."

just to save you the $3, or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store, and the anguishing hour-and-however-long-this-movie-is here's a simple plan. go over to a friend's house, talk them into renting the pest for you, watch the first 30 seconds or so and then make up some excuse to leave. the opening sequence is really funny, definitely worth watching. unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. without the shower scene at the beginning this is one of the worst movies of all time.

i was unfortunate enough to see this movie at a friends' house. what an utter waste of time. what an utter and complete piece of crap this movie is! absolutely nothing is funny in it, from the shower scene to the insulting and degrading portrayal of germans. there is no plot, the acting made me gag and at the end, i personally wanted to beat john leguizamo with a stick. i thought john woo movies were bad.....this movie is officially the worst movie that i have ever seen.

this movie is pathetic in every way possible. bad acting, horrible script (was there one?), terrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. just plain horrible.i had seen 'the wishmaster' a couple weeks before this movie and i thought it was a dead-ringer for worst movie of the year. then, i saw 'the pest' and suddenly 'the wishmaster' didn't seem so bad at all.bad bad bad. excruciatingly bad.

obviously, this one doesn't aim for the brain : the so-called "humour" is based on farting and every cliché about any ethnic genre you can imagine, gays included of course, as long as they are not wasp. and a latino cowrote this ? besides, john leguizamo does have talent and charisma, but in such a self-indulgent movie it is a definite waste. what the point in trying to out-jim carrey jim carrey himself ? "the pest" of the title could then be this movie, almost as funny as bergman's finest. prepare to be annoyed, not amused

the sole reason for someone wanting to see this film would be because of john leguizamo. i remember the previews, and it looked to be another second rate comedy. but the fact that mr. leguizamo starred, tried to redeem it. his name, how known it was at the time or not, tried to sell it.i was pretty disappointed with the performance of leguizamo. his days on "house of buggin'" (an "in living colour" clone), were his tip-top. there is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy, and we'll just say that leguizamo crossed it tenfold. he looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and crazy for the camera. as a matter of fact, i'll say that he tried too hard. madcap humor spilled over into stupidity, and the film was spoiled. i can't say i blamed him, if you were given this opportunity, you'd try as hard if you could, right? your eagerness cost you dearly though mr. leguizamo...the pest follows in the tradition of any comedy film, and plays the "race card", and more. no group is left out from being poked fun at. blacks, latinos, whites, jews, koreans, germans, homosexuals, and the blind are among those singled out. again here, things get too overboard, and too much tries to get spoofed in too little time. the resolution of the film takes all of five minutes to clear up and move back to normality.when you have a film, and you're going to bypass plot and reality for comedy's sake, just make sure it's funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of senseless film. which would sum up leguizamo's "pest" quite nicely...

i am almost tempted to demand my money back from the video store. this movie plumbs the depths of inanity and is almost completely unwatchable. i never bail out of a film early but this was painful to view. a thorough waste of celluloid. my vote 1/10 (it would have been zero).

what a turd! i like john leguizamo but man this is bad. i thought spawn was the worst movie he had been in, but i was wrong. i like all types of comedy from stuff like ace ventura 2 to american werewolf in london. this is a piece of trash.

ok, i'm normally pretty open minded about movies. i can normally see a good side to a film which has been totally pandered by others. this is an exception.i won't waste to much energy telling you what happens, but think along the lines of bill and ted meets the worst police academy movie out of all of them and you won't be far off.the thing that really got me about this film was the stupid purile racism that was evident throughout. the general theme of latino/black guys = cool, white guys = lame is slightly amusing for the first couple of jokes but when the same joke has been reiterated for the 500th time (not an exageration by the way) it gets both tiresome and offensive.i spent months waiting for the laws of karma to get back at john leguizamo for this film. i had almost given up hope when the 'my vh1 awards' were screened live in the uk. what followed was mr leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage. you'd have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him. ahem. ha! ha! ha!

a friend of mine who has a mysterious knack for finding and - horrors! - liking bad movies recommended i watch 'the pest.' at the time unaware of just how truly pathetic his taste in movies was, i decided to give it a try.bad mistake.the story, although clearly ripped straight out of any sixth grade english textbook as far as the "manhunter" theme goes, would be amusing under the right conditions - good actors, writer, director, wardrobe, and so on and so on to almost no end. clearly these factors are absent.'the pest' is supposed to be funny, i think. i say "think" because i let crack nothing more than a slight smile throughout the whole film. not a guffaw, not a laugh, not a chuckle, not even a grin. a smile, at best. and that happened so rarely while watching this film i even remember how often i did smile - maybe 3 or 4 times at best.so do yourself an immense favor. never watch this movie. avoid at all costs.

i can't believe that there are people out there who voted 10 for this garbage! have any of you gained access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtably kept, or is there a special colony where especially crass people are secretly imprisoned that i don't know about?if i was to say what i really thought of this film, none of it would get published.to begin with its 'star' is a no talent idiot who acts like a bad impersonator of jim carrey who has hoovered enough angel dust up his nose to resurface the sahara desert. his name will be a total guarantee that i will not watch a future film with him in it - even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd.as for the 'plot'. one more crime that we can chalk up to the nazis is that they were so awful that they can be considered fair game as 'baddies' in tripe like this; mere criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in a trice.to the people who made this movie - give up making films and if not then confine yourself to making advertisements, where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration.finally, a criticism of imdb - why don't you have the facility to vote 'zero' for a film? or perhaps not. to express my contempt for this tripe i would then have to vote double zero, or something.

there is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans. its quite good, and its been done and redone in film and tv many many times. some are notable, but this urbanized version, that injects the tired old racism themes, just flat out stinks. leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script. chaplin, this guy isn't. there must be people who find a dwarf who cant stop dancing funny, i mean i suppose it is funny in a pathetic freakish way, but its just not enough to carry a movie. you have the usual nazi holdover or neo-nazi whatever the heck we are supposed to think, type villain, who's son of course is gay, german accents...get the picture?

...un-funny and un-entertaining, possibly the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to watch. think 'ernest goes to..' humour done even worse. myself and my girlfriend sat through it just to see if it could be as consistently dire as it seems in the opening sequence... yes it is. avoid at all costs.

only watched this to see joe morton in an early role and honestly wished i hadn't bothered, he can and has since, done much better than this crap. cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least. no wait, one line only was funny, where mr kent (joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner (lord alone knows why). pest to mr kent: you know what it's like dog, you've been there mrs kent: not lately, joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart, it's only good enough for that. joe morton - glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore; you are far superior and a great great actor.

an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition. seeing as terrence malick produced this, i expected something haunting and lyrical. instead, we get a typical norwegian co-production ("revolution" with al pacino, anyone?), where - quite possibly - good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay, and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. the "me-tarzan-you-jane" english dialogue between the non-english-speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy  one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth ad-libbed their own, as they almost sound like real people. the story is loaded with implausibility: we are expected to believe that binh can speak a smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not grammatical command, increases impressively in the malayan refugee camp, without the benefit of night classes). coincidence is rife; i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third: he tracks down his mother in ho chi minh city almost immediately - after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother, who nonchalantly recognises him! mum gives him a gold locket (or something similar of great value) as they part, but this is never referred to again. his relationship with "me dead inside" ling is supposed to provide the obligatory "love interest", but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in "gangs of new york". the voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails. indeed, the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable, is the jerky, hand-held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions. (incidentally, a boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast, without stopping for fuel or supplies, is certainly an epic journey). the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malick's use of magic hour, but i want to know why the coast guard didn't show up. perhaps they were watching the super bowl, or something. of course, binh manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas, with the same navigational flair he displayed in ho chi minh city. i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick. for demonstration of how a story about the travails befalling refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget, check out michael winterbottom's far superior "in this world".

my wife and i never got into the movie.we thought it was way to sloooowwww and to many subtitles.i understood they needed them for vietnam,but took to long to get out of asia.she wanted it off i said it's going to get better.it never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to america,but i wanted to see him looking and finding his dad.not at the end but forming a relationship.did i mention it was slllloooowwwwww.i love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end.i know they don't make many good movies now days.i think action movies are the only ones to watch.i have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster,maybe 20% are worth seeing.i don't kneed realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good.gary

thursday june 9, 9:15pm egyptian theater saturday june 11, 2:00pm uptown theaterbeing loved and belonging is essential for most children. those born to vietnamese mothers and gi fathers often found neither. the beautiful country is the story of one such child, binh, rejected by his rural village then struggling to find his american father. the film begins with green and wild country but descends into grimy sweaty ugliness and boredom. the considerable talents of tim roth and temuera morrison are wasted in pointless and ill conceived roles aboard the rusting freighter carrying binh and is dying brother across the ocean with what appear to be stock shots of stormy seas. new york city offers slave labor and cliché characters. while very uneven from it's start the great curiosity of this film is the final segment. nick nolte is given top billing among the cast. i jokingly suggested he would probably be in the final scene only and was not far from the truth. as the journey brings binh to texas and his father the film takes on a serene and austere simplicity. a tenuous cohabitation knits these two men together into a family of father and son. the ninety odd minutes of garbage we have just watched is rewarded by a profound and subtle performance from nolte as they slowly interact. the credits rolled and i was surprised to see the names of badlands executive producer edward pressman and west texas native terrence malick.

"the beautiful country" is a big disappointment. it doesn't come up to my expectation. bihn, a tall muscular guy, is a son of an american gi and a vietnamese woman during vietnam war. we were told that that he was treated "less than dust" in vietnam in the early 90s, so he fleeted to america to seek his american father.sounds like a heart broken material? maybe, but showing in this film. i find myself having a hard time to connect to bihn emotionally, because the film is full of cliché and i simply don't understand or believe him. the writing of this film is a total failure. the plot is full of holes. it grabs some events on a needed basis trying hard to stir the emotion of the audience. we are not that stupid and it doesn't work that way. let's see what the film is trying to do. so, you don't feel bihn's boat trip (yeah, he was on a boat!) is hard enough, let's have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little. still not touched? fine! get a little kid to suffer the heat, the hungry, the sickness, the violence with the adults on the boat, hopefully that will do the trick to touch the audience. still not touched? you heartless sob, let's... ok, i don't want to give any spoiler of the film, but you get the idea.the film is really long and slow. it never tell us why bihn didn't go to find his mom and dad, until the moment in the film when he left to look for his mom and dad. what has he been doing the 20 some years before he went to saigon to look for his mom? and guess what? he has the luck and everybody will tell him where to find the person he is looking for, and he will find anybody without a scratch. i really think the department of homeland security should hire those vietnamese who helped bihn. the beautiful country? which one? both vietnam and america seem hell to bihn.

if i guess your "palabra", will you let me go through?- asks william geld, a tim robbins that keeps on acting like if they told him a fantastic joke and he is attempting not to laugh.he is trying to get to a forbidden area. the woman stopping him continues blabbering: -your "palabra" is carrefour.-how did you know?- the lady asks, surprised. he answers, in the name of wisdom: -i was hearing when you weren't talking. :/yes, this defines the movie. this precisely. it doesn't matter if carrefour is "road conjunction" in french, or if the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages. or if samantha morton has nothing, nothing of spanish (maria gonzalez being her name in the film) with her irish, scotish whatever tone.it's boring and dull. if you fall in believing there are multiple symbolisms, you will buy the most bizarre, sickening love relationship ever, set in a future that may well be in seven seconds. i can guess this movie's palabra: it will be "painful".

many times the description "full of sound and fury signifying nothing" is used and is right on target. unfortunately "code 46" lacks both sound and fury. a bit of fury would have been greatly appreciated. tim robbins character (william) is so lacking in passion that the idea of his falling instantly in love with maria (samantha morton) seems almost absurd. these folks are so passionless that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been dosed with thorazine. there is a "brave new world" sort of atmosphere to the film that is helped along by every scene being shot about 2-3 stops overexposed. unfortunately this technique gets tedious and rather hard on the eyes. the cutesy mishmash of languages also grows tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence. many futuristic, scifi films are criticized for being all flash and no substance. this film has neither flash nor substance. its a code 6 all the way.

i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'gone with the wind' should ever have been undertaken. having expressed that, i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood. i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe.

...but not this one! i always wanted to know "what happened" next. we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret's baby. i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie. i did compare "scarlett" to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first. rhett was cast beautifully, although no one will ever compare to mr. gable. i am also a strict vivien leigh fan!! she was scarlett. she fit the bill. not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with "scarlett" the job could have been done better. not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett, that was evident.overall, something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett, i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction. this movie is not worth the time.

as an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

i've read the book 'scarlett' and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it. i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed. the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like. one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed. it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. a fine movie, but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was, had it more true to alexandra rippley's book.

as everyone knows, nobody can play scarlett o'hara like vivien leigh, and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable. all others pale in comparison, and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions. one thing that i really couldn't get past was that joanne has brown eyes. the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she has been stripped of those.the movie, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. the new characters weren't all that memorable, and i found myself forgetting who was who. i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. it could be that i'm only 11, but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say, 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up. if rhett hadn't told her that, i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude. she really loved cat, her baby. she likes this child best because she had it with rhett, her only loved husband. still, if you've read gone with the wind, you would see that children make no difference in scarlett's world. quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett. all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together, and scarlett took way too long to get to that. it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind, but then again what isn't? if you have read the novel, you will like that better than the movie.i would watch it, just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind, regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile. it may not satisfy you entirely, but it will get you some of the way there.

if you really loved gwtw, you will find quite disappointing the story. those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south, will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production (altought i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett). but, let me say that considering the novel, nothing good could came out of this.i've read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs. mitchell did for the film. it took me some time to understand how good the ending was: scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett, since she always got what she wanted. but there was no kiss in the end.then alexandra ripley came to "fix" this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be, and of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could have been further from mrs. mitchell mind, i am sure).the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends, showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending.if margaret mitchell could came to live again, she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after gwtw.sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault. isn't it? is it any good if i don't compare it to the original? maybe. sorry to say i don't really care.i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's (suberb) work, otherwise don't even try.

"the danish bladerunner" is boldly stated on the box. are you kidding me?! this film is a complete drag. when i'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, i usually pause the vcr, so i won't miss anything. not this time. i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge, just so i wouldn't have to go back. why the hell is there not one sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? it's mindboggling. one of the premises of film, is that our hero (who's a hacker), has a little computerassistant to help him (the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future). when he loses the assistant in the movie, he's helpless and can't get into any computers. he's a hacker! it's like saying, that you can't drive your car, if you don't have your lucky "driving-cap" on. i won't even go into the lightning-effect when he recieves electroshock...

a desperate attempt to make a "film-noir" sci-fi thriller, but the movie falls short. it has no believable plot, some of the key actors were a joke (not lars bom, he is cool!). i did like the "access restriction by bandwith maximizing" though. i finished it on principle, but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life...

i think the cards were stacked against webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but i couldn't quite put my finger on it. then it hit me. dubbed. for a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over or off screen, with just a little hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. this is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. i hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it.what i wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). what i got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without his little ego, and a director who obviously didn't know how to handle a camera. i just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. the editing wasn't much better. the acting? well, i guess if the lead guy didn't have such a bad script to work from, he'd be at least watchable. the main bad guy was ok, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. dubbing didn't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration.before i get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. well, one or two. despite the rudimentary graphics, i rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. the falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. the heart gadget, which reminded me of guillermo del toro's cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of escape from new york, it was horribly conceived in the long run. there's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there. why didn't he try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better.now, who here dares compare this movie to blade runner? both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. there's the investigation of a murder, but i've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either blade runner or webmaster. identity, for instance. that's about where the similarities end. period. there is no comparison, just as there wouldn't be between blade runner and hackers. ridley scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. it's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to get her to point b by herself without the hero, so that he could do his thing. very convenient. or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.).it tries to be hip, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. but a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.

l'humanité is a murder mystery. these movies tend to be popular,and the 6.9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been, too.unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.a few non-spoilers, for instance, include a 5-minute scenewherein the main character eats an apple. and another 3 minuteswhere he breathes.in case you were wondering, this is not, in fact, art. neither is it acommentary on humanity, which from the title it seems it is tryingto be. it is, in fact, boring. there are numerous attempts in thismovie to say something about humanity. one might think toonesself, "how would i comment on humanity?" and the mostobvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love, and death.not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just thatthey are the canonical options. for sex, this movie does its best tomake it unattractive and disgusting. in your first five minutes -hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of amurdered 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery, remember? lateron, a few people throw themselves at each other and have whatthe director would like us to believe is "raw" sex, but in reality it'scontrived and overly symbolic - but worse yet, uninterestingly so.i enjoy being disturbed by movies. this movie showed me why:disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone,their humanity, which they did not know existed and are a bitscared of. l'humanité tried to do just this and failed, and i walkedout of the theatre not disturbed, but disgusted, thinking that i hadwasted my time in the theater, despite having seen the movie forfree.

although this movie has a slow, dream-like, almost mesmerizing pace, and an interesting, though possibly not entirely accurate, description of a rural french constabulary's criminal investigation practices and personnel, i find it, ultimately, impossible to recommend. i think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance one person's -- the director's, one presumes -- disgust with heterosexuality. certainly, human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments, no denying that! but to choose the bad uniformly at the expense of the good, as this film does at every turn, suggests a warped sensibility at work. in short, if you enjoy watching homo-eroticism masquerading as compassion, and the depiction of heterosexual lovemaking and the female form in a hideous and degrading light - then this movie is for you. i don't , and it wasn't.

this french film is supposedly about a creepy, dim-witted cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. however, the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. if it takes a character ten minutes to walk from point a to point b, the film spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are the "action" scenes. there are also static shots that last for minutes, making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote. the script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. the movie lasts seven hours or so. you do the math. the actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. note to self: never see a dumont movie again.

just had the misfortune to see this truly awful film.think of that scene in magnolia at the end with the slow pan in on that woman. now, remove the pan, add breathing and unshaven men to the mix, and you have what the entire 2 and a half hours of humanity wasthe inspector is a true dolt, not even a dolt, just a dim witted, slow moving simpleton. how they ever solved a crime is beyond me.obligatory sex scenes are awful, and gratitious.eventual villain of the piece (he raped and killed an 11 year old girl) is signposted very early and no surprise unless your are similarly dimwitted.uninspiring camera work.the director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation on the proceedings. i assume he also meant provide their own dialogue (there is bugger all - adding to its boredom level), inventive camera work (just static shots, totally stripping away the obvious beauty of the landscape the film is being shot in) and plot!truly awful.0 out of 10.

i can't remember when was the last time i have been so terribly disappointed by any movie. probably i expected too much happening (in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies of course). but there is just nothing going on in here. luckily i was watching it at home and could switch channels whenever the silence and dumb/numb faces started to kill me. and that was very often! it really isn't too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who don't talk and move slowly, stroke pigs and french kiss men, not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex. if only it made any sense... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; seems like it was only created to show one more vagina since zero characters are capable of actually solving the crime. having only four pseudo developed characters and a movie going nowhere it is pretty soon obvious whom the director picked as a killer. and that makes no sence either. despite all the boredom and suffering i must admit that it somehow touched me in an unexplainable way. maybe you should check it out yourself though i don't recommend it.

shameless waste of my time as a viewer. this is one of the worst films i've seen in ages. please do not rent it as you will regret doing so! guaranteed! i wonder how kathleen turner ended up in this! she is a legitimate actress and people would perhaps be attracted to this film because of her. but it really is better to act as if this title was never made! it should not have come into existence!

i am the kind of person who can enjoy a good b movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it, but dead space has nothing to redeem it! this is the kind of film that will make you frustrated, restless and sick to your stomach. bad acting. lame story. terrible effects. horrible, excruciating dialogue. dead space has it all!

the production value of avp2 can be described by one adjective: awfulthe script is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of avp: what are the facehuggers good for on the predator's ship? why is the predator cleaning up all signs of his influence and than wasting precious time with eviscerating and even presenting the body of an insignificant human cop? why is the predator alone? why is the predator equipping himself only on earth but on his home planet? why does the predator make his job so uneasy for himself by hunting down the aliens rather than bombing the whole countryside like the humans do in the end? why is the predator dropping more & more of his few weapons rather than collecting them to keep them together after using one. in the end he is even dropping his armor before fighting the predalien in hand to hand combat: what a bad plagiarism of the first predators final fight between arny and the predator. the predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a japanese sumo than like highly skilled extraterrestrial-safari-hunter. as one can see immediately the whole story is a mess. but it gets even worse because this botched-up job is filled up with boring patchwork of senseless interludes like a lengthy pizza ordering episode or some detailed information about the criminal past of the two brothers (dallas & ricky). the sheriff is of course the friend of these two criminals who he puts regularly behind bars. (not convincing & absolutely superfluous for the plot).in addition to that the cast of actors is horrible. compared to the high class of directors & actors of the former aliens or predator movies avp2 is an embarrassingly bad piece of crap.at last the action of the movie is really poor. there is not a single scene of action combat in which the audience can see the whole set. each and every fight is filmed in short & shaky bursts with close up zoom at nearly full darkness. that results in an atrocious experience for the audience because one can mostly see nothing but a dark shaky screen.i suggest the two directing brothers strause to buy themselves a steadycam and get a lesson in modern cg so that the next film contains some visible action of visible figures and might not need to disguise their bad directing abilities in such a manner.i would advise anybody (even die hard avp fans) against watching this film: prefer the first one or the original aliens or the original predator films but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure.

this entry doesn't contain a spoiler. it doesn't have to. the movie is as predictable as the sunrise. the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen. this was so in the first two predator movies, though less prevalent. requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore. you know people are going to die (well duh, it is a avsp movie), but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die, and where they are going to die before it happens. the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said, "suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table. suspense is a bomb not going off under the table". what's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when? if you really, really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out on video and then rent it, but by no means would i ever buy it.

the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. no you shouldn't. there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can "spoil" this rotten movie i have no idea. even if you are a die hard alien/pred fan like i am wait for the dvd. it isn't worth a 3.99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater.in the theater i watched avpr there were exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. other than that there was total silence throughout. no ooohs, or "that was bad ass!", nothing. imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic. now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of avpr.what was the budget on this movie? like war of the worlds, mi 3, and other f/x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. spielberg has tried and failed at this several times, usually with tom cruise. sure the movies make money but should they? war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script, tom cruise et al, and ss himself but were still awful. i'm sure avp wasted 90% of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random.there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised. who cares who gets killed? we didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit, we all know the blood is acid. in alien, aliens, 3, resurrection, and even avp the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think, can hide and can lay traps. this director decided that the ridley scott, james cameron, and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed. in this installment you will never care who lives or dies, not a kid, a parent, a pregnant woman. the characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. the character development scenes mix clichés, bad humor, and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways. but they don't. the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and stealing the rest from other recent sci-fi films.there is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters. the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage. the alienpred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim's throat.simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie. there is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past. but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die. the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids, women, or anyone else lives or dies. we just want the movie to end. eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a nuke aim gunnison's way to wipe out the "infection". and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it? in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last.sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal acting, decent f/x that were wasted because of the many flaws.i don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed. the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget. for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed. this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. sad to say that a preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of avpr and hb2 didn't even look that good.

i really, really don't understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb. it's simply a huge mess, and i have to admit that i actually liked avp 1: close to no story, okay, i can live with that, but at least they got to the point pretty much at once. avp 2 does not. after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and unfitting teenager clichés, dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else, except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didn't care enough to be bothered.after that, that crap-fest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens, or at least pretends doing so. and boy, is that predator stupid, blind and deaf. it's awful. how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me. he misses with almost every shot, only notices aliens when they're right in his face or if it's absolutely necessary for the script, so that he can move where he has to be. he even gets caught on surprise by puny human teenagers and deputies all of the time. what's that guy supposed to be? after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene. close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs, stupid predator actions or stupid lack there-of or stupid actions from our "heroes".then, that thing finally ended. to my surprise not only me and my friends didn't know whether to laugh or to cry, but everybody i overheard leaving the room was half-crying, half-laughing about those 1 1/2 hours they just wasted.don't watch. never.

i love b movies, but i like to be aware from the beginning that i'm watching one. i can't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad. aliens and predator are awesome. this movie made a big joke out of them. the creators didn't take this movie seriously at all. i am throughly disappointed in how the strauss jerks handled this film. they made a mockery of amazing characters. it's like they were trying to be serious in the beginning, then their writers got high and gave up. almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators. i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and predators seriously anymore. these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films. they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves

from what i understand, fox was embarrassed they released a pg-13 alien/predator movie not so long ago. it was not well received by any means.not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.these monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen burton's planet of the apes remake and house of the dead. their first task: hire actors. fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. they hired fifteen tv actors shortly after.now, the script. the monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. they butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the aliens and predators. the monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible avp original and go with the man-in-the-suit alien seen in the old films. the actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. as for the predators, the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. but what about the effects, you ask? come on now, people. they may be monkeys but they clearly knew cgi would play a key role in the film. without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard final cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent predator visions.the setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. if this was to be on earth, in colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. this was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. see, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. they simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. to add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. but again, rookie mistake.the rating. fox told the monkeys to make the movie r-rated. that was easy. without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. it was simple: the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence.some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. why does a blue liquid the predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the aliens? why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? the list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. fox was thrilled with their work. so thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on christmas day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. the monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.but some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? they put it towards their next film: aliens vs. predator vs. hulk hogan. they knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:"to the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. it will be rated r and will have violence."and everyone lived happily ever after. the end.

this frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story i loved as a teenager, but now find rather distasteful. in the case of may-september attachments, doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust, or an inability to face the reality of aging, or both. and the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she (or he) lacked as a child. these underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now; there is also something rather predatory about them.dick powell looked a bit embarrassed--as well he should--at playing the elder lover in this silly story. he was, at fifty, attempting the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teen-ager. but young debbie reynolds was a knockout--pretty and saucy and full of vinegar--as a misbehaving seventeen-year-old presented as a kind of "gift" to the morally upright and honest screenwriter, as a subject for him to study. her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve. anne francis was cast as powell's beautiful, but brittle fiancée, and handled her small role deftly.some of the dialogue was quite amusing, too, so it's not a total washout.5/10

a ridiculous comedy given an arms-flailing direction. i love one of the comments here: "couldn't be made today". well, neither could "the philadelphia story" without a car chase or two. nonetheless, does that mean the picture is worse for the wear for being old-fashioned? i don't think "susan slept here" was good for any generation and it should fester peacefully in the memories of debbie reynolds-buffs. there is no sparkle in this story of a screenwriter who latches onto a much-younger girl for 'script research'. dick powell makes his farewell screen appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him. reynolds is pallid. produced by one harriet parsons--who gives her famous mother louella a number of inane plugs. *1/2 from ****

this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it, how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves. this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it. there are good class-b movies, and i do not reject the genre. when they are good, they catch the interest with the action, they have characters written well enough, and acted well enough so that you can care about them. the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases, and you may like them for the originality. almost nothing is true in 'coronado'. the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. the effects are cheap - and i do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget, but you need some talent. there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. you do not care for the characters, you do not laugh, and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. the only quality i could find is the scenery, there are some good locations, worth a much better film. 2/10 on my personal scale. the worst film of the year so far.

i obtained this little piece of scuzz on the videoasia "tales of voodoo" dvd label. quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in, i have no idea. indeed i would not usually connect voodoo with indonesia anyway (let alone with wips).i know and love wip movies. i have seen most of them. i could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the cover.it is appalling. you cannot have a wip movie if the women keep their clothes on (even in the shower!). although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre, wip without nudity is like a big mac without the beef.as my gym teacher used to say, on the whole, i'd rather be at the disco....

island of death is not really a good movie, by any standard, but it is a curious one. imagine if natural born killers had been made 20 years too early, as a greek eurotrash porn film. that's what you get here - the quaint story of a young, sociopathic british couple cutting a deadly swath through the population of a lovely little greek island.i'll spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot; it's not really important except to set up increasingly perverse or violent sex scenes followed by disturbingly brutal murders, often lovingly photographed for posterity by our charming young couple. it could have been brilliant, in its own sick and nasty way, but instead...instead, i found myself impatiently checking the run time and chapter index to see how much longer the parade was going to last. sluggish pacing and listless, bland acting turn even vilest perversities into pablum, and connecting scenes into an eternity of dull plodding. ah, well. you can't win 'em all.

director nico mastorakis has made a cynical cash-grabber (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan.the most extreme, confronting genre pics, to paraphrase a character in videodrome, "have a philosophy"; that is what makes them dangerous.island of death's philosophy is to throw many "shocking" elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly. the result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance.not to be confused with serrador's brilliant who could kill a child? (sometimes called island of death), mastorakis's effort is set on a greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a little bestiality and some wholesale perversion.everything moves at a snailish pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed.touted as "the movie that the censors didn't want you to see", i'd hazard a guess that the censors never saw it, they simply read the presskit until their knees jerked upwards.

how on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie? the lack of script is one thing, but the cinematography makes you want to weep. a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. i am well aware that the actors are amateurs but it's of no defence since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in sweden. it would be a shame for the industry if he (or any in the team for that matter) is given money to make a film ever again. this movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in sweden each year.

i saw recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival and i can't believe that this is sweden's official submission to the 79th academy awards to be considered for best foreign film. producer anna anthony last year also had sweden's official submission for best foreign film with zozo. i wasn't personally a fan of zozo but at least it had some production value to it. this could have been shot as a high school film project. as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as it's characters. this is a story about five twenty something friends who live in a small swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long gone childhood. actually falkenberg isn't like some remote northern swedish village. it's a popular summer resort with a population of city and townships of almost 40,000 and lies between two major southern coastal swedish cities of götborg and malmo. the characters are likable enough guys but if they were high school age kids with a bleak or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives i would undoubtedly care about them more. they are however long past the point where they should be making plans to deal with adulthood. if they want to stay in falkenberg forever than certainly there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just riding bicycles, drinking, smoking pot and occasionally painting a house. maybe if they hung around with a girl or two in their circle of friends, of which girls are absent from this film altogether which doesn't make sense. jesper ganslandt makes his directorial debut and co wrote the film along with the cinematographer, of which i use the term loosely, fredrik wenzel. the acting isn't too bad. i would give this a 4.5 out of 10 but despite it's submission for consideration for the academy awards i would not recommend it.

this is an admirable attempt from first time filmmaker ham tran, offering little-glanced perspective dealing with vietnam war victims struggling for liberation, but plays out as a glorified history special. with clunky, self-consciously informative dialog and sub-par acting, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not spring to life this sagging, albeit historically worthy, melodrama. paying no mind to the often distracting disconnect with the actors to the reality of situations on screen, and you should be left with an informative, if somewhat impersonal educational lesson in vietnamese post-war history.

(chances are, i'm gonna spoil valuable plot points while writing this and because i can't determine and don't really care what you think is a valuable plot point, then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things, then i suggest you hop right on to the next review.) you know, i don't mind the cult films being filed under the "cult" section. and people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the "reality". i mean, is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo-christian propaganda films be filed with the other special interest movies? i couldn't have been more flabbergasted had pat robertson made a porn movie. (or would that be "flubbergasted"?) it was bad enough that there was an egregiously insufficient count of kicking and punching in this. it was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways. it was bad enough that it wasn't filed under special interest, with other cult films. it was bad enough that it somehow is receiving nods for being "realistic" as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the "debbil" and the really profound and nasty evil isn't done by human beings -- usually in the name of religions based on the god of abraham. it was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was awful.no, the really bad part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off, and declared "i for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now, just to get that out of my head. preferably both, if you have it." and we had just met her.

my friends and i are always on the lookout for chuck norris films to just bash and make fun of. one of our favorites so far is lonewolf. i went to a wal-mart christmas shopping and i came across this movie in the 5.99 bin. i had to get it. i had high hopes for this movie and although being absolutely hilarious at times, we agreed that bells of innocence is the worst movie we've ever seen, made, produced, thought up, etc... who the hell would think this is a good idea. not only is it confusing at times, but the acting is just hard to watch. the man who plays oren has acting i can compare to my own vomit, and chuck took a dive on this one, he's not the greatest actor, but this was terrible. and what kind of names are oren, conrad and jux........ jux. come on people. if you honestly thought this movie was at all watchable, great for you because it was hard for me and i seriously had a headache and stomach pains after watching it. i'm telling you now if you haven't seen this movie, don't!!. for the love of god please do not subject yourself to such a horrible 90 minutes of your life.

this is another one of those fundamentalist christian movies that hit you over the head with religion like a sledgehammer. you know you are in trouble when the setup of the story is completely ridiculous. three men are flying to mexico to deliver bibles. this makes no sense since the church is protestant and most mexicans are catholic. protestant and catholic bibles are not the same. the catholic bible has books in it that are not in the protestant bible. i also find it difficult to believe that churches in mexico would not distribute bibles to them. i can understand if they were going to a place where christianity is in the minority. but mexico is far fetched. if you cannot believe the setup of a story, then you don't the rest of the story either. a movie about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.

boring, rank nefarious plot, some of the worst direction i've ever come across, inane acting and horribly clichéd. the movie ends with one of the main characters waking from a dream. what's with that? even jr from dallas couldn't survive that lame twist. you have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a young girl, which is ostensibly meant to be fatherly, but which comes off as perverse. you have freshman community college movie school special effects with loopholes the size of the kimberly hole. this is like children of the corn meets passion of the christ imposed on an endless loop of government administration training video - by the end of it, if you aren't contemplating ending it, you have no brain.don't bother.

when you watch the making of with this dvd - they tell you what is attempted here- they are retelling the bible story of good versus evil & trying to preach it to a main stream movie audience. in a modern society such as ours, this is where the film fails. there are way too many sheep depicted in this movie. people are too empowered for this type of preaching today.as far as the acting, directing, & technical functions, they are done ok. chuck norris actually is ok as an angel as the unpredictable appearance of norris as an angel is no more absurd than tommy smothers was in the 1960's sit com.

ok, chuck norris has shown up in many an entertaining movie over the years. this is not one of them. i won't even bother trying to get into the plot about a bible shipment gone wrong. the "acting" of the main characters is so wood like, pinocchio would have done a better job! the synthesizer based soundtrack is even worse than the one in deathstalker. whereas traditionally low budget spooky movies are often trying to catch their audience by adding plenty of graphic violence, this one is trying to catch an audience by throwing religious mambo jumbo at the spectator. the plot boils down to different versions of the bible.

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. what were they thinking. stop preaching to me already! this is why all of us watch walker texas ranger and wont admit it to our friends. terrible acting and a extremely phony plot. while the movie is unfolding the story stops and the actors start preaching to the audience. the director somehow believed the two meshed well. it looked like crap! when i saw the title at my local blockbusters it looked interesting. their should have been a warning on it saying it was religious instead of the false advertisement of an action / adventure. first time in a long time i stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate finishing it.

normally, i don't like chuck norris films. i appreciate his work as a martial artist, and his fight scenes are usually fairly well-choreographed. chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats. so, in my local used bookstore, i found a film i hadn't seen before and took it home.while the acting in this movie was worse than most chuch norris films, i was hoping to see at least one fight scene. i quickly began to realize that this wasn't a typical chuch norris film; rather it was a christian film, destined to illustrate the "good will win out" paradigm.there is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a christian film, with the exception of the label ... goodtimes entertainment, which i had never heard of before. i'll certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that company.i don't have a problem with christianity ... i do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing. if someone is going to make a religious film, at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get. the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only $3.25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight. at least it was during supper-time, and i spent some of that cooking and eating.in short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts film, and not hoping for much, don't bother with this film because it doesn't even offer that.

ok, i'm 26 so i've been thru all the action heroes 80's hype, and chuck norris along with seagal, van damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of bullets from one round only;) i saw the advert of this movie on tv a couple of days ago - chuck norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers. whoa! 'that is a must-see crappy movie!', i said. and indeed it was. only a lot lot worse. it is very difficult to see all the movie - stuffed with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, who serve satan, all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community, which represent whole mankind - it is a load of christian fundamentalist's wet dreams.i've nothing against christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense, c'mon, chuck norris playing an angel, whose job is to look after little town, where satan lives?!?! the whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not mentioning its silliness (yes, it's not stupidity anymore, we're talking silliness like... like a retarded child's joke) make altogether terrible movie, made as far as i suppose for elder people very much devoted to catholic church, because young viewers laugh at almost every scene. technically it's incorrect, the fx are worse than the ones you've seen in early 90's in tv series, the plot seems very stupid, actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands, not mentioning the music which as far as i've heard was played on a childish toy piano. i've seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (the ones from the imdb bottom list) like 'space mutiny' or 'manos - hands of fate' but believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly acted quasi-movie which brings some students' prank movies to my mind rather than regular production. avoid it. at all cost avoid it. there's even nothing to laugh at. chuck norris has officially finished his movie career.

i recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is chuck norris. this meant that i would have to do extensive chuck research, and find out as much as i could about the man. i later find out that he is not in fact a man, but an angel sent from heaven. with a face like that, who could ever doubt it? i have watched more chuck norris movies in the last four months than any one person should. i am proud to say that bells of innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list. i spent most of the film wondering if i could return my copy to the local wal-mart without the receipt, which i had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue. the biggest reason why i chose to purchase this film was that it not only had chuck in it, but his son mike. i was anxious to see if mike was a chip off the old can't-act-his-way-out-of-a-wet-paper-bag block. i came to the conclusion a long while ago; the chuck norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason. the only character he ever plays is himself, chuck norris. no matter what movie, no matter what situation, he is always chuck norris. the one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent. mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work. in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter, he seems to be extremely happy! maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic, as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time. his actions confused me throughout the film, making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was. the other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of norris. the guy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke, was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the direct-to-video screen. the only thing i remember him being in other than this movie, was an episode of walker texas ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. maybe chuck owes this guy something. the other guy, which is the only name i can think of because he was so forgettable, was your average christian fanatic. i don't have anything against christians, in fact i am one, but this guy was just too much for me. to round out the story, you have a multitude of townspeople who love to call people "friend", and a couple of villains who don't seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge. not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies. all in all, the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time, on more levels than chuck norris can kick people's asses. despite being one of the worst actors of all time, i still can't get enough of chuck. maybe he really was sent from heaven...

i have to agree with the other two comments. i waited over a month to see this great new show a&e had been hyping. what a disappointment!!! the show is pretty much all about ryan buell. his voice-overs are campy, not creepy. it sounds as if he is talking into a can. as of the second episode, which is roughly 30 minutes or so (if you take out the commercials) he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic. he can't say the name, anytime someone needs to convey that name, they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else. not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us. why can't he say the name?...supposedly it would give the demon more power. funny, i always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities. if you know the exact name of the demon, doesn't it make it easier for you to cast them out. now the next episode, which airs in just a little while is titled "exorcism". so is ryan in need of an exorcism already? not to say that it couldn't happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything. i can tell ryan that if i were a small child, hell if i was an adult, and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me, i would look elsewhere for help!!! besides which, if you don't use holy water & blessings, etc. in the right way don't you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you? i will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time i watch it!

i suppose i should be fair and point out that i don't believe in ghosts. that said, i'm very interested in the subject and i enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy. i am a fan of ghost hunters because they at least try to give their investigations a scientific angle. even early episodes of most haunted had a camp entertainment factor to them. paranormal state has neither of these qualities. the cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much "reality tv" these days, it suffers from overproduction, poor acting and silly scripts. the makers of the show freely admit that writers "guide" the stories. i hear they are even going to shoehorn in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female demographic. the show has many other flaws too. as others have stated, the narration quickly becomes like nails down a chalkboard. over the top visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating. i'm willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of entertainment, but this whole "demon with a vendetta" story arc is just ridiculous. given that the producers of this show are also responsible for brain dead fodder like mtv's laguna beach and newport harbor i suppose this is really no surprise. if you are a die hard fan of ed & lorraine warren or a big "reality" show junkie i guess you'll find much to like in paranormal state. for the rest of us....i recommend you avoid.

i am a pretty much a sucker for those ghost hunter shows. from the cheesy mockumentaries like discovery channel's "the haunting" to scooby doo reality shows like "ghost hunters". when i saw promos for a&e's "paranormal state" i knew i was going to watch. especially when "paranormal state" was juxtaposed against a weak monday night football game.by the end of the pilot of "paranormal state" when the main "character" in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he, too, had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that "came out of the closet" and the (catholic) church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot.the shtick behind "paranormal state" is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club. or society. or super adventure club. and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m. night shymalan movie.the "they" is kind of a misnomer. really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show. he is often accompanied on "investigations" by hot co-eds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera. hey, are they ghosts too? this is ryan buell's show. paranormal state is his "vehicle" as we like to say in the biz. and, oh, what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be.did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star date-less "director's log" voice over? almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas, but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs. seriously, every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game.the "investigations" -- the plot that each episode revolves around -- are interesting on the surface. no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in "paranormal state". this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear. small children are harassed, things loom in the dark, voices encourage the living to kill, and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands. of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent, nasty hauntings tied to violent, nasty deaths. maybe.maybe not. everything in "paranormal state" is short-handed into half hour, "dog the bounty -- er, ghost hunter" blocks. every time there is an interesting, verifiable shred of evidence -- the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s -- the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander. at least with sci-fi channel's "ghost hunters" there is a somewhat over-exhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer. evps that could be a rat farting, cold spots in a drafty house, and "orbs" that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust. it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes "ghost hunters" ... almost believable.whereas "paranormal state" claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio. yep, see, an evp, right? people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement... well, we will just go and see about that... while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room. ryan, the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates, is claiming to see "visions" of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting... but he can't tell us, the audience, or his team of gothed out undergrads, because... he can't. you never say a demon's name out loud, ryan informs the wide eyed co-ed who dare inquires.well, how very very convenient for you. especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind."paranormal state" is all turn and no prestige. the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people. not even grainy video of a chair moving, or a black blob running between prison cells. nothing. you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over.if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little. if you are trying to sway me, show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer. and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode."paranormal state" is weak sauce. not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time, or just have that thin of a dvd collection. or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water.

okay, sure, this film will never win an oscar. citizen cane this film is not... but why does every film have to be scrutinized? when was the last time you saw a film that was funny not becuase it was good, but because it was goofy? doesn't anyone remember roger corman, king of exploitation?well, i had fun. i liked the cheese. just go in not expecting to think, and prepare to throw popcorn at the screen.

like another ticket buyer i saw a nice cute poster about this film, it's five star review, and awards won. thought what the heck, let's by a ticket for myself and my two sons. bad idea. the movie was not a family film, it was gratuitous, and it contained nothing worth watching.

why???? what a disgusting joke of a supposed movie...from the poster it looked like a cute movie.. what a disappointment.. who the heck is the male lead? he looks like an old retarded retired reject cop... i am a cop and i can tell.. the man can't act... go back to being a cop..no screen presence.. why did they show his bare ass so, as if he is mel gibson,, hell no... put the filmmaker out of business.. this guy has no business making a movie... i seriously doubt women or gay men find him attractive... whoever cast the film is a no talent hack who cast no talent hacks in the lead.. it's great that us white guys are alway getting the asian women but why an ugly white guy why not dean cain or brad pitt as the white boyfriend.. why to asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what i see??? don't get it.. must be low self esteem..the only hot girl who can act in the movie was the kate holliday..why was there one hot white chick among all the rest of the ugly asian chicks who think they are hot and can act???only two actors in this movie the host of the poetry at the end of the movie and the one hot white chick in the massage house.. tl young and kate holliday should have been the leads in the movie..the asia character was ridiculous looked like she was trying too hard to be some kind of ghetto/sexy black girl...key word here is "trying"..gina.. you can't act and you are not hot enough physically for this kind of role.. you need to play character roles and be more humble in your self presentation..i think the actress is gina hirazumi... i looked her up on the imdb and she is a great asian actress???? if that is the case i don't want to see what the bad asian american actresses are... no wonder hollywood doesn't have asian american actors!!! if this is the best they got!!! they were supposedly winning some kind of asian film award?? give me break...it looked like they just made a movie for the sake of putting a bunch of asian girls in them.. they aren't even hot..gina...you are not hot.. stop trying..play character roles and improve your acting..you are not a leading female type...if this movies makes money pigs can fly..sorry for being so blunt but i feel that these actors/ actresses need to either get better or work on their craft: for the exception of the two actors i mentioned who should have played the leads.. i say this in love for all the asian lead girls in the film please do what your parents say and go and be doctors/lawyers/and engineers...and do acting on the side for fun..hopefully that is what you are doing now.. i am not trying to be mean but hoping this will be read and push you people to either get better or go do another business.. there was not even a message ethically in this movie..i would not be surprised if "soap girls" was secretly funded by members of the ku klux klan special department of asian american hate propaganda of the klan.. otherwise asian people must hate themselves..seeing this film makes me as the viewer grateful that i am not asian..you folks are pathetic..have some self respect you asian people.

so this ugly guy with long, nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend. there was suppose to be something scary in it but i didn't see anything scary at all. there is some mention of a demon from the sea but that doesn't go anywhere at all. i wish it did because then it would've taken the tension away from the jealous love triangle. the title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie but it is so far from it that i couldn't believe it. i waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when it did. it did not live up to the title like it should have so boo hoo hoo. the cover had a cool picture but i shouldn't judge a cheesy movie by its cover.

how in the name of decency did this film ever get made? one presumes the subtitles merely say 'awful' on every single frame of this truly dismal effort.horrendous acting, woeful dialogue and the lack of talent from everyone involved in this nightmare make for an excruciating 90 minutes.overall impression? a bunch of excitable drama students got lucky with a lottery grant and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made.this makes hammer horror tv shows look like oscar material.and don't for a second think this falls into the 'so bad it's good' category. it's not even that bad.but the fart lighting scene is probably worth another look.

...and that's saying something. no matter how bad a movie gets, i'm normally able to sit through it so i can judge the full movie. through this one, i made it about 20 minutes.maybe it was the dvd, or maybe it was my laptop, but i could not hear the dialogue, even with the volume turned all the way up. sound effects were fine, so with the volume turned up to hear the dialogue, i was blowing out my eardrums with the effects. as much as i wanted to see this thing through, i wasn't going to sacrifice my hearing for it.from what little i could tell about the plot, the movie was one big flashback by the main character's daughter. it seems the mother, a military pilot, had to flee her ship because the one person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemy and now he is pursuing her across a desert planet.the only thing i liked about the movie was the look of the main character; there was something i liked about her hairstyle.oh well, looks like this one is going into the dumpster...

first i have to say that i don't like since fiction movies at all so much! but there are some movies i liked really. this is one of the others ;) i've the same opinion like some (most)others here. the film is still going on in my back, but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time....i think what they have done well are the animated sceneries with 3 suns and 4 moons, but its the only i liked. there are no intelligent dialogs (are there???). but its a great film for everybody who loves lara croft or some other girls in hot-pants... ;)for the directors: " stop to try again, please!!! "

i'd never heard of zero budget "auteur" neil johnson before seeing "battlespace" on dvd at hollywood video. a few minutes into the movie i realize this isn't a bad thing. like many straight to video sci-fi movies, this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that fail to create a story.viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter. to me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with militantly ugly visuals and zero character emphasis. some people on here seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed it's seemingly new age messages hook line and sinker. these favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like "battlefield earth" was a brilliant movie, or that shasta is just as good as coke.those who were lured in by the cheesy cover art can look forward to lousy acting (in small doses, spaced with long blocks of people not talking), rotten computer animated effects (in extra large doses), and irritating talking computers. what you won't get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue, or a good story."battlespace" is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it. real science fiction, hell, real film-making, is about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and dull predictions. this is right down there with similar direct to video sci-fi like "cl.one" and "recon 2022". if the boredom of "strange horizons" and "alien visitor" is something you seek out, by all means, watch the crap out of this. if you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.

i watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. so, i fast forward all the way through the end. this movie must be the worst of all in the low budget sci-fi movies category so far. bad acting, cast, directions, lara craft custom imitation, story, plot, everything! through out the entire movie, i think that there maybe only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast, but only two of them started in the entire movie. i was expecting something like the starship trooper, but it was nothing close to it. i was fooled by the movie title and the picture on the dvd cover. don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. come to think of it, i wonder why did they even bother to put out bad movies like this one?

i have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film. no plot, very limited action, and what is with the 3rd person commentary throughout the film???? instead of running around the planet to shoot on all of these locations, they should have spent some money on script writing and actors. what acting there was, was lousy. this was 90 minutes of my life i will never be able to get back. i should bill the director for the cost of renting this film. to the director and the writers of this film....please quit now. this film should have a tag on the front of it saying beware of boredom. the only good thing i can say about this film, is the computer generation. it's ok as generation is. this movie should never have a sequel....ever.

this movie was rented for free, i had no misconception about this being a very bad movie. i rented it for thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches an awful movie. so you ask, what makes this movie so bad you gave it only 2 stars? dialog. the lack of dialog makes this a movie perfect for a deaf audience. in fact if you rent this, just turn the volume down to zero and pop in any heavy metal cd from your favorite artist. i know you will enjoy it better. the plot of this holiday turkey was so encumbered with tech and geek speak you need a translator for the narrative. now for all you people who enjoy good sci-fi effects... eh, they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in cases worse. the actors, um both of them, are not much to look at either. they say nothing much through out the entire movie. many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the hero straps herself to a missile and fires it at the city 70km away (it never showed how she landed). the scene before that we see a robotic sentry fire at her with a cannon from 12 feet away and he misses multiple shots. also we are told that the political division between the antagonist and protagonist is bio-tech (genetically enhanced humans) vs cyber-tech (machine enhanced humans) but both seem to be cyborgs or enhanced humans. what told me this was a bad movie at the rental store was the cover that looked like a video game cover art and there was only the one copy, good new releases have many copies available.

i knew it would be a bad movie when i rented it but i hoped for a good bad movie. oh well, had fun making fun of the endless sand trudging, eating camel dung (well, actually eggplant) and weird grimacing acting from i think it was about five actors. the dvd needs a director's commentary so that i can find out what he was thinking...or if he was at all. i can't believe they actually went to england, austrialia and wherever to film this...could have been done anywhere. would have been better if they had managed to get her naked. the best line of the movie? "he waiting for his upgrades." "yup, still waiting". now that was funny! if anyone had more than 3 pages of dialog (beyond the narrator....shut up already) then i'll watch it again.

the film begins with a 30 minute explanation about the war, the human cyborgs, battles, history, and then dumps 2 actors into a gravel pit. they run around this gravel pit/desert area for about an hour shooting at each other. that's it. must have cost about £10.00 to make, with change. avoid.marks out of ten: acting -9 sets 1 costumes -9 direction -50 production 1 titled intro 4i think to improve this film would be to: lose the commentary. (let the watcher decide what's going on). remove some of the awful cgi. add some techno rave music to it. they might just rescue it.......

ok, please believe me when i say that this is a terrible, terrible, sci-fi movie. its done so poorly that much of the film plays out as unintentional surrealism and its absolutely a 100% waste of time. awful, but somehow also deeply unfunny. i watched this as a double feature with "recon 2020: the caprini massacre" and although "battlespace" was an incredibly superior film, that's not saying much. the plot of "battlespace" is so completely convoluted that its impossible to follow. the narration is cryptic, often nonsensical, seemingly endless, and thoroughly exhausting. literally half the film is duplicative scenes of the female lead, who looks like brian bosworth, walking through the desert. the movie actually starts out pretty cool, but then nosedives into pooptown and somehow continues to deteriorate, minute by minute. absolutely horrible and truly an absurdist endurance test. zero stars. ---|--- reviews by flak magnet

let me break down this film for you...the first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects. i'm not one to nitpick about special effects, but what you've got to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, you shouldn't anchor your film around special effects. starships fire blobs of color at each other, flaring into stock explosions, and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers. you will have no idea what is happening. it will not make sense.the second act involves a woman walking in the desert. at this point you will be treated to drab scenery, and illogical, boring fight scenes. nobody speaks. nothing interesting happens. the protagonist's goals are unclear, and are not very compelling. this goes on for about 45 minutes.then in a five-minute montage, she sneaks into an enemy base, straps herself to a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails, and dies.none of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film.in the last twenty minutes, basically the chick's memories get transferred to her daughter, who goes into stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of mankind. after this, we see the first, and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. you know. because when the universe is collapsing, you get to decide if you want to be a part of it.she chooses yes. but the memories of mankind survive in a capsule. maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh? if you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. the lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old wind-up toy capable of staying right-side-up while walking through sand. all of the story is told through painfully dull narration.the film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science-fiction ideas. there are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films, but as it stands, it's bloated with completely irrelevant details. two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second montage. instead, the narrator fills in a novella's worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters.there are good ideas in here, but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained. people watched films to be entertained. this film does not entertain.

in a world where humans can live forever you spend the entire movie wishing they would die. first off if you insist on watching this movie do two things first put it on mute, don't worry you miss a plot, hell they don't even talk for the first 70 min of an 87 min movie, after putting on mute you must now hit fast forward till the main chick dies don't worry even if your paying attention you won't know why or how she died. once you get to the "good part" take it of mute. oh, how will you know the good part, wait for an elevator scene with two morons in space suits with wwii weapons. these weapons won't seem like much till you realize that the first protagonist had a laser tag pistol and a bandoleer of co2 cartridges. the only remnants of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi hot chick who looks like she was attacked by wolverine. after listening to the "plot", you will wish they went back to not talking. of the four people that are in this movie none of them can remotely act, not even a little bit, you will have better luck witnessing acting at a kindergarten theater.to comment on the special on the special effects, let me just say "wow", no really you will spend the entire movie saying to your self "where did this movie's 1.8 million dollar budget go!" seriously it will leave you in aw of the magnitude of ineptness. the best "sets" are basically windows wallpaper backgrounds. the ships are basically flying wrenches, wait some are barges that kinda look like whales . i have never heard so many made up words in my whole life. they have buttons on their wrist(large pedometers) that can put them in "fight mode" and super runing mode (makes them super blurry). this will seriously drain their power reserves but they find bits of wires to chew on to regain their strength. the explosions were less impressive than my fourth of july, i only had sparklers.so the plot as far as i can figure goes something like this "mother" is a space ship captain and goes to the desert for a while rides a rocket dies. then her daughter 6000 years in the future ( no i am not exaggerating) recalls her mother's memories through some sort of capsule. anyways they jabber on for another 10 min and then the cause a big bang. yes the same "big bang" that started our solar system. it's explained how she goes back in time or something, it does not really matter it happened i guess. roll credits seriously the whole script was mercifully on one sheet of paper, unless that actually detailed any of the dreadfully fight scenes.after watching the credits i have now laughed more than i did the entire movie, the jobs the created like catering supervisor "galactius sarcophagus" and then the special thanks to george lucas was just the best.i really wasn't expecting that much for a movie i paid 99 cents for but seriously some body owes me for this. most frequent comment heard after the movie "i want my life back". you have to admire that some but put time and effort in to this movie but seriously, why ?

you see a movie titled 'battlespace', what are you going to think? space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other. what do you get with this movie? well, you do get some space battle goodness, but for a great majority of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing. no one talks!!!! what is this nonsense?! we get a narrators, and a ton of british computers, but thats about it. the main protagonist must be the worst one i have ever seen, as she doesn't even have any dialog, and sleepwalks though scenes (literately!). some of the things happening are just stupid, like they use a rocket (like to go to space) for basic transportation planet side, why not just use one of those nifty space ships? in any case, the music is almost non-existent, with a few boring dull lifeless samples, but the main thing you will notice is the atari sound effects the ships use...you have got to be kidding me. i can also tell that the budget was low, because everything looks fake, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie. i seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits it is so bad, making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is. i am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had, because their is very little here (if you can't tell already that is my main gripe here, as i probably said that like 3 times already).

today i had a real craving for a sci-fi movie and so i decided to check out battlespace. sadly, that was one of my biggest mistakes this year.i see that the director, neil johnson, has directed over 500 music videos, and i suggest he goes back to that. music videos are a perfectly good form of entertainment, and not everybody can cut it making movies.the worst part of this movie is probably the voice over. and that says a lot since the special effects are appalling at times. voice over didn't work in blade runner, and it doesn't work here. the first hour or so is spent watching the main character walk through the desert, while her daughter tells the story. i think the story could have made a great movie, but not like this.the second worst part are the effects. they are simply bad and they don't blend into the rest of the picture at all, so you simply don't believe in them. and absolutely all the frames in the movie has been filtered, and not in a good way. filtering used as an effect is good. 90 minutes of it, bad.and what is it with all the gadgets talking all the time, and not shutting up!?!? if i had used technology like that i would have gone mad. i was just waiting for the guns to blurt out with: "i am awfully sorry, but i seem to have run out of ammunition." no, stay away. this movie is just not worth the time.

i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci-fi movie, but this was almost intolerable. while a few of the special effects are very cool (landscapes) this is no 'battlespace' rather a disjointed weird mother/daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts thrown in. the acting (wooden), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and with "hand-to-hand" combat scenes funnier than any hong kong chopsocky movie, this film bores. the plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator), unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea. save your love of sci-fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here.

i made it through half of this, but was not enough of a masochist to see it all. the first half of the film had next to no dialog ! almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story. the scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennium of detailed history in the voice over. at the same time he forgot to do any character development. most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet together ended up fighting each other. there are some good things going on in the film. the soundtrack was well done. some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.

so it's a space movie. but it's low budget. you ask, "what about the effects?" the effects are at times good, and at times really, really bad. i mean bad. and notice i started with the effects.there's a story here, but it's told in what i think is the wrong order. i don't mean a tarantino style wrong order. i mean, it's told in a completely nonsensical arrangement. most of it's about a mother (in the future, because you know, it's sci-fi) as told by her daughter, which is mostly exposition done in narrative from the daughter's perspective. only once you're through the first hour and hear paul darrow's voice as a computer do you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if he'd read it. this narrative is so constant and inclusive, that the actors on screen hardly say a word for the first hour.there's also a lesson here for you up and coming filmmakers: if you're not doing 2001 and want to have some action (this one does), then please hire a good fight choreographer. otherwise, your fights will look like, well, what's in battlespace. and notice the title has the word "battle" in it. ugh.i think this might be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. and some effects. my biggest surprise is seeing the imdb listing this film as costing $1.8 million. when you compare it to something like primer, which did better with a budget of a few thousand, you realize in low budget film-making, it's all about the story. i wasn't expecting much - but i was still disappointed. two out of ten stars.

normally,i would say i loved this movie.not for acting,although that was ok.not for the script,which was so-so.the reason i would have normally loved this movie is for the intense action,which starts from the get go and doesn't end until the final credits roll.but,the problem with this movie,and i felt it was a big problem,was the horrible cgi.it looks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the the effects shots. a lot of the effects look lime they are in their very roughest form.since it is obvious they didn't have enough money to finish the movie,they should not have released it.i actual found the effects insulting.it seems obvious they didn't care about making a decent end product for the consumer.if it weren't for that,i would give this movie a much higher rating.my vote for air panic is a 3/10

it amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this. really. let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a single hint of originality... most of the movies today are based on other movies' stories, so a "simple" lack of originality is not that big a deal. but i can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this. because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. to be sincere i think a 6-years-old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable. some examples following.the scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. when they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like "ok, push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard". now, those are not buttons. they should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot. that's something only plane-addicted would know, you say? wrong. the next scene you can see their fingers pushing the "buttons"... and of course the so called "buttons" don't move at all! not even a single millimeter! (and note that i haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine, that you just turn the key and the magic happens... you have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on...) come on guys! you could have faked the movements at least!! not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway (light poles along the runway? what where they thinking?!)... and the wings don't even get ripped off! it happened to me too, once... except the plane was made of lego! what about the flight attendant? she's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are, in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. should we mention, then, the guy that can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? and how did he turn the other airplane engines on?really, i could go on hours with this stuff. this is the dumbest movie i've ever come across, and i'm including garbage like alone in the dark and other stuff in the list. want to do yourself a favor? don't watch it.

i rented this movie because i love kristanna loken and i've watched her on many tv shows and since she's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new t3 movie i wanted to check out what other movies she has been in.she's just ok in terms of acting. not good and not bad either. she makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous. yummmmmrodney rowland was quite a surprise as the hero. he provided the only solid good acting in the movie. he's a very good actor and should probably be an action star.besides kristanna being ok and rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its purest form.a computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant ..... or something. and of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game.this is one of the worst scripts i have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flick.what's shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has way too many similarities to the september 11th tragedies.why do they make movies like this in the first place?panic * - one star (a waste of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as air panic)

it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie. i have to say it is really hard to make a good and/or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money. also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus. first, the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit, second you got a stick, third using computers to control rudders/elevators/aileron via "fly by wire". when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was "don't fly with computerized airplanes like airbus, use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and rudders."all i can say: bad story, horrible acting (most of the actors), worst film trick ever...

this movie has every cliché of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie.however, it is not entirely unwatchable, thanks to good performances by rowland, loken and smallwood (and maybe enberg).what is amazingly bad, though, is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes. boy, oh boy, the cgi scenes in "the last starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). the feeling of cheepnis really sends shivers down your spine.a pity, this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.

it`s funny how instinct warns you of something . for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was . maybe i`m psychic ?!!!! mild spoilers !!!!the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . i don`t know about you but i`m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it`s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? yeah he`s a serious badass mofo . in fact he`s so bad ( and i don`t mean the acting - i`ll get to that in a moment ) that he`s impossible to take seriously and this is before he`s executed only to return as elton john , elvis , a french chef etc . i wonder if keith david got paid for this ? because he looks lke he`s having so much fun on screen that`s the only reason he`s playing the role . what a pity this reviewer didn`t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury . hey maybe the producers could send me keith`s fee ? gawd only knows i deserve it.i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn`t guessed and my main beef isn`t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . if like me you`ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you`ll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but judge and jury will have you believe that if you`re thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you`ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs . it could of course be argued that any film starring sly , arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain

honestly, buying this movie was a waste of money. it's one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life. the only part i liked is the ending, but it's so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie.

it's nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role here--something she hadn't done in awhile--but her character of judith(wise they didn't try to pass her off as a 'judy')has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore, and andrews enacts 'grown-up' as any other actress would interpret frigid. it's a surprisingly bland drama set in barbados involving omar sharif(not the liveliest leading man around--not even in 1974!)hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom. unmemorable outing does have some camp value: the james bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot. as for julie: she's quiet and contemplative, but that doesn't do much for the audience, or for the film. blake edwards paces the freakin' thing like a funeral. * from ****

you know that this film is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the support role played by arnold schwarzenegger. while this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn't the best actor, compared to brigitte nielsen, he's sir john gielgud. in fact, this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive football player, mark gastineau. so, instead of this being her "break out film", this and a beverly hills cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one-note career. it was obvious, too, that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well, because the supporting cast (aside from arnold) is pretty lame and the script is dull, dull, dull. fans looking for another conan movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film.

corny and some really bad acting but for a golan-globus film about right on par. saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and sorcery films(what was i thinking?). arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world.brigitte nielsen is the title character who at the time was sly's girl and a pretty bad actress.movie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies. brigitte cheeses it up as sonya and arnold acts wooden as lord kalidor.there is also sandahl bergman(who was in the original conan movie as valeria)here she plays the evil queen gedren,an obvious camp to her conan role. and then one of the most irritating child actors onscreen(ernie reyes)as prince tarn who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed.what a little irritating scut. some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks. special effects are cheap and look very 70's ,like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie. overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness.

after a long hard night being partied away at the walkabout in islington, i needed a pick-me-up. my throat hurt, my wallet was empty and i ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus-stop trying to sell me some petrol. today, i watched "red sonja" and i can honestly say that i felt much better last night than i do right now. brigitte nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. yep, it's that good."red sonja" isn't in a genre known for great films until peter jackson came along with a certain oscar-winning trilogy. in fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film i could think of before "lord of the rings" was george lucas's kiddie-friendly "willow". perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. but i can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of paul smith, who's just average) and dreadfully put together. the film is as convincing as an episode of the flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta bedrock. considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. why sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. his personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "the terminator".it's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. when nielsen mourns the death of her sister and schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive germanic accent, "she's dead" then you know you're in for a rough ride. a few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. if you have to watch an eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch "willow" (but never take that as a ringing endorsement). for the real thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show peter jackson what a great job he did with "lord of the rings". trust me, 11 oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody "titanic".

possible spoilers as peter jackson has so brilliantly shown in his `lord of the rings' trilogy, it is quite possible to make good films, even great ones, within the heroic fantasy genre. the genre has distinguished literary antecedents, dating back to the mediaeval chivalric romances, particularly the arthurian legends, upon which tolkien and other authors have drawn. `lord of the rings' apart, however, it is difficult to think of any other sword-and-sorcery films which are any good. i would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was ron howard's `willow', and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one. `red sonja', however, cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one.as with `willow', many of the plot-elements in `red sonja' are derived from `the lord of the rings'. an evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination, but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes. the film, set in the hyborian age, a barbaric era in the earth's remote past, starts with the villain of the piece, the wicked queen gedren, making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine sonja. when these are rebuffed, gedren (not a woman to take no for an answer) reacts by murdering sonja's parents and brother. (in 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust).gedren's next move is to capture the talisman, a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, by slaughtering the whole of the scantily-dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it, just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous. among the dead is sonja's sister, her sole surviving relative. sonja herself, however, has not been idle, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude, and sets out to avenge herself. along the way she teams up with kalidor, a heroic wandering swordsman-king resembling tolkien's aragorn, prince tarn, the spoilt child-ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to gedren's powers, and falkon, tarn's loyal servant. the rest of the film is fairly predictable, as sonja and her allies try to overthrow gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control talisman.just what is it that makes this film so bad? well, the acting, for a start. arnold schwarzenegger as kalidor gives the sort of typical wooden, poker-faced performance that became his trademark, at least in the early part of his career, complete with heavy foreign accent. compared with brigitte nielsen as the heroine, however, he looks like laurence olivier. miss nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties, delivering every line in the mechanical, toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a `teach-yourself-english-by-correspondence' course. one wonders if she was hired for the role just to make arnie look good by comparison. the other characters, while not conducting their own private struggles against the english language, are simply cartoonish caricatures, especially prince tarn who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever.an even worse fault than the bad acting, however, is the film's almost complete lack of imagination. this is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film, as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot. when we watch peter jackson's masterpiece we can persuade ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in middle-earth, that elves, wizards and hobbits do exist, and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring. when we watch `red sonja' we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime-green football.this lack of imagination even starts with the film's title. the british science-fiction author brian aldiss, when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero joe. (admittedly, tolkien was ableto get away with giving the name sam to one of his main characters, but that was because hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar, the middle-earth equivalent of tweedy, pipe-smoking englishmen). similarly, giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long-gone barbaric age a common girls' name like `sonia' (which is how the name `sonja' is pronounced) is about as appropriate as calling her `betty' or `mary-jane'.the film seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they bothered at all. fantasy needs to be done convincingly, or not at all. it was obviously shot in a remote mountain area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture. the few buildings we see, such as the temple of the talisman or gedren's palace, are obviously cheap sets. we learn that tarn's capital city has been destroyed by gedren using the power of the talisman, but we do not actually see this event; all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill. at first you wonder how sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies, but when you see how small an army gedren has at her disposal it becomes more understandable. when an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if this is the talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set. if we can enjoy this film for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour; a fine example of the so-bad-it's-funny school of filmmaking. ed wood would have been proud of this one. if it had been shown on californian television the night before the recall election, gray davis would still be governor. 2/10.

i remember the trailer for this infamously weak spin-off of conan. i saw the movie years later and laughed my head off. unintentionally! poor briggite nielson. her career never had a chance thanks to cobra and red sonja. the plot of the movie is this: sonja(brigitte nielson) hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen gedren(sandahl bergman). queen gedren steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by. sonja goes on a hunt for queen gedren and later finds out that gedren killed her parents. on her quest she reluctantly joins kalidor(arnold schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named tarn(ernie reyes jr.) and his bumbling idiotic servant, falkon(paul l. smith). together they go on a hunt for queen gedren and the orb. the acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. i mean briggite neilson looks so emotionally distant. for someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades, sonja doesn't look fazed at all. arnold is playing his usual stoic role and ernie reyes jr.... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! the moronic manservant falkon had more personality than these guys. the action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat. the scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my ribs ached. the dialog is a hoot also. its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with. i can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy. anyone else don't bother.

honestly, this movie is weak. very weak. only capital character can something. she's work like supercharger on bad engine...so, if you like red-haired valkyries - see that. but better find picture of brigitte as sonja and put it on desktop. it will save of disappointments. well, arnold also do his deal...but it definitely not best his role. other characters - bad is not that word. sword fights? monsters? ridiculous. plot is really shame. why was necessary rape she? especially, we don't see it.anyway movie is weak. though worse movies exist...without main characters it would be just ******. and if somebody even discusses it, maybe...

okay, i admit i like brigitte neilsen in an unhealthy way, i just have a thing for 6' tall women with swords. there i said it.what's wrong with the movie? just about every mistake you can make was made. you take a successful movie series (conan) and you drag it through the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects, and the worst thing of all...you put a cute kid in there for comic relief. this kind of thing almost killed the indiana jones series ya know. cute kids are for disney movies, not real movies. neilsen at least took the movie seriously, even though it seems nobody else did. the plot had schwarzenegger repeatedly pulling red sonja's fat out of the fire and that undercut her character considerably. a warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess, thats her job! to not re-use the conan character in this movie was a crime. kalidor? sheesh. the movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy, unlike conan the barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully. when it comes to fantasy movies, its okay to have cheesy costumes, its okay to have harryhausen style animation, its okay to have silly exorbitant sets that make no sense, but to have a horrible script is unforgivable.this movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old.

recap: since the warrior queen gedren raised and slaughtered most of sonja's family, she has trained in the art of sword fighting. now, gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed, killing sonja's sister in the process. now sonja is out for revenge, and to save the world. along the way, she meets the very conan-like (but not conan, no!) kalidor, the child-prince tarn and his bodyguard falcon. at first sonja declines all help, but is later forced to accept it, and together they go to save the world.comments: when you watch a movie like this, and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. it is simple, and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense. it is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, sonja and kalidor, has no chemistry at all. and the kid is just annoying. and most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring. though the movie is not very long, it has not material enough to fill its time. and so back to point 1). the fighting is slow, uneventful and really bad. it clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike. in my honest opinion, i believe most kids, fighting with sticks, creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did. all in all, this is a really bad spin-off, that should be avoided by all who liked the conan-movies.2/10

... when dubbed into another language. let's face it: neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog. and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose-loose situation. any type of voice-over is sure to be an improvement (and it actually is - at least in the german version).but that is only a minor point. the acting is bad. the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic. nielsen couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag. this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid (who has had some martial arts training, no doubt) and to the athleticism shown off by sandahl bergman.schwarzenegger does his conan thing - nothing new here.some of the visuals are nice, i'll have to grant that. the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. but more often than not the plaster is all too evident.overall the movie isn't worth seeing. even 'conan the destroyer' is better than this (although only marginally). i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be, but i doubt that that could have saved this movie - oh well.3/10

this film was released soon after the conan films, a sort of female conan, red sonja played by sylvester stallones ex-wife brigitte nielsen. she's not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in rocky iv and cobra. the whole film feels cheap, but strangely arnold swarzenegger appears in this film but not as conan, although he looks, acts and fights like conan from the two conan films, i don't know what thats about. anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't hang around for long. maybe arnold filmed this in his time off from filming conan the destroyer or something? anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film, skip this and watch conan the barbarian instead.

this, in my opinion, is a very poor movie that advertises arnold schwarzenegger as starring (despite him being the co-star) only to sell more copies. obviously taking influence from the similarly themed conan' movies, this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all.bridgette neilsen stars as sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged, her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of queen gedran (sandahl bergman). gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by sonja's sister to do it. after discovering what has happened sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of gedran. kalidor (schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not.the first major problem with this movie is the beginning. the events leading up to the point where sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film. however, the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one-minute `previously on.' segment from a television show. had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't (i wonder why director richard fleischer has only currently directed two movies since red sonja).this film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like tarn (ernie reyes jr.) who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie, which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably. he was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for red sonja'.for all it's faults there were some good fight scenes involving both neilsen and arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey. the acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even arnie didn't seem too bothered about his performance. i don't recommend this film at all; to me it's a waste of an hour and a half. my rating for red sonja'  3/10

i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies, but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that. you will be thinking, man the conan movies were pretty cool...this one is totally boring and sucks. the story, who cares? it isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film. arnold, doesn't look like he belongs in this one, why he agreed to play the role is beyond me. well probably for the money. i just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. lame! this movie is just plain and simply terrible.

i watched this movie, or part of it, in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly. for one you have the worst acting ever! the lead "actress" birgitte nielsen is terrible, uninspired and hardly even attractive. and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt, but she does. and whats with the feminist attitude, it's plain hypocrisy. for one her family was killed by a women, then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men. she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king, whose city was destroyed by gedren. those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create. after this i could not take any more of nielsen painful acting, and the stupid clichés and lack of some real action.schwarzenegger as kalidor was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable. i liked the conan movie, but this is pure crap!

top gun without the in-house animosity. or class. or money. or cruise. an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next-big-thing actors to market their ability to lead a matinée this doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth into. it's a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece. barking.dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine, particularly the action sequences. michael biehn is a first-class action hero but not a leading man: charlie sheen is, to all intents and purposes, the leading man but never quite an action hero. there's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy. 3/10

the contemporary chapter of the u.s. navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do.... whatever they want, apparently.charlie sheen was made an officer. already the storyline is unbelievable. michael biehn is his immediate c.o., but he keeps charlie on a rather long leash and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to charlie's patented stupidity. the rest of the team spends their spare time committing courts-martial offenses. mostly an exercise in random gunfire and paper-thin ethics, these particular seals might be better suited to serving as crash-test dummies.some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings.

someone commented that charlie sheen's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted. you may be right, but that is how seal's truly are. i served for several months with a seal team out of norfolk, va. actually, i should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around europe for a couple of months. i was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail. since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person. each day a different seal would come up pretending to be someone else. well, after the third time i said no to them until i had proof who they were. they went nuts!!! i thought they were gonna bust through my cage, gag me, and then steal the mail. luckily i had not only the president on my side (the navy), but the federal government (us mail). that was the only time i saw the seals stopped from having whatever they wanted. they were allowed unlimited shore leave, where we had to be back on ship at a certain time. they killed and tortured a woman in france and the two seal's only got a 1 week detention on ship, whereas a seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a french wine shop and he got a court martial. is it any wonder why the seal's retention rate is over 85%? as a seal you are god. so this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a seal acts and thinks... unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake.

oh, man, i hated this movie. granted, the site locations were great, but that's about the only positive thing i can say about it. now, i'm going to state right at the beginning that i am very critical of the way weapons, especially firearms, are both portrayed, and handled, in movies. being a war flick, portrayal was fine, but the shoddy weapons handling in the movie would have never been tolerated by a real seal team. the acting was more wooden than my first sailboat, the equipment carried (or lack of it) was laughable, and the dialogue was, shall we say, lacking in anything interesting. well, with the exception of the journalist, which was actually prescient. watching this movie was comparable to watching "palmetto" with woody harrelson, where each scene was so bad you just couldn't turn it off, because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. like palmetto, they certainly did. the scene in the water, where, after shooting the first of the enemy, they blow the damn boat up, thereby having to face possible drowning, made me laugh so hard, that for a millisecond, i almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for. then charlie sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy down to the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the many camera cuts, it looked like they went down about 80 feet. nice continuity there....) before slashing his throat was so damn stupid, i was stunned. then again, so was the whole damn movie. i enjoy action movies, but not this one. note: the version i watched was a tv version, pan & scan. i can't imagine that made a difference, except for making the whole thing blessedly shorter!

i learned little of significance from this film that i did not already know from cnn and the new york times. (and i did not follow the enron case obsessively as did some others.) the film did a very poor job of explaining what "business" enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by andy fastow. it also significantly underplayed the role played by arthur andersen and vinson & elkins in validating practices that were afterwards found to be illegal. nor did it go as far as it might have in exploring what the "investors" -- all those prominent bankers -- thought they were doing. with the 24 hour a day cable networks, the discovery channel and the history channel, documentaries have proliferated. i've seen many in the past year that were better than this one.

as a ca resident, i'd like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too. i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. while they stuck to how enron rose and crashed, i found it really interesting. however, when the movie focused on it's anti-bush slant, it made me wonder if they were really being accurate. it's fine to point out any connection the republicans had to enron, but the monster was created while clinton was president. the ca energy crisis happened under davis's watch. both were in office during enron's abuses, but neither are held accountable in any way. rather, many minutes are spent on how bush was friends with lay. so what? lay played golf with clinton and spent the night in the lincoln bedroom. why are democrats given such a free pass in this film? i think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so i'm not partial to either party but i hate feeling like i'm subject to someone's political agenda when i watch a documentary. yes, politicians deserve some blame, but i really doubt that the only guilty one's have rs after their names. i found no value in portraying the bush's as kay-lovers when democrats received just as much enron campaign money as republicans did. like i said, it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out.

the movie opens with a scene that simply could not be. a man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed, he begin his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. morning blessings are recited, but only the ones gitai finds controversial. the rest are conveniently omitted. then while in philactories and a tallis he kisses his wife good morning!! this is not an accurate depiction of jewish prayer in any home, let alone a chassidic home. amos gittai is not interested in accurately portraying chassidic life. he is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films. the mikka (ritual bath) scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a chassidic wedding. i have many problems with the chassidic way of life, but i have no use for amos gittai's commentary on these issues. he would have you think that the chassidim are all dense comformists with severe bouts of depression. i may not agree with the chassidic lifestyle, but i acknowledge that chassidic life has many layers. amos gitai is blinded by his own secularist pseudo-intellectual stubborness and is therefore, incapable of portraying an accurate depiciton of chassidic life. aside from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of chassidic life, gitai fails in other aspects as well. the plot is full of holes, the dialogue loaded with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while at times powerfull was too often loaded with melodrama. the movie drags on and on and the ending is not worth sticking around for. watch if you must, but be warned. if you want to learn about chassidic life go to the communities and talk to chassidim. do not rely on gittai's film!

i don't know what chasidik movement was this film about?i saw this film a year ago.i am an orthodox woman, living in an orthodox chasidic? community and i can tell you i was offended by this movie!it's so far away from the reality, it's scary ! the director could at least hire a chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation, before making a "realistic" movie about ultra -orthodoxs! for example meir's davening (morning prayers)! or a jewish wedding, or a mikveh ( ritual bath ) customs.movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies..but it's not them that bothered me. it's the spiritual side. orthodoxs are portrayed next to taliban. woman are powerless, while men are the ultimate rulers ! please!no one can force a jewish girl to the chuppa against her will ! we ,orthodoxs,also, live by the law (halacha ) which clearly states man's responsibilities towards his wife.no beating and no raping,also!and no man ( even rabbi)is allowed to peak at the woman in the mikveh.and balanit is not to place a hand over woman's head,while she's taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse the whole body at one time! director was clearly trying to bash ultra orthodoxs ! but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated manner?love story? cute ! but not credible.dialogs are long and boring.the ending sucked totally.for all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending ,for all that sitting i felt i deserved it! obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness soothing movie for less observant jews, or for non- jews, perhaps..(look at those fundamentalist, they are so evil and mean...)and they succeed! long thing short: was hoping for a nice europien (kane level ) movie, got instead a tradition bashing, unrealistic,mistakenly guiding junk. i mean , today,we live in a time of a free will as never before. everyone has a right to choose. malka chose a rock singer.rivka made her choice.meir made his. many people from non observing backgrounds are choosing orthodox judaism these days.because,in this mad world religion might be a nice gateway !

my mother told me not to go to see "kadosh" -- but who ever listens to one's mother? i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater, so i checked with card-carrying feminists the next day. no, they also thought it was much more an anti-orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement, painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban.while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra-orthodox messianists, it is so nasty as to be unbelievable (plus that the non-fanatic orthodox rock-'n'-roller(!) one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy--even in israel that must be fantasy).the theater was quite crowded, so there's a pent-up curiosity to see israeli movies; too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution. this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies. (originally written 4/29/2000)

i saw the movie after checking its rating on imdb. back then, it was at 8.0 and i thought, "wow! that must be a good one". i thought wrong. the beginning of the movie actually keeps what the plot promises, but then it goes exponentially down underneath its basement. i think without the character of richie nix, it might have been alright - although he is the reason the story line takes the course it does. the character is just too extreme for my liking, and hard to endure. also, the journey the main character takes from the beginning of the story till its "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been omitted - the alternative is, i just did not understand the movie.although i must admit that it is "easy watching", and i had no problems sitting through the whole movie, when it had finished i was somewhat unimpressed by the ending. all in all, rather mediocre.

so, as far as i gather, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people, and this is just as scary as the paranormal. the "paranormal" imagery associated with the villain, donnie, is purely symbolic. he's actually just a normal human being.the problem is that i just don't buy it. donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal. he's not even that scary at all. as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has only newly become a murderer, he's significantly less disturbing than most well-known real-life serial killers (eg: he's like a very watered-down version of ed gein). which is why scully's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off (something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine), before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all, is completely out of character. she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches.so, as comic book guy says... "worst episode ever!"

here's what's good about "the slaughter rule:"--ryan gosling, clea duvall, and david morse all give great performances. gosling is, as always, pretty darn outstanding. the locales are often breathtaking.here's what's bad about "the slaughter rule:"--everything else. the script is horribly muddled. and while i can certainly appreciate a non-"feel good" movie, this movie is just boring. great performances can't make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make it sense. just getting through the first hour became a chore.i stuck with it because of gosling, but eventually i did myself a favor and changed the channel. spoilers on here relayed the ending to me. i didn't miss much. do yourself a favor--if you want a good gosling flick, check out "the believer."my score: 2 out of 10.

ok, so i saw this movie at this year's sundance, and i was sorely unimpressed. it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham-fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close-up of ryan gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. after the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watch-able albeit not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. the highlights certainly include both gosling and morse's acting, gosling being an up-and-coming star, and morse being an extremely well-established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. as a sidenote, after the screening i was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind me--he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject.

big disappointment. clash by night is much to talky and stagy and the dialog doesn't resonate as true coming from these characters. this is melodrama at its peak. the acting is truly over the top and very unreal. only marilyn monroe and keith andes as supporting players give this film any zip. wish they had more to do. i'm somebody who looks at details in films. two big questions...1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working, then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father? 2. when stanwyck is packing to leave town, why is she seen packing at her brothers place where she hasn't lived for at least two years? also, when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre, who's taking care of the baby again? such details really irritate me and cause me to give films much lower ratings. what were the writers, directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking? nuf' said.

i've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems, in the cruel light of 2007, a very sloppy late-rko assembly-line product. all that endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. the editing is downright careless: scenes just end, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. the dialog bears the stilted traces of the odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. but what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. i love stanwyck, but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. douglas, overplaying at being lovable, then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy, as is ryan, snarling and shouting most unnaturally. the less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: keith andes, whose character is kind of a neanderthal by today's standards, nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as stanwyck's (much younger, one presumes) brother, and marilyn monroe, as his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. on monterey's windswept coast (and all that monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the town looked like), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. a final point, and a spoiler: perhaps the breen office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey, but i give the marriage a month.

so many people have taken shots at platoon and born on the fourth of july among other calling them "leftist propaganda film." now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. to me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.the acting and writing was a little to clichéd for my liking. mel gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner randall wallace for yet another one. throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical "just tell my family i love them" or "tell ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed" lines. the was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that i felt like i had to vomit. how about that scene were gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this "no colors" applies to what to put in the washing machine. its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. another scene is were gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.the directing displayed this all perfectly. the countless scenes of gibson and his family or soldiers praying. i'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while i wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. how many scenes with the american flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. the director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in vietnam. what exactly was won their. the cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the american flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. i love america but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.this may seem like a rant and maybe it is but i cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. this movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. to me it says if your not christian your wrong. would god or jesus want people to kill i don't think so. to me this movie was offensive. at first this movie was funny with the countless clichés and overacted scenes but then when i looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. i guess though it is my fault that i chose to watch this movie. i hope no one takes this comment offensively because i am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.if you want a real depiction of the vietnam war watch platoon, born on the fourth of july, apocalypse now, the deer hunter or the killing fields. even full metal jacket which i absolutely hated was a better depiction. i have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong. a real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.

does anyone remember braveheart ? it starred mel gibson who also directed and was scripted by randall wallace . the film contains over 200 errors . does anyone remember the green berets ? that`s the john wayne western where the duke saves a homestead called vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . if you watch we were soldiers you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .first of all what`s with that scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? i mean what`s the connection between scotland and `nam ? maybe wallace is using it in the vain hope that because braveheart was bombarded - undeservedly i might add - with several oscars then so might this film ? whatever reason it`s included it really jars . gibson plays hal moore as a cross between william wallace and john wayne and i was expecting him to say something like " they`ll never take our freedom - the hell they will " and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with the green berets like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the wayne moviewhen not reminding the audience of other movies wws also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in america not asia . hal moore might have brushed up on the french experience in indo-china but if that`s the case then he was unique because the american military went out of their way not to read up on the french indo-china war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict westmoreland replied he had nothing to learn from the french " who haven`t won a war since the days of napoleon " so i was confused as to the portrayal of the nva in this movie , when in 1965 the american high command , brimming with hubris held the north vietnamese and vc in contempt . it`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of vietnam are superlative warriors . they are , but very few americans believed this in the mid 1960sthere`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? no bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the la drang valley . likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the americans out number the nva ? i put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . take the scene where the american burned to a crisp is flown away screaming " tell my wife i love her " . this should have an emotional impact similar to that death scene in platoon but here there`s no impact . in fact i found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words " tell my wife ... " while mutilated or dying , i counted at least two other characters use the phrase . did characters actually say this at the battle ? i`ve no idea but since randall wallace wrote the script i do have reservationsi sat in shocked awe watching apocalypse now , platoon and the killing fields made my eyes water , i laughed at full metal jacket , i kept looking at my watch with the deer hunter , and after seeing we were soldiers i felt totally patronised

coltrane and idle are members of a bank robbery gang who double cross their leader during a robbery. they hide out in a nunnery school and disguise themselves appropriately to avoid detection from the mob and the police. alot of catholic humor and slapstick but the script is kinda thin as are the laughs.. there is a good shower scene though... on a scale of one to ten..4

this film has been compared to the hilarious british comedy "a fish called wanda", although i can't see why. the only connection i can find is the monty python one (eric idle in "nuns", john cleese and michael palin in "wanda"). otherwise the two are incomparable.idle and robbie coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead, so they decide to rip off their boss and make for rio. when the getaway goes wrong, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns.what at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable, average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humour. once again there are the occasional high spots, but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings. an attempt at a "wanda" type manic finish fails too, along with the effort at "men in drag" humour, which is hardly surprising. when you think about it, men trying to be women is funny, men trying to be nuns is ridiculous.friday, april 22, 1994 - video

eric idle, robbie coltraine, janet suzman - it should have been almost impossible to go wrong. of course it has some funny moments - the scene in the showers when robbie coltraine echoes lon chaney jr's ghastly werewolf line "i can't help myself" is hilarious. but ultimately the plot, script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 "hail mary"s. when i was a child, carry on films filled this niche slightly better, which is a really sad indictment of a film with such a promising cast.

kk should stick to singing- this whole movie was a big bore. i can't understand the viciousness of the boys and the romance between miles and kk- the sex scenes were uninspired too. the ending was awful- unresolved- there needs to be reason to murder. and the whole voyeurism of the boy was weird..... the mother always wrestled with the boy- don't you think he would get some rather freudian with her? and why didn't someone teach kk how to speak with inflection instead of monotone?glad i only paid $1.00 to rent this. 

the movie is an adaptation of a japanese story by the respected author yukio mishima. it simply doesn't make the transition into a credible story about brits and americans.the story moves sluggishly, especially the part where miles and kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship's prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. the film moves so languidly that i even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate or erotic. the film did achieve a measure of notoriety when kristofferson's then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with miss miles during the filming. i guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn't quite the same for a viewer.there are no characters to hang on to. the sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable. kristofferson is amiable enough, but he just doesn't have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although perhaps we don't really want get too involved with him, considering his ultimate fate.as for the little kid, well, he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum's life. now this is a really bad crowd. they don't just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. they slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. this is shown in gory detail. but of course, this is only practice so they can do the same thing to kristofferson!so the movie mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid.the ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll ever see.this all might have made some sense if the japanese locale and cultural context had been retained. as it stands, it is just abysmal.

distasteful british film from a japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a hitler-like classmate and plots to harm his widowed mother's lover. a couple of good scenes (sarah miles discovering her son has been peeping at her and confronts him in anger, the pasty-faced lad trying to ensnare kris kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly), but what's the point beyond provoking shock? ugly and uneasy, it doesn't showcase anyone involved to any advantage (especially kristofferson, whose hollow stares and usual gravelly talk is out-of-place in a psychological mishmash like this one). coldly without any sense of its own absurdity, director lewis john carlino seems to believe a circumstance like this could actually happen. if he's right, that's far more shocking than anything in "sailor". * from ****

1st watched 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10(dir-henri verneuil): sober drama about a well-to-do doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman, whom his family brings in to live with them, as well as being married to another in the same household. his searching for happiness is not clear, but they do bring out the reason for his unhappiness rather well by displaying the overbearing trait of the females in his wife's line. well played, but predictable drama.

like i'm sure other people have said this guy isn't a very worthwhile subject. sure, our society has a morbid fascination with death, and it's funny hearing him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he's into giving himself an unworthy mystique. anyway, the bottom line is that he's a moron racist using feeble methods to try to disprove the mountain of evidence of the holocaust, and as such he should be forgotten by time. but morris is in love with any kind of curiosities, which normally i wouldn't fault him for.

i hired this movie out from my local movie shop, not really expecting anything to flash or fancy. since it was a "b" grade movie, made on a very tight budget. the opening scenes of the film were rather original and so was the plot and thats what made me hire the movie out. however the film becomes very boring and frustrating at points. the story had plenty of holes in it and the acting had its fair share of disappointments as well by the end of the film i was praying that a higher power was going to strike me down where i laid as i was extremely bored but more importantly frustrated with how the story turned out. i still don't understand what actually happened and i don't particularly care. in conclusion the devil would cry in disgust to know that hell (his domain ) was used as a basis for such a crappy film.

this remake is entitled "that darn cat", but d.c. the cat is more of a sideline than the major character. patti randall was not likable at all in this remake either. she reminded me of one of those high school goth jerks you read about who have been angry since the day they were born, so they end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day. the federal cop, kelso was okay, but not as good as the one in the original. i guess disney was trying to make christina ricci and doug doug (or whatever goofy name he has) into stars, but they don't hold a candle to hayley mills and dean jones in the original. i'm an animal lover and a cat lover and i don't blame d.c. for the remake being so much more inferior to the original movie. after all, they nearly cut him out of the whole movie. all in all, a very poor remake.

but i still enjoyed watching her, so i gave it a 3 instead of a 1. her expressions are priceless. some of the other cast members (e.g., michael mckean) are really slumming, too. the cat himself is somewhat amusing. aside from that, the movie is all cliche, culminating in a much-too-long car chase. (it's also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude, having been very "family" until then.)

the disney studios' remake of their own 1965 slapstick classic concerns a clever feline leading an f.b.i. agent to a kidnapped woman. christina ricci gives a churlish, let-me-outta-here performance as the cat's owner and the fed is played by doug e. doug, embarrassingly over-the-top, like a human cartoon. a pair of rich neurotics (dyan cannon and original "cat" cast member dean jones) are funny and the formula-plot still has a little juice left in it, but the handling here is so heavy and lugubrious, and the cat is so lifeless, that it's strictly d.o.a. * from ****

chris ricci sleepwalks her way through most of this, but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain - much as i did when watching it. without her this would be no more than a cheap kids' movie, but at least she does add an air of quality. there are few, if any, more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business.there's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap disney re-make aimed at very undemanding children. i could watch ricci all day so i'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings, but unless you too are a ricci fan, a cat-lover, or very small child, i doubt you will find this very entertaining.

i was 12 years old when i saw the original film (i lived in italy and the italian title was "fbi, operation cat!") that was a fun film and not just for kids. this awful remake it's pathetic even for a 5 year old! what possessed disney to ruin their reputation and the memory of a lovely film i don't know and i just can't believe it. even the title song in the original film (both original version and the dubbed italian version) was extremely nice and creating the mood for the story. on this remake the title song is even worst than the movie itself. it was just nice to see dean jones even if for just a cameo appearance, he was a regular on the great old disney's films. i cannot honestly see anything else positive in this remade movie.

i guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience. you can either say to yourself a) "let's make a movie that kids today will love!" or b) "let's make a movie that i would have loved when i was a kid!" the second approach explains why steven spielberg often make movies that appeal to a younger audience. prime examples are e.t., the goonies or indiana jones. that darn cat is an example of the first approach. you see these flat, unbelievable characters saying things that is supposed to be funny but isn't. the plot itself is enough for a ten minute short, but instead it goes on and on. and although i'm not a kid, i don't quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids? the clumsy cops chased by a dog, the old lady with a tweety bird or christina ricci's sarcastic oneliners? one actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humour: doug e. doug playing the fbi agent.

the weakest of the 'old' crew star trek films, this film suffers from an awful script and obvious budget constraints, particularly in the mishandled finale. the bones of a good movie are here, and the directing from shatner is not as bad as is commonly made out, but the characters end up speaking and acting way out of the style that the previous 3 films had carefully established. lawrence luckinbull is convincing as the renegade vulcan with msyterious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, particularly for deforest kelley who shines as 'bones' mccoy in this his second last movie. however, as good as those scenes are, they ultimately do not advance the plot, and end up feeling as more of a distraction. a great score from the ever reliable goldsmith and some funny scenes in yosemite between the main three are not enough to cover the gaping chasms in the plot, and the frankly embarassing attempts at humour serve only to alienate even die hard trekkies. all in all, a wealth of possibilities which although it fails to deliver, has its moments. watch out for the pool table in the bar brawl scene...

that's the only word i can think of to describe this movie. not waste as in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in a waste of opportunities.when i see this movie, i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose. the setup was like an average television episode, while the finish felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie.nimoy, in directing ii-iv, focused on the character of spock--how he faced the kobayashi maru outside of the classroom, and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh. shatner could have done the same with kirk here, but he didn't. we don't know much about kirk that we didn't know before. again, one of the novels would have been better--try "my enemy, my ally" for a very interesting character study of our friend james t. the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits, and the scotty-uhura subplot seems way out of left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was sulu-uhura.even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here. sorry, but it's true.

much like final fantasy, if you look at a still shot - it doesn't look so bad. but when the people start moving, it's utterly horrifying. uneven jerky motions, frightening lack of emotion, and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps. the characters do not even appear alive/organic.i saw a preview screening with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! she was not at all engaged. for the record, i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixar-esque films as well as a number of the 'bad' 2d films like sinbad.the lighting is painful, giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. the lip syncing is bad - worse actually than final fantasy. i also seriously question having hanks play five characters.... this was a major distraction throughout the film. the role of the conductor is eerie - although in a way i just can't pinpoint. it reminds me of my father's fake "phone" voice when greeting clients.i think this is why the multiple roles are distracting - you are accutely aware that the voice is the same, but yet distinctly different. it gives each character the feel of being acted, as opposed to being real human characters. the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks. i've seen the technique work - a la eddie murphy, but hanks just can't come close to pulling it off with a voice alone, given the horrifying animation.i would not waste my money on this - wait for the rental.

the polar express. director robert zemeckis, i love back to the future, forrest gump, contact, and who framed roger rabbit (no question mark after that movie title!!). and tom hanks, one of my favorite actors. the reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic. ebert & roeper give it two enthusiastic thumbs up! even ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! wow... ok... this i gotta see! but wait... the motion capture used looks really weird. hmm... maybe i'm not so interested in seeing this anymore."well, you comin?" says the train conductor to the boy in the polar express. the boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins on its course without him. the boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time. now, most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the tv train or rental express (hee hee, i'm so witty and clever). i, on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first, but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about. i just wasted $10 and two hours of my life. i can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. the polar express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny. there's no story. there's no pay off. you sit there through these series of events and you wonder "is there any point to all this?" it'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining... but they're not.this movie is void of any emotion, any soul, any ounce of plausibility, and most of all: any fun. this movie is not fun. and let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. saying that it's the same technology (motion, i'm sorry, "performance" capture) used to make gollum is a real shame because gollum was believable!!! photo-realism just does not translate well in this medium. you're using animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? or why not just film it all with real actors? they certainly could have. we as people know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive. caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable, as the incredibles has proved. the result of the polar express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets. they're moving and talking, but where's the heart? where's the soul? that's what we're seeing on the screen. ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh! this movie is so horrible! there's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it. he wants to give it to her but you sit there going "why??!" just leave it.. she's coming back! he of course loses the ticket and "adventure" ensues. and then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can't come up and join the rest of the kids? and then there's this annoying "know it all" kid with the voice of a 35 year old. it's all so very disturbing. oh and there's songs! one girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is. he's singing a song to himself. and then she interrupts and joins in! they end the song as they're holding hands, looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers. very awkward. i won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train. "keep it hot keep it hot!" the one scene where tom hanks slides on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably bad scenes in the history of bad scenes. i have to stop now or i'll just kill myself. i need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette. yes... crappy is better than the polar express. "the one thing about trains, it doesn't matter where you're going, what matters is deciding to get on."don't get on this one. for the love of god, i have decided for you! this is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form. it happened with the grinch and the cat in the hat and those were horrible also. but who can blame them? i bet if i took the book, the berenstein bears' too much junk food, and turned that into a feature film, it'd probably be pretty dull also. but at least... there'd be a story and a point, which is what the polar express is so lacking of.

this movie is awful. it creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. including an obnoxious little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. not to mention the yiddish speaking elves. the book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.the animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by hollywood.the good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.

"the polar express " was an awful movie .what makes this movie worst is the hypocrisy to present itself as a innocent ,sugary and harmless tale for children about the "true " meaning of christmas . i never read the book of chris van allsburg in what it was inspired ,but the most disappointing is that it was directed by robert zemeckis ,the same who made the great "who framed roger rabbit?",a excellent movie where he proof that the animation could be appreciated for kids and adults equally ,while in this movie it seems that he was victim of his own ambition and he give too much importance to create impressive level of detail than a interesting story .i'm sorry to say this ,but "the polar express " have so much artistic level as a publicity campaign of a video -game or toy . everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless : the characters could look like humans ,but they don't have nothing of life on them ,and they have a malevolent touch in their eyes .but the worst ...is the "message" in this movie .you could see it at some parts of the movie ,and believe me ,it was vile .take for example one scene ,where one kid refuses to enter to the polar express . notice that the character that looks like tom hanks makes a gesture like saying "you are stupid to don't accept my offering " .second ,when the girl says that the toys are so "warm " and things like that . all the damn movie the kids keep talking about how big would be the gifts that santa would give to them . there is even a song about the gifts !the vagabond is a irrelevant and weak character . and ,in the last scene the character seems to "discover " the true meaning of christmas : and what would be ? what do you think ? the gifts ! many christmas movies are close to say something like it ,but "the polar express " it's a ode to the materialism and greed . seriouslly ,i refuse to call it a "children's movie " , because if is that what the kids would learn ,i don't want to think how would be our future .

i borrowed this on dvd from a friend the other day. i didn't really know what to expect. i haven't seen a lot of russian movies, and i don't think i've ever seen a russian war movie. maybe that made me expect something different, something more along the line of an imagined russian mentality. but whatever those expectations came from, they were put to shame as this is a quite ordinary war movie.the whole formula of following a few young people from their recruitment, through training, to deployment and through some battles, is well known. we have seen it done both many years ago, as well as more recently (as with jarhead). sure, there's a difference here because the movie is about russian soldiers instead of americans as is almost always the case. but in general this could just as easily have been a vietnam-movie. i guess that just underscores my feeling that afghanistan was the soviet unions vietnam. a country that should have been a pushover for a superpower made the war drag on for years with terrible loss of life both for soldiers and civilians.the good points in this movie i felt were good photography (there are some beautiful ambiance shots) and decent effects for what i guess must have been a rather low budget movie. what made me disappointed is mostly the story itself. it just doesn't manage to stir any emotion in me. mostly because the character development is lousy. and to really feel something when people are gunned down you have to make them people, not just faceless cardboard cutouts. they fail to do that in this movie. also it's overly long, and that seems to a kind of trend lately. in my opinion a movie that's more than two hours long has to have a lot to offer, and this movie doesn't cut it. also there is a disturbing music that's put like a wet blanket over every scene. especially in the action scenes this is highly disturbing, not that you need action-music but something more than just slow keyboard-music would be nice. otherwise the production values were good enough, that was not where the problem was.i don't know how to view this movie. as a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are, war sucks? that russian film-makers have already watched too many american war-movies to make something original? regardless of which, this movie is rather clichéd, lacks in spirit and while it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks in script and character development. in the end it just becomes another of all those war-movies that fails to make you think, and fails to add something to the genre. i've seen a lot worse, but a lot better too. i rate this 4/10.

i can't believe this movie has an average rating of 7.0! it is a fiendishly bad movie, and i saw it when it was fairly new, and i was in the age group that is supposed to like it!

to this day, i have never seen elizabeth shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. poorly acted, poorly plotted and racially neanderthal, it took place in a chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . spoiler ahead. . . . . ..spoiler: her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it - 'nobody leaves without singing the blues' -- was as dumb as a post. the children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end i was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them.i have to say though, there is one special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what chopper, the phantom menace and catwoman could not -- make me sick to my stomach.

i would not recommend this movie. even though it is rated g and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing (including the dreaded 'f' and 's' words). this kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film? come on.there was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! the acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid'.despite having elizabeth shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned blackwell hotel to clean it out as community service. they soon discover that it's the residence of a hulking psychopath (kane) who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs. it doesn't help that the guard watching over them (steven vidler) has had a previous run-in with the beast four years earlier. a guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films. most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value. see no evil is a good example of this. it features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining. the premise sounds like a mixture between friday the 13th, saw 2 and halloween: resurrection. i really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well. it was really just a bunch of clichés and everything was predictable. screenwriter dan madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently. the death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome. director gregory dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills. the acting is pretty bland and unremarkable. this is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them. it was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable. kane is surprisingly mediocre. i was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job. a second rate jason voorhees, if you will. the rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers. while the death scenes are gory, they aren't necessary scary. there's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. because of this, the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value. also, if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one. it will do little to change your opinion. in the end, see no evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching. rating 6/10

all right, let's be realistic about this. nobody goes into a movie produced by wwe films (whose owner has challenged god to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the between the cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named kane, and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter. if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? well, here's what i was looking forward to:1) bad acting. 2) a fairly non-existent, clichéd storyline. 3) kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) tons and tons of gore. well, if you're hungry for some "so bad it's funny" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. i think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? i personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator?i know, i know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. uh-huh.i think you pretty much know what to expect, but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. first, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. shouts of "kill him, kane!" and "i hope you die first!" and "chokeslam!" echoed through the theater, showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer. i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. however, i can see how others could be annoyed by it.second, and this shouldn't even warrant explanation, the film doesn't shy away from the gore. if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream "fun night at the movies!" for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part. i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like "say goodnight" (his character's last name is "goodnight") right before he killed a victim. instead he uttered four words in the entire film - "nooooooo!" and "i see it." but hey, he delivered them flawlessly!if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like "place your betts!" or "all betts are off!" it'd rule and you know it. we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. feel free to send me your suggestions. for now we'll just call 'em hor-larious!

ho humm - - - more of nothing. if you are a long-time rush fan you know what this video contains: loathsome songs from the past, the "big 3" hits from the 80's and their "last-ditch" efforts to remain contemporary. they do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as "dinosaurs." unfortunately, they fail at protecting themselves from embarrassment. close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys have been.if you are have been following (as much as you can stomach) the band for a couple of decades from the 70's, then you know there is no new material here. same old, same old: 1) neil avoids the press, 2) no real behind-the-scenes (geddy looses his shoes?! give me a break! even he thinks it's absurd!) 3) no new insights.a better video would have been to show the crew setting up for 3 or 4 hours  just let the camera run. and stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! i understand the director wants to try to do something artsy. but then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the viewer can choose. we know what the band looks like  let us see what we really want to see.do yourself a big favor: rent this movie first.

in comparison to other "sand and sandal" fare, the egyptian leaves much to be desired. the film is very loosely based upon mika waltari's well researched novel, which centers around the egyptian physician sinhue's adventures at the court of akhnaton as well as his travels throughout canaan, minoan crete and africa. unfortunately, due to the moral strictures of the time, much of sinhue's story (which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the cutting room floor and instead, the audience is treated to reels and reels of victor mature's wooden acting. even gene tierney  a leading lady "staple" of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time. there is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs. polytheism, but michael wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary akhnaton, that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel. my advice: buy the book from e-bay, rent something more entertaining like solomon and sheba and then call it a night!

i am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. having read the book several times (and all the other historical novels by mika waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. if i forget the origins of the story i might consider it a reasonably good epic. of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class. i can't understand why even the name of nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just nefer. i love peter ustinov as kaptah and marlon brando probably would have made a better sinuhe but the overall attitude is too hollywood to ever make justice to the book. mind you mika waltari left the premier of this film in the middle of the showing. that's how much he liked it.

the cinemascope color cinematography of leon shamroy is quite remarkable here,including his use of colored filters forvarious scenes. the alfred newmann score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced. it's a shame it is no longer available on cd. the actors, however, never rise to the occasion. the accents are so varied, from the subdued british of ustinov and purdom to the hollywood of baxter and mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision. tommy rettig is jarringly american. acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted. only ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal. the premise - the story of a young egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god, ra - persecuted by the authorities, has its interesting points. but when the film's plot fades, it is the haunting music and visuals that remain.

i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. i would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice. you are just a big fony hypocrite.

tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. the same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. people come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. my daughter has a 36" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, i am more average at a size 12. we would like to see both- i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it, it will not fit the same way on me. i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. thank you.

in watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: one - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a "model" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition. no other "famous" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so. but as the series goes on and on i've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. women shouldn't watch this, teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject.many women try out for slots to compete for "americas next top model". they live together, cat fight together, cry together, get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim, "you will see me again". heck, i'm trying to see what happened to the ones that did win, actually.this is the dream of some girls, and good for them. in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way - like to college.i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the "ploy" of full figured models joining the group. that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. the "full figured models" were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a "ploy" fashionatas use all the time. bad, bad, tyra and crew.but to be fair, "americas next top model" is not about "full figured" models, it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. hence the name of the show. hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. hence tyra and her consistent "this was me" plugs every camera angle you can get. but then again, that is the one thing i like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. but after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.

tyra banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. the inside counts for something too. a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. i see tyra less involved with the girls in every season. about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr. jay manuel. recently, tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. i felt that she should have done more to encourage her. it was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident trannie ms. jay to help the girl out. instead, the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. it's a shame because i truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons. there's a reason why project runway has all 4 seasons out on dvd and top model only has 1 season on dvd. it's called taste. top model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity.

this is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers "san pedro beach bums".my wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a "walk". the end result was straight out of monty python's "ministry of silly walks" sketch. i couldn't laugh hard enough.and then there's the ubiquitous ms. banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). she has to be the most annoying self-important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left "the view". as if modeling was doing great things for mankind. please. i've never found her attractive, and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.

i was wondering what possessed the organizers of the victoria film festival to include this film in their program. i guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film. i, on the other hand, consider it the worst film i have ever seen. it starts with a bad script, full of holes, and dialog so unlikely it's embarrassing. ideas are introduced, then dropped with no development. the acting left me totally cold and uninvolved. the set decoration was appropriate for the time, but a decorator's nightmare. the only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly. the attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years. the photography was leaden and lacking in variety. save your money for something worthwhile.

tamara anderson and her family are moving once again, as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape. fifteen years old, she is in her rebellious stage. already angry at her father for their frequent relocations, her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis. her mother's absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion, the boy next door, rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house.the story is modest to a fault. it's oddly paced, and even during its emotional scenes there isn't any tension. the actors portraying the parents are fine. alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and maria ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager. but katie boland, as tamara, is too amateurish to carry the movie. the dialog is very natural and boland can't quite pull it off. she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward. one can see her thinking 'ok this is what my line is and this is the face i'm supposed to make' rather than actually reacting to the other actors. she's not the only one, kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they're in fewer scenes.if done right, the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie. and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing.

the director seems like a good, solid man. his parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with. they strayed from each other. they loved each other. they misunderstood each other. and the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of long island.there are few interesting choices in this documentary--the music is banal, the filming uninspired, and the story is the same story that has played out on every birch street in every town in america. i don't mean to sound too harsh--seldom has a sweeter, more well-intentioned documentary been made. the director is the kind of man with whom you'd want to be friends. you just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive.

this documentary is rife with problems.how arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? i understand you think the subject is interesting. i was bored with it. this isn't a fascinating story to me, and i don't know why you would think it was.i don't want to come off as mean, but i have to say: most of the people in this film are just not attractive. and that's ok, not everyone is pretty. but your camera technique, to stick the lens in their face so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47" tv, is not enjoyable. i had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts, wrinkles, bags under eyes and yellow teeth. really, i'm trying not to sound inhuman, but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face.the camera work in this "film" is rank amateur level. it's the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic. uninteresting framing, unsteady, even static shots are done carelessly. put a little effort into it, if you're going to do this for a living.i honestly can't see what the big deal is about this thing.

after seeing the movie, i feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person, although not perfect at all. on the contrary, i don't like the author, and his two sisters.is a person's journal an accurate portrait of herself? no. most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. so a journal is always a more negative side of a person. in this movie, the author judge his mother's life by her journal. not a wise choice.the author's elder sister is so ugly, external and internal. first, she said her father's second marriage is "not fair" for her mother. then, she said she doesn't love her mother. so, she don't love both father and mother. i doubt she love anybody in the world. her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. through out the movie, i feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. however, i feel the father are mother are very loving to their children, even the author try to portrait them as cold, deceitful person.

this may well be the worst remake hollywood has ever produced, and that's saying something. i'll take it further than that and say this movie is so stunningly, deliriously bad that it must be seen. i don't know if i'm even capable of tackling all the things wrong with it--like the fact that the casting director appears to have pulled names out of a hat, or the mind-blower of richard gere's character being allowed to walk away scot-free at the end (i'm sure the people saying, "it's just fiction, who cares" would have no problem if it was a former al-qaeda operative who just wants to return to his home country)--so i'll just devote my review to the utter hilarity, which is mainly the scene where bruce willis is testing out his gun. in the original version, you'll recall, the jackal practices his kill on a pumpkin. the pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "understatement." in this version, willis sets up a pumpkin target, but he doesn't use a sniper rifle--he uses a gigantic remote-controlled cannon which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge conspicuous minivan (this man likes a challenge). he reveals the cannon by pulling away a tarp, at which point jack black, who is there to observe, jumps around and says, "that rocks! this thing rocks!" about 18 times (i guess willis didn't have to disassemble it first, he just lifted it, tarp and all, out of the back of the van, despite it probably weighing several tons). the scene then turns into an austin powers movie as willis misses the pumpkin and takes out a tree, then has black run through the mud with his pants falling down, finally blowing off black's entire arm. the pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. if i can recommend this movie for one non-ironic reason, it's for the diane venora character as a tough russian major who becomes romantically linked to gere despite having a facial disfigurement--a bold move for a hollywood feature. by mid- movie i was really liking this character, so it was a shame when she had to be killed. i would have liked to see a movie about her. other than that, this pile of crap is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 3/10.

spoilers!! bruce willis, the part-time comic and funny guy plays a hispanic assassin nicknamed after an african scavenger prairie dog? i guess all the good hispanic nicknames like sicatriz (scar), scorpion, viper, cobra, snake, tarantula, latigo (whip), navaja (blade), etc. were not available?? and why would some south american assassin be acquainted with a terrorist from the irish republican army?? last time i checked, the ira is not looking to open any branch headquarters in south america. and why would some prison-tough, battle-weary irish terrorist look like a middle-aged richard gere? i thought maybe this movie was going to be a spoof of "the crying game" when gere's character was introduced as the person who was going to hunt down "the jackal." what bad casting! and why would the fbi be hiring depraved terrorists in order to track down assassins?? it seems like a terrorist goes for mass destruction, and an assassin usually hits one target in a non-spectacular manner. but gere is the only person who has ever seen willis alive, according to the fbi. i thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very great film "day of the jackal" but this movie is just a dumber version of "assassins" with stallone and banderas. both of these movies are really dumb, and part of the dumb-ness is the fact that as the audience we are forced to watch bruce willis go through his routines and we should say "wow! isn't he smart!" the professional with jean reno was a much better movie about assassins. "the jackal" is just a movie about two fat middle-aged millionaire actors who could get paid for standing around looking pretty and pretending to be smart! "the jackal" is so poor, that i expected to see sly stallone, dennis rodman, mickey rourke, and jean clod van dumme making cameo appearances as "other" hitmen or fbi. needless to say, "the jackal" has eluded the fbi for twenty-five years, but as soon as richard gere gets on the job, it is only a few days before "the jackal" is kaput! i guess the positive message of this movie is, "thanks to terrorists, our streets are safe from assassins." overall, the "jackal" has no redeeming qualities.

laughably awful. one might think that all the big-name actors involved in this movie would at least make it believable, but they do not--this one is a stinker.characters either sprint around without having a good reason to know where they are going, or they stand around making constipated faces when they should be running for their lives.check your higher brain functions at the door if you intend to try watching this movie. or, get a bunch of your most clever friends together and give this one the "mystery science theater 3000" treatment. that's what i was doing through the second half of this turkey.and please don't confuse this with the excellent movie "the day of the jackal," a far-superior thriller from 30 years ago.

amidst all the many problems that make this a dire piece of celluloid is the stupidest plot device in recent cinema history. richard gere determines who the jackal's real target is through some form of revelation. he does not work anything out, it just comes to him. when in doubt "he's going after the first lady!". this film blows chunks.

roll up! roll up! it's big gay bruce and his big gay death cannon! plausible plot? unnecessary! decent acting? unnecessary! respect shown to its mighty progenitor? unnecessary! yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the butch bruce canon.i mean where do you start with this film? okay, let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was, in some way, related to either the book or the original film, the day of the jackal. it's not. in fact it's so different (and so bad) that fredrick forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. now i'm not necessarily a stuffy brit who can't hack hollywood remaking british films. well, okay, maybe i am a bit like that, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. this film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive.now let's move to the premise. cheesy russian gangster gets killed in a moscow police raid (somehow involving the fbi although no one bothers to explain why). in revenge, brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the us president (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move  although to be fair it was pre-9-11, so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the us airforce carpet bombing eastern europe). gangster hires "nasty" killer (willis). police hire "cuddly" killer (gere), "cuddly" killer tracks "nasty" killer. police fanny around and periodically get killed. "cuddly" killer kills "nasty" killer. first lady is saved and we all realise that the ira are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know, who just happen to want to kill innocent people. nice.let's put to one side the distasteful hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of northern ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park (i deal with this point more extensively on the message boards). if hollywood directors want to cast the belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold, that's up to them. i, of course, reserve the right to despise them for it. it's a free country.more egregious, however, is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the irish while trying to support them. that's not politically distasteful, it's far worse: it's incompetent. it's no wonder, for instance, that gere still looks so damn good, given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra*p. the fact that gere's accent is not only southern irish, but an appalling parody of southern irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond america to make money from this film. then there is that lovely scene at the end where sidney poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says he's off for a coffee, offers to get our "cuddly" ira man one, then casually says "ah, but then you guys drink guinness don't you". yeah that's right sidney; the irish live on guinness and potatoes.while we're on the subject of poitier: why? in the original film the detective is the tracker. in jackal, gere is the tracker. so what does poitier do? well, he just hangs around and looks like a tw*at of course. he's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end, and he only does this because the nice ira man tells him to.while we're on the subject of gere: why? i suppose it's only a matter of time before hollywood remakes gandhi with vin diesel playing ex-mujahideen commando mahatma gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s india (he is, after all, a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a muslim fundamentalist). let's not forget that gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. and if he's not, why does he know the jackal? if he's not, why does he know all his moves? and if he is, why is he such a limp biscuit and such a "loveable" person? all this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character(c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend  i honestly thought this had turned into a bond movie (d) give the "central" characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence.this film is an insult to the british and irish killed at the hands of terrorists, it's an insult to the irish people, it's an insult to not great, but pretty good film it rips off, and an insult to the intelligence. but most of all  and most unforgivable  it is an insult to my a*rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. honestly, you'd think with no plot, no characters and no dialogue, it would be over in no time. but they didn't even have the decency to quit early.

heaven, mary and all the saints above! a young man has got super sperm, it's miracle bejesus, call the pope, all you ladies out their desperate to get preggers, line up out side his door and drop your marks and sparks finest! risible retro ealing comedy type comedy, trying to bring you a bit of the auld irish charm. has an effect like placing two fingers down your own throat, voamitus maximus! one out of ten!

the most fertile man in ireland revolves around eamon manley who is 24 year old and still happens to be a virgin. he lives with his mother in belfast. he is also a very shy guy towards women. everything has changes for eamon when he is seduced by a woman(as far as i can remember a neighbour). it is not because he looses his virginity but he discovers that he has a super power. despite having protection, this neighbour becomes pregnant. he is told by the doctor that he has very high sperm count. his mother brilliantly comes up with an idea which makes us see ginger headed babies all around in the end of the film. he starts helping out women in both side of belfast to conceive babies. first voluntarily then with the help of his colleague runs a business out of it. the most fertile man in ireland has its funny moments but needed to come up with better jokes and with a better script. i couldn't help thinking that it gave me the impression of a tv sitcom rather than a movie. kris marshall is a different name on the silver screen but does not shine as star. it's more like the guy you saw in such and such movie. like him being in love actually(i think he was very funny in that one)..well, it was okay to watch but couldn't help dozing off from time to time. ** out of *****

a movie theater with a bad history of past gruesome murders reopens. of course, the bloody killings start anew. written, directed, shot, scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless rick sloane (who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious "hobgoblins"), this horrendously ham-fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way: the excruciatingly lethargic pacing, the painfully static, grainy cinematography (there's a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout), an annoyingly droning and redundant hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, the flat (non)direction, a tediously talky and uneventful script, the groan-inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, the bloodless murder set pieces, a pitifully unscary killer (he's just some wrinkled-up old guy in pasty make-up), the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters, a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending, and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar. this crud totally lacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy vigor required to be enjoyable junk. instead it's just a bland, plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a so-shoddy-it's-smoking sort of way. only a smidgen of nudity and the delightful presence of the always dependable mary woronov as a snarky, sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall crumminess of this lousy loser.

this movie was so dumb and slow was it ever slow. the only good part of the film was the girl in the tight shinny gold pants. there was no gore whatsover and what is a 80's horror movie without a little gore. plus the killer wasn't at all scary nor were the murders. but if you like to watch the world's worst horror movie then this is for you. don't waste your time like i did watching this.

the most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade-z "film". mary woronov, a clever actress best known for her roles as mary bland in eating raoul and miss togar in rock 'n' roll high school, is by far the best thing about this tripe. this film is almost too bad even for mst3k - honestly!

i agree that mary woronov (murdoch's secretary) is one of the only good things about this film. she is my favorite actress ever, every role she plays is always done so well. her character is sly, sarcastic, clever, light hearted, funny and cunning. she really pulls this role off well and you get a good feel for what her character is all about. the rest of the movie is pretty bad. the music is the most entertaining thing left. one of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight zebra striped tank top.one thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea that someone hires these three college-aged kids to spruce up an old abandoned theater. he gives them the keys and says - go at it. that would be really fun and i wish someone would give me that chance! imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you get to decide how to decorate it, and fix it up. you have total control over the whole building. that would be so fun! unfortunately, the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure, they think of it as a big chore. they walk around with long faces and fight with each other the whole time. it's kind of a bummer. but it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people aren't even excited about.the movie does a pretty good job at making you feel helpless or a little spooked out by the theater itself. however, the acting (besides woronov.. and possibly murdoch, the boss - just because makes a really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has any luck) is really horrible and you just end up feeling unsatisfied. plus, the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruins the reality that the film tries to create.watch this if you dig mary woronov, funky 80's casio keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is at all intriguing.

three young movie theater employees are given the task of re-opening a long closed old-time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place. it seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own. as they approach the grand re-opening night, things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises.oh, this is truly horrible. in fact, if it wasn't for mary woronov's secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy selina, this would be a total loss. the only other good thing i have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive, albeit not overly gory (a preference for me but not necessarily for others), fashion. the rest just wallows in constant sleaze (so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it) and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine.

to truly appreciate this film you had to be there (acting?) or have been a crew member.yes, i am "selena", and at the ripe old age of 42, have serious doubts about what we were doing/did.it all started out to be like a "john waters" type thing, friends acting badly in bad films. somewhere along the line,the fun discontinued, people who were supposed to be friends didn't speak anymore, and bad became worse.i regret the bad image i might have projected.(try to fit in size one gold spandex pants,)other than that, the film sucks so badly, i would not even make my mama watch it.to my director, cast and crew i say,"why can't we just all get along??it's been over twenty years, people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

read the book, forget the movie!

voor een verloren soldaat , for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching, complex psychological study, of that most magical time in a man's life, when he is still a child, but starting to become a man. the novel records the real life experiences of rudy van dantzig, as told thru the boy jeroen, during the waning days of wwii at age 11 as he deals with his incipient sexuality, and his deep fears of abandonment as he has been sent to the province of friesland, north of holland by his parents because of the lack of food in amsterdam and has not heard from them in many months as the postal service has broken down.. the arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film, is presented in a painfully corny way, with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style. then one soldier, walt, romances jeroen and the pair is presented as two frolicking males.who consummate their love in a sexual experience. this taken in stride by the 11 yo jeroen. the reality was somewhat different: jeroen describes his encounters with walt, 6 in all, in detail but in oblique language. but there is no misunderstanding their nature. walt is aroused to an intense passion by jeroen, during which he handles him roughly, so that in their final meeting, jeroen is bruised and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where walt has bitten him. during this encounter, walt rapes jeroen, twice. jeroen could have easily avoided walt after their 2nd encounter, when walt first assaults him as walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers. why jeroen keeps seeking walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not explainable, by me anyway. what the film leaves out is the aftermath: the nightmares, the dejection, the frantic search throughout amsterdam on the chance of finding walt, for jeroen loved walt, and nothing could shake that.

this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and... i stopped caring. this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex. there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment. also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...sounds promising?not really.i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film. basically i started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up.it may work for you, it didn't for me.

i've had never been disappointed by a kurosawa film, but this is probably the first. "doppelganger" is the worst i've seen from this director.tartan films is advertising this as "the most frightening film yet from kiyoshi kurosawa". what? the most frightening film from kurosawa is definitely "kairo". and if you think this is horror, your in for a surprise. this can't be classified as horror, or thriller. this is a drama, and a pretty bad one at that. a lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny, and a lot of the plot is really confusing. and since it's kurosawa, the pacing is slow. but it's so slow that you'll lose interest forty minutes in, and feel like doing something else. the thing that annoyed me the most was the use of cgi. now cgi, if used well, can be really cool. but if executed with little care... it can be a disaster. i think that describes one scene here that has a very minimal use of cgi.the only positive thing i can give "dopppelganger" is that it has really good acting. koji yakusho gives a great performance, along with the rest of the cast. but that's pretty much it...please, do yourself a favor, and go watch "kairo" or "ko-rei" if you want to be scared. this is a bad, bad attempt at a smart drama. which it is intelligent, but... well, there's a lot missing.3/10 for the good acting.

would someone explain to me when the ghoulies learned to speak? this was a horrible film, i loved "ghoulies" and "ghoulies 2", but what's this? unless you want to kill yourself, please stay away from "ghoulies 3". on a scale of 1 to 10, "ghoulies 3" gets a 1!!

this rubber monsters failed trying to be cool,scary or even comedians,looks like a wannabe movie of porkys or animals house but the sequences and history is not always clear also can't catch your attention all the movie looks cheap and with an amazing bad taste,the only thing that's makes you laugh is the awful rubber monsters who must have a cost of one dollar each,because the work or them never looks realistic,the movements and expressions make looks the muppets as a pixar 3d movie when you compare with this. hope marie carlton is the only thing that makes supportable this awful movie,and when she dies in the movie,this turns even worst than before.a movie who only must be seen in fast forward.

lame is really the best way to describe this movie. it has a real poor script, uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well. there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them. what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character. instead now the movie has a bit of everything, it has a bit of an hero, it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain. i wish it only had a bit less ghoulies though, fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie.ghoulies are supposed to be devilish creatures, who murder for pleasure. in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. besides, someone had the 'brilliant' idea to let the ghoulies be able to talk this time. this works out really poorly and annoying. the ghoulie-puppets had been definitely upgraded for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more, however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous ghoulies movies.it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time. the movie is like a lame '80's high-school comedy (even though this movie got released in 1991). it's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the entire movie. it's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all.the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically one big mess, that never seems to end. the ghoulies plot line seems basically to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie, involving the human characters. the movie is not at all about the ghoulies terrorizing a college, with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage. no big surprise that this is brent olson's only written movie as of yet. he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself instead.even when compared to the previous ghoulies movies; this movie is just simply terrible!2/10

i don't really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation. unfortunatly it was misplaced. firstly this is not horror, it doesn't scare and (unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for - which is possible) doesn't try to. it's a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1. this film ripps of gremlins in a truly special way, i can't claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more. very, very bad - avoid.

maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end. that's odd, because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed midsummers night's dream once, many years ago, when i saw it on the stage. i think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name, calista flockhart, and michelle feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. well, i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands....

i have been watching "lost" with my family since the first episode, it used to be great. the last season it was very disappointing, it seems as if they (writers)don't know what to do with the show, so, they keep trying to make it up for it by stretching one story line in a whole episode. the present season, which by the way i decided to keep watching only to see rodrigo santoro, and also with a tiny little hope that things would get better; has been one disappointment after another; my husband and son even stopped watching. first of all, he (santoro) only appears for 30 seconds in each episode. but the real problem is with the story line, there is nothing really happening, each episode could be shown in 15 minutes. we watch each episode waiting for something that never happens; i am not asking that every secret be revealed at once, but how about some variation in the story lines? in the first and second seasons, we had different story lines, we saw the characters history, a little action, a little romance, now is like one big event that takes the whole episode to unveil. it is almost tiring to watch it, when it finishes you have a feeling that you lost your time. now, it is important to note that the actors still great.i can't believe they killed mr. eko(adelawale...)he was great, jack(mathew fox)is still incredible, the perfect hero, so kind, magnanimous, brave. sawyer(josh holloway), the "bad boy" is kind of mellowing because of kate(evangeline lylli), but that's cool. i miss sayid(naveen andrews), sun and jin(yoon-jin kim & daniel dae kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we barely see them. i hope paulo(rodrigo santoro) will have a big part on the show; if not, why did you make such a big deal of him joining the show (access hollywood, etc)? sorry if i've been rumbling for too long, but i feel cheated by this show. when i started watching it was great, i got used to it, and now it is very disappointing to see the way it is going. i'll be here, hoping for the improvements!!! katia

i've enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when lost is good, it's really good! but this episode that features mr echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that i found myself tapping the fast forward button. this episode stood out so far as by far the worst. in fact, the variation in quality of lost has been so inconsistent, i find myself often wondering how many writers they are using.i will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope i stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors in the series to die off.

was unlucky enough to see this while travelling by coach across africa. it was far and away the worst film i have ever come across. deserves to be the #1 all-time worst ;-) no acting, no plot, very little speaking. lots of ape-like grunting though, in this hopelessly unlikely film. an unwitting self-satire - you'll either laugh at it or cry.

i remember seeing this film when i was about 10, one of my friends had it. at the time it was just a film as i was about 10ish and just thought of it as another action film.when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film. whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career. although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb, albeit i haven't seen any and don't really remember him too much.anyway, just to say that this film is really bad, in all ways it could be. i would love to see it again though :od

i would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic. but i dont only own 1, i actually own 2. its that good.well, when i say good, i mean bad. but i will try to do a thorough review. i even watched 'born a ninja' which one of the other reviewers here mentioned, to compare it to this. and born a ninja is actually worse, but not quite as funny.and is this ever funny. everything about this movie is poor. everything. the plot is absolutely stuffed (note the 'you'll need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife'). every action sequence is stuffed too. our hero danton is more than a hero; he can stab people with twigs, take 3 bullets in the heart at 50 cm away without even bleeding, and tie a rope up to a tree which, when an enemy steps on it, ties a knot around the enemies leg, picks him up, and throws him 50 metres into a bunch of spikes.the acting is so bad it is impossible to comment on it, but it should have you rolling, especially dantons 'jump out of the ground and growl at the bad guy'. oh yes, and the bad guys: somehow, it seems they resurrect themselves 5 times each in the movie. perhaps it's just that there weren't enough actors, but in a movie of this calibre? i doubt that.the 'plot' is about how danton was a soldier in the vietnam war, and now his colonel is hunting real people for training for his mercenaries. the colonel just happens to pick up danton, then danton fights back. this is just the excuse for a rambo clone, with most of the movie being danton slaughtering soldiers. and i really cant explain the plot any more cos there is nothing else to the movie. it still rocks though.what else could be wrong you ask? dont get me started. hand grenades which actually go off at the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of a match.scenes where there are 5 people chasing danton, then the camera cuts away and back and there are 7. the way that every time danton loads the grenade launcher he is against the same background even though he is in completely diffrent locations. and the worst part is when danton pushes the plastic boulders onto the enemies, and one enemy is completely untouched by the boulders, so he doesn't know what to do so he half heartedly dies without even being touched. it's ridiculous!!!but funny. very, very funny. this is one of the few movies i can thoroughly recommend to everybody, cos if you dont find it funny, you are 1 in a million. and for the rest of us it's magic.

skeletons in the closet takes the father-teenage son genre to new levels of low. this is a movie that serves no purpose. the plot is layed out in the first few minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are cliché and despite plot twists that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything plays out exactly as you think it will. halfway through the movie i could no longer stand the snail pace and started fast forwarding. the movie ended exactly as i expected. linda hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction. if you really believe you need to see this uninspired lackluster wannabe whodunit, watch it on fast forward.

i was invited to view this film at a small art museum screening. i had no clue what to expect. i was initially optimistic in the opening credits to see judd nelson, bill paxton, wayne newton, james cann, rob lowe, and lara-flynn-boyle listed. however after some very disturbing grossed-out scenes (that did not add much to the story advancement), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. the gimmick of the vestigial growing arm storyline is never really developed. i patiently kept waiting for this film to cash-in. there was a small payoff in the end, but having to invest and sit through the the endless gross, crude, sexually-perverted, in-your-face screaming, unfunny gore cost too much for me (even for a free viewing). what were these established actors doing in this awful film? the art direction was very convincing and creepy. at the very minimum, it should only be a 75-minute film. this is a film that dick cheney and donald rumsfeld would embrace.

this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it. the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot.i'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton (who i feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). a freak accident alters nelson's career course and mayhem ensues.the attempts at humor were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing - comedically or otherwise.overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon. at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space. this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. one of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness.

ok, fans, it's out on dvd. but the only reason to watch this is 1) to say you did (due to its notoriety), or 2) if you're a hardcore bill paxton fan. i am not a hardcore bp fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom. it's a shame, because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence (and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson). sure it's gross, but it's bad, and not in a good way. if after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and dystopianly filthy this movie is you are still interested, do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead. films by john waters, david lynch, peter jackson's "braindead", henenlotter's "basket case", etc., all come to mind. there's lots better out there.

teenager tamara (jenna dewan) has it rough. she's ridiculed by all the popular "kids" for being shy, bookish, frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft. all of the football players and cheerleaders are especially angry at her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school paper. on top of this, her dad's a drunk, her mom's not around and she's secretly in love with her supportive english teacher (matthew marsden). the popular kids set up a cruel prank to humiliate her, accidentally kill her during a struggle, bury the body in the woods and make a pact to keep silent. to their shock, the very next day tamara walks back into the classroom looking seductive and, uh, dressed to kill. yep, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved. she also takes time out to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her english teacher away from his wife (claudette mink), a guidance counselor at the school.acting and writing are strictly mediocre. you can also tell the people responsible for this have seen such movies as carrie (1976), hello mary lou: prom night ii (1987) and the craft (1996) because it borrows wholesale from all three of those superior films. there's some gore (a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing his eyeball probably being the best bit), a nasty vomiting scene and a few campy/witty one-liners. not an awful film by any means, but not much originality went into it either.

"tamara" just felt like another teen oriented knock-off of the "i know what you did last summer" trend and is painfully dull. a high school outcast, who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods, vowing to tell no one. the next day, the supposedly "dead" tamara, arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would-be killers and has a little revenge... this is basically a combination of "carrie", "the craft", and every other straight-to-video, teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. the actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high schoolers. there is some gore, which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldn't wait for it to end. if you like modern garbage than i insist you seek this one out, otherwise don't bother...

i saw this movie, and i do like horror movies.i did not know what to expect, but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it. the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. especially jenna dewan as the exciting/evil tamara.the hardest thing about horror movies, is to make a good ending. but there the movie failed. for a change, a end-scene in a hospital, where suddenly all employees are gone. first you see doctors and nurses running around, but then they all went home?no cries for help while being chased by tamara, escaping to the roof (also a smart move...not) and off course a kind of open ending.no....the movie started great, the main part was nice to watch, but they really messed up the ending using all clichés from bad horror movies. jeffrey reddick failed in my eyes with this movie, after making some really quality movies like final destination 1 and 2.if you like a good horror full of cliché endings, tamara is a good movie to watch. for me, i like movies which surprise me.

i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free- thank god, had i paid for it my review would be less forgiving.well, the major idea of the film (geeky girl takes bloody revenge) isn't all that original, there are several parallels to "carrie" (playing a mean practical joke on a loser, except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her, tamaras and carries bad family background). i still think it's a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn't take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things.what worked: i liked the actress that played tamara. she looked great (when she was hot) and her catty lines were fun ("sean can't come to the phone. he's f**king patrick!").what didn't work: the whole wicca thing was silly. i generally prefer rational explanations (she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge). there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad (when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue- please!!!)the whole idea wasn't bound for oscar buzz, but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had. it was bearable but far from good!

star rating: ***** unmissable **** very good *** okay ** you could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs the tale of the titular adam (mark o' halloran) and paul (tom murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of dublin and their daily amblings about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day. along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years.i know a lot of irish people like to drink, but it seems some of them have problems with heroin, too by the looks of this movie. i know there is a bit of a drug problem over there, like there is in many parts of the world, so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing.i don't recall the last irish movie i saw (the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film i've seen lately!) and, judging from that, obviously i'm not as enlightened on their humour as i could be. the film is rather funny in certain parts, but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to raise near-the-knuckle laughs. the scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and i'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn't put a smile on my face! it's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to-and-fro. in light of this, some may find the ending sad, others may see it as just desserts.overall, i just failed to see the point to the film. i didn't see any motivation in the 'story' it was telling. it just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way. unlike trainspotting (which dealt with similar themes!) it's an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it's very short 83 minute running time. really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day. **

i saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because i felt it was a waste of time. the idea to make a film through the eyes of a headsman - one of the "evil guys" throughout most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers plenty of possibilities but... the film couldn't catch one of them. i was not feeling for any of the characters, the plot was all too predictable (to the point that i followed it)and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit. those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a headsman in the middle ages, a social outcast to that time, might be disappointed.

this had the promise of being an interesting film. the subject matter was certainly a promising one - the excesses of the catholic church during the counter-reformation. however, not only was this not developed (other than a two paragraph introduction), many things were not explained - i.e. the gypsies, the anabaptists, the inquisitors and their relationship to the one true church. nor were the politics of the time explained, i.e. the relationship between the catholic church and its supporters like the holy roman emperor. though these may have been apparent to an austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes it confusing for americans.but perhaps it's a good thing that they didn't emphasize the history since what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway. instruments of torture, bloody executions, witch and heretic burnings, big shiny swords and pretty golden reliquaries are the stars of the film. it could have just as easily been one of those conan-type sword and sorcery movies, only with period costumes...

the biggest problem with "in search of historic jesus" is that there is very little search to it at all. shick-sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and just into the '80s, which featured interviews with "experts" and discussion of "science" and "facts" to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on.sadly, "historic jesus" is really little more than a third-rate dramatization of the life of christ. unlike shick-sunn's more superior "in search of noah's ark" which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be, this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence. the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned, but little other detective work is given much screen time.for fans of these quasi-documentary films like "jupiter menace" and "in search of bigfoot", etc., this movie doesn't offer much.

as a documentary, this is laughable in a campy sort of way -- a schlocky collection of re-created biblical tableaux mixed in with solemn interviews of so-called "experts." think of it as an infommercial which pushes jesus instead of thigh-masters. however, the detailed crucifixion scene is, in terms of historical accuracy, superior to similar scenes in such widescreen hollywood extravaganzas as "ben-hur," "king of kings," and "the greatest story ever told." rather than dragging his entire cross to golgotha, for example, john rubinstein simply carries his crossbeam strapped across his shoulders to his outstretched arms. nails aren't driven through his palms but instead through his wrists. his feet aren't nailed separately but one is placed over the other so that just one nail need be used. incidentally, rubinstein's flogging prior to his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book, "lash! the hundred great scenes of men being whipped in the movies."of course, rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths, which probably isn't true to the shameful reality of roman crucifixions, but allowances must be made. curiously, the "good" thief is positioned on the left hand of jesus, which goes against a long-standing tradition. just why this thief is played by a pudgy, overweight man is, however, a mystery, especially in view of the fact that the "bad" thief is something of a "hunk."

am not from america, i usually watch this show on axn channel, i don't know why this respected channel air such sucking program in prime time slot. creation of hollywood's money bank jerry bruckheimer, this time he is spending a big load of cash in the small screen. in each episode a bunch of peoples having two team members travels from on country to another for a great sum of money; where the camera crews shoot their travels. i don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. it has nothing to watch for, in all episodes we see people ran like beggars, some times shouting, crying, beeping, jerky camera works..huh it's harmful to both eyes and ears. the most disgusting part in the race is the viewers finally knows each of the team members can't enjoy their race/traveling experience. even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in one shows, sucking american reality show.it's nothing to watch for, better switch to another channels.the amazing race = the disgusting show.

scarlet dawn casts douglas fairbanks, jr. as a russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the russian revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. he's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work. doug might have been caught by the reds but for the fact that his former servant nancy carroll didn't give him away. nancy's got a big old crush on doug and they do marry once arriving in exile in istanbul which throughout the film is referred to by its former christian name of constantinople. they marry and settle down with doug now reduced to washing dishes.but fairbanks's former mistress lilyan tashman who's always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once accustomed to as part of a swindle against father and daughter american tourists guy kibbee and sheila terry. good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes, usually those were given to b westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic. the ending is rather unbelievable. doug knew he was in a thanksgiving special and really overacts to cover up the defects of a unbelievable story.what i didn't understand was that fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new soviet union? that didn't make sense to me at all.i'd only see this if i was a dedicated fan of any the main players.

this movie has lots of action and little heart. let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the russian revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. in fact, the czar abdicated after world war i proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw russia from the war. now, back to our story.here we have the revolution being "rumored" in russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman baron nikita 'nikki' krasnoff (douglas fairbanks jr.). he flees his home with his former servant girl tanyusha (nancy carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in constantinople. before the revolution the baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. the revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. it certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. tanyusha follows the baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on nikki hand and foot. once in constantinople, nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, russian aristocrat vera zimina, who has a plan for getting them to paris where the tsarists have congregated after the revolution. unfortunately for tanyusha, vera's plan does not include her.this film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress nancy carroll. she does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. lilyan tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as russian vamp vera. lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. guy kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an american tourist who is curious about the russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland.

this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. the alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant "galaxy" but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. a better title for the film would be "it came from the planet of plot contrivances." the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. any thought to the passage of time is ignored. now it's a couple days after meeting the alien, then bam! all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour. do yourself a favor and miss this movie. you will make yourself stupider for having watched it. the ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going "ta-da!!!!" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it. if you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself ("enemies of freedom"--honestly) laughing, you're retarded.

an intelligent summation of cold war era mutually assured destruction policy, up until the conclusion: it's a gasser! all russians and chinese are obliterated from the face of the earth! saw this one at the 27th annual cwru science fiction marathon, january 2002.

i made sure to see this film because it is a 1950s sci-fi film--one of my favorite genres. unfortunately, while i was looking forward to either bug-eyed aliens or power-mad conquerers, the aliens in this film were a major disappointment! first, you only see one very briefly at the beginning (and he looked pretty ordinary) and you also only got a tiny glimpse of a spaceship! second, the alien was neither the evil conquerer or the benevolent friend of mankind--but a real odd-ball. and finally, the plot itself seemed so dumb, preachy and heavy-handed that it elicited more yawns than thrills.as the film begins, five people from five different parts of the world (germany, britain, russia, china and the usa) are kidnapped by an alien. the alien gives each of them devices by which they can destroy all life on the planet if they so choose--because, the alien admits that his race of people would love to inhabit the earth but they themselves won't kill to get it. then, he returns them all. while it's 100% obvious that no one would want to use these devices, the alien then announces on tv the identities of the five without telling that the weapons are that powerful! so, all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five going into hiding and one being tortured to get him to reveal how the device works--as the soviets want to use it!!! this part of the film just seemed pretty silly. sure the ussr was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but it's fact--especially under stalin), they never would have thought of using it like they did in the movie! later, one of the five (the german scientist), somehow figures out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the evil people who hate freedom. so, he uses it to wipe out all the evil commies and presumably others who were anti-freedom and the world then becomes a paradise!! preachy, silly and full of plot holes--this movie just isn't worth your time, though it is an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses communism--in particular, the tensions between nato and the soviets.

this is another of hollywood's anti-communist polemics of the golden 1950s. stalwart american gene barry, lovely englishwoman valerie french, and three others are kidnapped by an alien and given clamshells containing fantastic--and fantastically vague--power. what will the earthlings do with such power? toss it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of mankind? anybody who knows american cinema circa 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do, but the story gets ripe when the americans actually test the things in the middle of the pacific. then one scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! his smarmy attitude afterward is nauseating, and the cheery disposition of everyone else is appalling.here's the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only "confirmed enemies of freedom"! that's right--don't worry about the ethical conundrum of killing everyone that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom; just do it! hurray! no commies! silly female--and you threw yours into the sea! ha ha! kiss me, baby!

just listen to the broadway cast album and to the voices of barbara harris and john cullum, who do wonders for the wonderful lerner and lane score. then, with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind, watch the movie, with streisand as streisand, and yves montand reading his lines with such a heavy french accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. the best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what montand does to the introductory part of the title song. listen as he sings/says: could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue, what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do? (that one part sums up the problem that results from casting "name stars" in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) i can just see rex harrison entering that scene and suggesting montand, too, could learn to do justice to the beauty of the english language.

"on a clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a new age update of the "pygmalion" / "my fair lady" story: a professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman. this time, however, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression.you know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music. the songs are instantly forgettable. (no "get me to the church on time" here, i'm afraid.) and the plot goes nowhere. to paraphrase gertrude stein, there is no "there" here. the characters wander through the story without ever getting from point a to point b. professor chabot claims several times that he will get to the root of daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do so.all meaningful conflict is avoided. for instance, there comes a time when chabot's university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position. now there is conflict! will he give up his career for daisy? alas! nothing comes of this development. a scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells chabot to continue on with his work. so much for conflict.the talent was certainly assembled for this movie: directed by vincente minnelli. written, in part, by alan jay lerner. a cast of yves montand, bob newhart and jack nicholson. and, oh yes, starring barabara striesand who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career.but it all falls flat. lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned "my fair lady," is as doomed to failure as daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past.if you enjoy movie musicals, there are far better choices than this.

in trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached, oacd,ycsf was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization. here it's past life regression, esp and hypno-therapy... pretty loopy! the real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; just where can a movie go, and what can happen, when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand? it can't go any place new, but strangely, it can't even go any place old! indeed, if it could, audiences would still have no interest in the union of yves montand (playing a much older, arrogant, french ass) and streisand. (a much younger girl). we never become invested in them, their situations or outcomes. montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible.it's all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable; despite efforts here and there from minelli that are respectable. it's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success... that's just too passe! streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer, as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. but she over-relies on her ingratiating (translation: irritating) kooky, jewish girl shtick. she can however sing very well, at both the "gentle" and "powerhouse" ends of the range. amidst a score of musical dross, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs* of much higher caliber than anything fanny or dolly had to offer. 'he isn't you' is a sweet trifle as sublime as lorenz hart's 'my funny valentine,' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between chabot and melinda.the only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film. strong research shows a longer, better-explained and more decorative, but not necessarily a better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. you can be sure there's be more babs in that version but more importantly, there'd be more thoughtful work from minelli.in the end montand sends babs off to sing the title song, after she discovers he's a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook. and she takes the bait. so, uh... hooray for that.(*hurry it's lovely up here, love with all the trimmings, he isn't you, & the title song)

last time i checked, the nazis didn't win the second world war - not that you'd sodding notice. after all, the third reich was pretty big on issuing orders and demanding cold, robotic obedience from the populace, and that's pretty much what we're saddled with today. but the way the orders are delivered has changed. instead of being barked at in a german accent through a loudhailer, they're disguised as concerned expert advice and floated under your nose every time you switch on the tv or flip open a newspaper there's a continual background hum, a middle-class message of self-improvement, whispered on the wind."you eat too much. you eat the wrong things. you drink. you smoke. you don't get enough exercise. you probably can't even *beep* properly. you'll die if you don't change your ways. your health will suffer. have you got no self-respect? look at you. you sicken me. i pity you. i hate you. we all hate you. god hates you. don't you get it? it's so sad, what you're doing to yourself. it's just so bloody sad." that's the mantra. and it goes without saying that the people reciting it are routinely depicted as saints. last year, the media dropped to its knees to give jamie oliver a collective blow job over his school dinners series, in which he campaigned to get healthier food put on school menus. given the back-slapping reaction, you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd personally rescued 5,000 children from the jaws of a slavering paedophile.anyway, the series was a huge success. in fact in telly terms there was only one real drawback: it wasn't returnable. after all, when you've saved every child in the nation from certain death once, you can't really do it a second time. the only solution is to find a new threat, which brings us to ian wright's unfit kids (wed, 9pm, c4), a weekly "issuetainment" programme in which the former footballer and renowned enemy of grammar forces a bunch of overweight youngsters to take part in some extra-curricular pe.it's essentially a carbon copy of the jamie oliver show, with more sweating and fewer shots of pupils mashing fresh basil with a pestle: an uplifting fable in which wrighty shapes his gang of misfits into a lean, mean, exercising' machine - combating apathy and lethargy, confronting lazy parents, and attempting to turn the whole thing into a nationwide issue that'll have range rover mums everywhere dampening their knickers with sheer sanctimony in between trips to the conran shop. oh isn't it simply terrible, what these blob-some plebes do to themselves? not our josh you understand: he eats nothing but organic spinach and attends lacrosse practise six hundred times a week.bet he does, the little sh1t yes, it is heartwarming to watch flabby, inconvenient kids transforming themselves with a bit of simple activity... but there's something about the underlying eat-your-greens message that really sticks in my craw, in case you hadn't guessed.what happened to the concept of choice, you *beep* so a bit of jogging might increase your life expectancy - so what? that just equates to a few more years in the nursing home - whoopee do. and besides, i'd rather drop dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of smug toss ends trying to out-health one another.in episode two, video games and the internet are singled out as villains in the war on flab: they make kids too sedentary, you see. oddly enough, tv, which is equally sedentary, and unlike those two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy along with your physique, escapes without a rollicking. funny that.well listen here, channel 4 - instead of forcing kids to eat bracken or do squat-thrusts, how about teaching them to think more expansively, so they reject the sly, cajoling nature of programmes like this? or would that be a campaign too far?

the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad jobs, and on and on. they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves. however, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be wealthy, successful, and attractive. tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt. if nutrition is really that important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods. if they really believed in their computer simulations, i'd like to see them do a double-blind test by finding some 40-year-olds, finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children, and age-progressing the kids' photos. then compare to the real things. hey, that sounds like a project for mythbusters! discovery channel--are you listening?tlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons.

well, i don't normally think there's such a thing as a horrible movie, but this is pretty damned close! the best acting performance in the whole thing was snoop dogg, who has one line in a 10 second scene. i agree with the "glad it was short" review. the music videos at the end were cool though.

this movie rips off of every mobster/gangster film ever made. mp da last don has a reference to every movie. the acting was by far the worst i have every seen. who the hell is john mario anyway? his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen. he makes bad actors look good. as far as master p goes, he's selling out quicker than an n*sync concert. i really wish i was there to tell the whole production company: what the hell were you thinking when penning the script?" obviously these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out their gangster lives for real in their minds. one thing i do know is that there wasn't anyone who wanted to distribute this film so it seems (and how predictable) that the guys at no limit had to start; no limit films. i've said enough! this movie is terrible and it does not deserve to be called a movie!

when i saw this movie i think i was a freshman in high school and i still feel like charging master p for the hour & 20 mins or so that he took from my life that i'll never get back.the guy who already posted is completely right. master p is a wannabe mobster. he, like all the other rappers in this country made his millions off of selling rap cds to young impressionable white kids in this country. it's widely known that the mob was not a black thing and blacks were not allowed to be part of it. unfair as that might be rappers can't deal with. this movie paints master p as a mobster named nino? the script is terrible with the acting to match. completely unbelievable. while searching i came up with a link or something that said he was planning on making another movie called "the black sopranos"!!!!please spare us that and stick to nickalodeon. you are not a white mobster, your not even a good actor master p, please stick to your music for the sake of whoever listens to it these days...

this is one entertaining flick. i suggest you rent it, buy a couple quarts of rum, and invite the whole crew over for this one. my favorite parts were.1. the gunfights that were so well choreographed that john woo himself was jealous, .2. the wonderful special effects .3. the academy award winning acting and .4. the fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to be doing a bad "scarface" impersonation. i mean, master p as a cuban godfather! this is groundbreaking territory. and with well written dialogue including lines like "the only difference between you and me rico, is i'm alive and your dead," this movie is truly a masterpiece. yeah right.

this has to be one of, if not the greatest mob/crime films of all time. every thing about this movie is great, the acting in this film is of true quality; master p's acting skills make you actually believe he is italian! the cinematography is excellent too, probably the best ever. this movie was great; and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm.

on the scale of 1 to 10, i gave this a 4. i thought the film was not very good, with too much violence and not one character to like.on an erotic scale, i give this a 6. many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness. i always enjoy nudity, and nancy travis and faye grant come through, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.

this is one of the films that killed the "spaghetti" western. it not only loses something in the translation, it is a total chaotic mess of editing as well. either chunks of it have been edited out and or re-edited for an english language version. in any case, it makes little or no sense, period. it makes the "trinity" and the eastwood "man with no name" films look like john ford/john wayne by comparison. nothing in this film is original. somewhere in there is a beginning, a middle, and (finally)an end. except for the end, not everything is exactly in that order. robert wood seems personable enough. the rest of the cast, especially the women, should have made better career choices.

this is the first film i've watched from the italian ed wood, demofilo fidani aka miles deem. the above title was superfluously added later on since there exists another similarly titled 1961 movie starring richard basehart which was hammer films' michael carreras' one and only stab at the western; the genuine italian title was originally translated as his name was sam walbash, but they called him amenalthough it was actually wallach in the italian variant which, of course, implies a tribute of sorts to hollywood actor eli! while certainly not unwatchably bad, instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that i was often cracking up into howls of laughter: a horrid number by a would-be irresistible french chanteuse; a totally irrelevant bar-room brawl; actors doing somersaults when being shot; an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine; ineffective use (indeed abuse) of slow-motion; and, easily the most preposterous, seeing gordon mitchell and lincoln tate play two gunfighters (sporting the actors' own names!) hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all!! lead actor robert woods is just that even down to ineffectively whispering the amens over the bodies of his victims. supporting actress simonella vitelli (actually, the director's own daughter!) as the villain's broad is quite a looker but, unfortunately, she doesn't get to do much in the film  despite having a change of heart towards the end. the main musical theme is actually pretty good but, again, the title song is, in itself, quite lousy.

oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: david hasselhoff. the 80's are back with vengeance in witchery, an american-italian co-production, helmed by infamous joe 'd'amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) fabrizio laurenti directing . marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi's evil dead series in italy (that was dubbed "la casa" in there), witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.a mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious wtf surprise climax. (i just love the look on her face...) surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.the plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. i only felt sorry for linda blair, who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about. don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun. it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror. and speaking of hearts - every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors, must have it's one on the right place.this is my truth - what is yours?

i absolutely hated this movie! i was 9 when i saw it. it is the only movie i have ever walked out of in the theater. my mom, dad, and i all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. this movie stole approximately 45 minutes of my life. everything about it was ridiculous. the entire premise was too warped. being 9, i was always easily entertained. this movie proved that i couldn't subject myself to anything and still be entertained.

if it were possible, i would have given this sorry excuse for a movie a zero star. it was by far the worse i have ever seen. it was as if it were a home movie that some bored highschoolers decided to make as a joke. the "acting" was horrific. the "actors" didn't even react to the fact that they were being murdered.honestly, i bought this movie by mistake. the spanish title said jeepers creepers 3, so i thought hmm maybe it'll be ok. wrong. it was honestly the worst ever. i didn't get past 20 minutes of the stupid movie. i skipped through chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happen.the cameramen were also terrible. it was like a home movie. i would never recommend anyone to watch this. terrible terrible moronic movie.

this is just about the worst piece of garbage i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. the story was embarrassingly amateurish, the graphics were horrible, and the acting... i've never seen worse acting in my entire life. a kindergarten class could come up with a scarier, better written, and more entertaining concept than this. i pity anyone who wastes their time on this film, as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job. it was obvious that they were not given appropriate direction. the writers must have spent their time at film school in the "back room" playing peaknuckle. a lot of professors wasted a lot of time on these two. i would be truly embarrassed to admit that i knew them.

i rented this movie under the impression that it was "scarecrow 3:dark harvest", thinking it was a continuation in the scarecrow slayer series (another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies). i wasn't disappointed though. it was just as awful, if not worse, than what i expected. i was laughing throughout the entire movie. every piece of bad acting, poorly shot and cut footage, and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting.the special features include a pathetic view into the cast and crew's six months of filming.favorite line, "the sins of my forefathers! they've trickled down to this very moment of time!"

as you may remember i have seem all three of the trilogy of trash and the first movie is the only one even remotely close to be watchable. part two was low grade sewage and this installment is slightly better then two, but still one steaming pile of something i removed from my backyard last monday. the premise doesn't make sense, why did the moonshiners murder that poor old lady and even in 1921 i think someone would notice a bunch of oily guys where a sweet little old lady once lived. second, that scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first movie. it's just old clothes and a burlap sack. let's face it, the series is garbage and should be forgotten about. the noose!

i couldn't spoil this piece of crap if i wanted to. after watching dark harvest 1 i thought "this has got to be the worse movie ever made" then i watched dark harvest 2 and that made 1 seem a little better. then i watched dark harvest 3 or tried too. the only thing i have to say is "when is this going to end?" very bad acting and really bad special effects the only good thing about this movie was the boob shot. don't waste your time of money on this piece of crap... and now i have to write 3 more lines to get this to submit. i was going to sing a song but i can't think of any right now. but the movie finally ended (though it had an ending that might mean they are going to make another one of these)

ok i gave this a three a three! it deserves only one star no questions asked.if your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a legit b-horror movie than yes it will get one star. but i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crap.with this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more "hollywood" but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish. we laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedy.the acting is terrible..... the effects and death sequences are so bad.... the story complete crap.....but the fact they are trying to make a serious horror movie..priceless!the most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed "dark basement" which is clearly lit, and they pretend to not be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling bahahahaha just terrible.....so if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is, along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this movie....wait why am i writing so much? no one knows about this movie...i doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.

it used to be that video distributors like sub rosa and brain damage films would release low-budget, shot-on-video horror films to a select market of gorehounds that ate them up with glee. that's acceptable to me, because you could see these movies from a mile away with their shoddy box art and cheesy titles.now we have lions gate getting into the mix, only they have decided that it'd be better to sucker in poor saps by putting a "professional" looking cover on it and charge the same price as one of their higher-budget, professionally made features. do not be suckered in by this! granted, if you've seen dark harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it is not on a video store shelf beside professionally-made features.i am a fan of independent cinema and have watched several low budget, shot-on-video productions that were still a worthy rental but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the "acting" (if you can call it that) was abysmal. it was amusing to laugh at the horrible line reading for a minute or two, but eventually it was too much to take and became unbearable. the story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow manages to be even worse. the only possible saving grace to this would be one disemboweling scene that still manages to be awful but is an award winning effect when compared to the blood splatters after a girl is slapped or the mannequin decapitation.it took me three tries to make it through this entire movie and i only did so because i paid good money to rent it and felt like i should at least finish it all the way through. stay away - stay far, far away from this one.

dark harvest 3: scarecrow: 1 out of 10: in einstein's theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time. (or so i've heard) in other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change. even on fast-forward (and you will be reaching for that fast forward button) it clocks in somewhere around eternity.if you are familiar with lionsgate's own version of project greenlight (this is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local wal-mart) you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within.the line reading (i refuse to call it acting) is uniformly awful. this is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of schlitz. the camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scene.the story is awful, the sets are from a haunted halloween put on by adhd middle school students and once again the line reading (remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracting beyond mere words. avoid.

spoilers: the original road house is one of those movies that i know is clichéd and unoriginal, yet it's done so well, i'm embarrassed to admit i really like it. turns out many of my friends, whose movie opinions i respect, think the same way. so when they attempt to make a sequel to it and it's as if it was written by some high school kids who were given the rights to do a sequel, it's just bad; really, really bad.oddly, johnathon schaech is listed as one of the writers and i can only hope his wga membership is revoked. the writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialog in this millennium. schaech already appearing to be the king of the straight-to-dvd sequel (8mm 2, poison ivy 2) and now after seeing this and 8mm 2, i'm thinking his acting ability is non-existent. he was awful, just awful.and it's not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, they're bad. every fight scene is a slowly delivered punch (yet still making the "wiff" sound in the air) that is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground. this is repeated throughout the film, worse than any bad 1970s cop show. or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of cherry kool-aid for some reason. and we're supposed to believe will patton is a fighting machine; his fight scenes look so amazingly fake i was honestly embarrassed watching. it's the complete lapses of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible. for instance: johnathon schaech's character is in town for a day and already tells some girl he barely knows who he has no idea what side she's on, "i'm with the feds, but don't tell anyone." the female villain, who fights the good girl in one fight scene with acrobatics that rival any super hero, yet is easily held down by the will patton, "old guy," in another scene by simply holding both her hands while he utters some ridiculous line ("stab me once, shame on you, stab me twice, ain't gonna happen" whew, that's bad) and then head-butts her. jake busey's villain shoots at the feds while caught in the middle of a drug deal, yet no dea agents or anyone simply go to his place and pick him up after, in fact, he's simply let go because "this is the sheriff's territory." busey wants the bar because it's "in a great location" for drug deals, yet his own house appears to be just as good apparently offering all the perks the bar is supposed to have. johnathon schaech's character is supposed to be the son of patrick swayze's character in the original, yet swayze's character's last name is dalton and schaech's isn't (nor is the supposed brother of swayze's character). and johnathon schaech looks about 50 in this movie. i looked it up, he's 17 years younger than swayze, but he looks awful.but my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most stock fight scene ending in movies: the villain is knocked through a window on a second floor and as they pan down i'm thinking "please don't tell me he's impaled on something..." and sure enough, my worst fears were realized.actually, i could go on for another half hour about the things i hated about this movie. suffice to say, let's put an end to these ridiculous straight-to-dvd sequels to theatrical movies, at least the ones with johnathon schaech.

this in-name-only sequel to the classic roadhouse has a dea agent (john schaech) coming to the rescue of his uncle (will patton) when the uncle is badly beaten up by a local drug gang, headed by that wooden indian of an actor jake busey. the gang wants to take over the poor guy's bar for nefarious reasons. patrick swayze is sorely missed here. schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass-kicking lawman. the fights here are intermittent and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in roadhouse. the finale is equally weak. some good-looking women keep things afloat for a bit. there is a terrific fight between a daisy duke-type who turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons, and a nasty-looking babe of busey's who is handy with sharp implements. there's also a scantily dressed gal at the beginning who is a fellow agent of schaech's, but unfortunately she never reappears in the film. too bad. she does a brief lap dance for schaech that had my full attention. if nothing else, roadhouse 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that comes darned close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in any movie. the rest is snooze time.

"direct-to-video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless its a direct-to-video sequel to something that went direct-to-video in the first place. despite this, studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct-to-video sequels over the years to cult hits. i don't think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels rank among some of the worst titles of all time, including the hitcher ii, starship troopers 2, and cruel intentions 3. it's fitting that road house 2 was helmed by scott ziehl as he was also the man in charge of ruining the cruel intentions series. like his entry in the cruel intentions trilogy, ziehl takes elements that made the first road house a great guy flick, and rehashes them with no success whatsoever. this is no sequel, this is a remake all the way. various lines from the original are repeated, plot points cut and pasted, and scenes are replicated almost shot-for-shot from the first one. the one thing that could not be duplicated were the amazing fight scenes, which made road house what it was. here, we get clumsily directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour. compare that with its predecessor's fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare. ziehl is capable of directing action as he did well with the 2001 remake of earth vs. the spider, but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess. it's not completely his fault, as the screenplay is very, very poorly written and clunky. i don't care if something goes direct-to-video, a good script is still required. someone should keep that mind while continuously churning these low-budget, direct-to-dvd movies out. skip it entirely. 1/10

well let's be fair. following up a cult classic like road house is no easy task. now subtract swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task. so with patrick not on board whose bonehead idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage? i am going to blame the director who didn't even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film. i was actually shocked they got will patton (armaggedon) to jump on board. johnathon schaech did an ok job with the lead but the writing was atrocious. turning down his partner brunette bombshell (crystal mantecon) in the film's first 5 minutes made me want to eject it right there. but i stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the double duece. no such luck. the cover of the dvd is hilarious, they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film. costar ellen hollman actually puts in a decent performance as well. but again the effort is futile in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this. has jake busey ever been cast in a decent film? could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment? even one of the old bouncers or two, or jeff healey for a performance would have been nice. take this film out of your queue immediately. -lostflix

this movie is a pile of rubbish , and to try and base it the first is just a farce , the main thing that let it down for me was the usage of the one liners out of the first one , which once said by classic actors such as sam elliot can not be reproduced in any way , i mean when dalton phones wade in the 1st , and he ends the call with stay cool that was great , but when the chump rings the dea agent back home and he ends the call with stay cool it doesn't have the same ring now really does it , there are other ones but i cant be bothered to post em up , but i hope u get my drift ,they should of named this roadhouse wannabe ..........

man stop making sequels to great movies. the original was a great movie that was over the top with fights,sex,and one of the coolest characters that graced the screen in the 90's. the story is believable as if your been to bars in the outs of the south you would know. but here comes this piece of junk roadhouse 2 last call. lets just hope they are serious with the title and never make another roadhouse ever again.it doesn't have the charm of the characters of the original nor is the story really believable. the story is more of a steven segal type action that even though roadhouse 2 is a b movie it still doesn't click as some b movie action still sales the movie no matter how cheesy it is. the only reason to rent not buy this movie is that we finally find out the one question is left from the original roadhouse. patrick swayze's character dalton, is dalton his first name or last name? well i'll save you the $4.00 rental fee. dalton is his first name as in dalton tanner. never make another roadhouse!!!!!!!!!!!

i happened to see a promo for this movie on spike channel last night, it was grouped with a patrick swazy rerun of another movie he made and thought swazy was in this sequel.....boy was i wrong....i see the screen writer also starred in it, and i'm thinking the budget was a bit tight. i am surprised to see will patton in the film he has far better credits to his name to be playing in a "c" movie like this. bussey jr was trying so hard to portray the image of his father(one of the best bad guy actors ever) that failed miserably the only redeeming qualities in the movie was the chicks,,,,,good looking and with lots of t&a just not worth the time or your hard earned dollar to rent it

the original road house is by no means an award winning film. but it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. it shouldn't have been that hard to make a sequel. there's no need for a big budget, big name stars, and spectacular visual effects. even the story didn't have to be original. all it needed was a good time vibe, and some great fist fights. i don't mean matrix-style "wire-fu", just some well choreographed barroom brawls. lots of them. there are a couple of decent fights in the movie, but none of them are memorable, and the focus is more on gun play. plus, the way it ties in to the original film is laughable, bordering on insulting. johnathon schaech plays shane tanner, an undercover dea agent who is good with his hands and feet. but here's the kicker...he's the son of patrick swayze's character dalton!!!! say what????? let's see, the original road house was made in 1989. so for dalton to have a son in his late 20's (maybe even 30) in 2006...well you get the idea. they give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle nate (will patton) while his father "travelled around a lot". oh please. that itself almost warranted shutting this movie off. but i digress. schaech is completely out of his element. sure he can throw a couple of kicks, but he's got nothing going on as an actor. plus, he's referred to in the movie by the bad guys as "pretty boy". i've never scrutinized men that closely, but i don't think this guy is too good looking. he looks sick. his face is way too thin, and his sunken eyes make it look like he's going to pass out at any moment. i'd never heard of him before, but i think he should give up acting and go back to his day job. jake busey plays the local drug runner wild bill. busey is not a terrible actor. he was good in starship troopers, and even made a menacing villain in hitcher 2. but here, he just chews the scenery in standard bad guy mode. even his "threating" dialog is yawn worthy. we're supposed to buy him as the man that has the whole town in his pocket. but why? what does he do? because he wants to buy a bar from patton "by any means necessary"? ellen hollman has the token girlfriend role. a woman with a secret. too bad that secret is about as difficult to figure out as 2+2. she's the local elementary school teacher who happens to be a former army soldier. guess what that means? it means that while she may quiver with fear for the majority of the movie, she'll be ready to smash heads when the fur starts to fly. oh well, at least she's hot. actually the fight between her and wild bill's girl is the best one in the movie. it's fast, brutal, and entertaining. which leads me to my next problem with the movie...the fights. as i said schaech knows how to throw a punch. the same can't be said for anyone he faces in the movie. obviously the movie will all come down to schaech versus busey. busey is an actor, not a fighter. he doesn't possess the skills to pull of a movie fight. swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull off well choreographed fights. he also faced a couple of worthy opponents, and had one killer (literally) move. none of that here. with a couple of exceptions, the fights are forced, poorly staged, and routine. the punches sound like someone smacking a 2x4 on the concrete, and there's even a couple of parts where the sound doesn't even match up to the punch. it's embarrassing. there isn't even the good southern/redneck music of the original. road house had the jeff healy band, who were a somewhat popular band at the time. this movie features a singer called john otto, whose music is tepid, and his acting even worse. he's given one line in the movie, which was probably inserted to appease whatever fans he may have out there. either that, or someone owed him a favor. my final complaint about the movie is one that comes out of just being picky...the continuity. movies are shot out of sequence, and then it's the editor's job to piece it all together. well someone should give the editor of this movie a little shove. the problems range from little things like people not looking the same direction when a shot changes, to re-used footage at the end of the movie. in the beginning, we are introduced to the bar, the black pellican. as the camera moves through the bar, you see the band, the bouncers, and the people dancing. at the end of the movie, when the bad guys have been defeated, we get another shot of the same bar, with insert shots of our hero sitting at the bar with his girl. the problem is, the footage of the people in the bar is the same footage from the beginning of the movie!!! i kid you not. it's the same people, standing (or dancing) in the same places, wearing the same clothes. want to know the funniest part? you see bouncers in the shot that were killed earlier in the movie. do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie unless you feel the need to go out and punch someone. this movie will make you angry enough to do it.

if i had never seen the first road house, then i guess this movie might get one more star, but even then that makes it a 3 star movie. for that matter i was really surprised as to the relatively high rating it currently has.in reality, i was not able to finish this movie, as it was painful. where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it pretty much parallels the original exactly even though the original plot is still referenced. this doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. also, the acting is weak...i never felt like i was into the movie yet i felt like i was watching people act. even good actors like busey don't work out, probably due to the screenplay or maybe the awkward editing. the strangest thing is that the movie feels like a mid 90's b movie, yet is made in 06. i am not sure as to why, but then again, this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason. the music, the look, and the whole overall feel reminds me of movies you saw 10 years ago on cinemax late at night. the strangest thing of all is that i am also expecting ja rule to come in at some point...often it reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors.the most irritating thing is love interest girl who's character seems like a total rip off of the lois lane character on smallville which is also quite annoying. and lets not forget the fakest sounding "southern accents" i have heard since walk the line. i realize this is common place in movies, but no accent at all would work better than attempting to sound like you are from that universal hick place on tv where anyone from any southern state (or ky and wv) sound exactly the same. sure, people in desert towns in az sound just like people in southeastern states 2000+ miles away. that was wearing thin 10 years ago in the b movies where technique came from. why do writers / directors make such decisions? bottom line: i would truly not recommend this if you are a fan of road house or if you like good movies. also, if you have not seen it yet, don't spoil it by seeing this version first. the original road house was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over. it was an unexpected success like american graffiti, dazed and confused, and more recently office space, fast and furious (only the first one!), and napolean dynamite. why did they spoil it!!!???they should have never made a sequel to road house other than a high budget version with the right actors / director. sure, you can never top the original (ex: bad news bears, the longest yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it right it will be presentable as is the case with the examples i mentioned. but to make a low budget, off-network, self production of road house is criminal.

the original road house was a classic cheesy 80s movie, which although it didn't have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting, was a very enjoyable and popular film, largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast, along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy.16 years later, and mgm / sony attempts to re-create the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing... with a movie which quotes all the original's best one liners and recites the three rules.were this an amateur fan made film, it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayze's movies. as a professionally made film, it falls flat on it's face right into the dvd bargin bin, with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original.having said that, with new lines such as "i'm gonna kill you just like i killed your father" no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original script.i knew this was never going to be anything special, being a straight to dvd sequel, but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name, but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film, with a little narcotics added in.were i the director, i'd have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and it's characters. as it is, we got patrick swayze's character now supposed to be dead (killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey) and his brother and son now the main characters, who strangely enough have completely different surnames.my favourite part was that dalton's 'son' drove the same car his father did, a genuinely cool homage, although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did. that's a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the '89 movie.also of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane "just like i killed your father" and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner. amazing writing there. i see schaech is listed as co-screenwriter. stick to acting, or preferably, nothing.overall though, this is an ok film if there's nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half, or if you haven't seen the first road house, but hardcore fans of swayze's classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first. as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film, "even jeff healy is glad he won't be seeing this one!" stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days!

let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover. with that said, anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic, and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional. the film "is what it is." and what is that... a modest budget ($4 million, i estimate) studio sequel. the film isn't terrible, but for road house fans it will be a disappointment. and that brings me to problem one, just as dirty dancing wouldn't been what it was without swayze, road house isn't the same without him. the lead lacks depth, character, and likability to carry the film. i feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel. the other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like will patton along side day players who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag. busey, who i have seen do great characters seemed like he just mailed it in. ellen was played well, except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick. sherri, the dea agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress, yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped. the writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. instead opting for a base one dimensional film. which leads me to the biggest problem, the script... i got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an "and" and an "&." it looked very amateur. and that is what the writing was. i heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began. some cheezy parts of the film to watch for are... during the first undercover meeting, the obvious drug deal under the table. "hey lets meet at a crowded nudey bar, i will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table" wait! "make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!" second, i love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a lark 10 minutes later. there are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron. which brings me to the realism of the dea training, i won't both to get technical... but jumping thru doors isn't standard training... nor do typical female agents, who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field, act like weak characters... boring! thanks for the chauvinistic view heir director. there is other stuff i could teach a course at a school about it... the sped up fighting, the cheezy dialogue, the recycled story... etc... but aside from all that you just cannot like ex-mr. applegate, he totally lacks the humble zen coolness that made mr. patrick swayze such a bad ass. he just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass, but just like van damnit he runs into a real bad ass (chuck zito in van don't case) and he gives him a lesson about "badassdom." therefore, that i feel is the major linchpin of the film, if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass, you don't have to try. example: swayze! if you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things... then well... you are why your audience, the average joe... will not rent this film, and if they do they will write reviews like this.

this television show, is a idiotic waste of time if you want to learnabout animals watch the discovery channel. if you want to watchnincompoops on television just watch mtv. mtv stands for music televisionnot nitwit d-listers preforming retarded skits or bratty kids cryingtheir hearts out for not getting a bmw for there 16th birthday. i betthat if you like this show i bet you love viva la bam, and jackass huh? i think my iq dropped ten points watching this show. this is a combination of two shows jackass and the animal planetsome people think this is a good combination.i on the other hand think it is retardant.and if you notice its a lot like jackassand viva la bamjust a note, this show is horrible

spoilers!!i hate this one, but it is better than the others after this, they just keep getting worse. i hope gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one. a lot of the same with humor, ie the toilet, kids, etc. how much farther can we watch their relationship evolve. drugs, bad guys why south africa! i found that unbelievable, maybe south american, some country in the golden triangle would have made the script better. it seems the late 80' early 90's had the blond bad guys ie die hard, the mighty ducks play ice land gary busey in the last weapon, etc. hollywood repeats itself over. this one with a similar story has to go over the top. the attacking the police, the beach condo scene, and the fight at the end, and way over the top gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much. like many part 2's, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill. 3/10

riggs and murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. the story line is just awful! i mean really, south african diplomats smuggling the mythical krugerrands into the u.s. it's just painful! and the accents are absolutely abysmal! can no one get an afrikaans south african accent right? or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like drunken hollanders? the only guy who got the afrikaans accent right was tim robbins in catch a fire. another thing about this movie that i disliked was when danny glover so artlessly describes an afrikaans accent as being shitty! i mean what a slap in the face to the afrikaans. there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. i mean mel gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their p.a. type! don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film. if you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent die hard 2.

richard donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of south africa.it's not as if america is the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of rodney king and glorifies the police department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour. so donner's salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late = developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white south africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself? inside rudd's (joss ackland - eminently hissable) office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the fuhrerbunker and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point,he and his men are referred to as "nazis" at regular intervals. for me the only bright spot in the movie was when mel gibson turned up at an anti - apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription "end aparthied now". the intensely irritating joe pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly-trained puppy.this would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat,but sadly he survives to irritate another day. miss patsy kensit seems in a world of her own,perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite mel gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere.shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into mel's caravan to keep the u.s. army in iraq going for six months. fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack.i hope he got a special bone as a reward. the film climaxes(without interruption from mel's dog) on a cargo ship bound for nazi germany (sorry,south africa),when mel and danny murder so many members of the master race that i lost count.despite jiggling around like bonnie and clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets,mel survives,curled up in his partner's arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father.take that,apartheid!

the only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in ny during '81. as for the film itself it has at least three major flaws. first of all, there is narration throughout the film, which is not required at all. in the few places where there is some explanation necessary just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way. secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio, in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film. the third flaw was in the ending. i will not give the ending away for those brave souls that would endure the torture of sitting through the film, but it commits a cardinal sin in screenwriting. not worth the money or time it takes to see this, unless you are a fan of one of the represented bands.

an italian/american co-production co-starring linda blair and david 'the hoff' hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?well, based on the uneventful, extremely tedious, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, i would have said 'very easily'; thankfully, however, things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).the hoff stars as gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie (leslie cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project, a book about witches; whilst there, frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity.his plans for nookie are scuppered, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks (robert champagne and annie ross), their pregnant daughter jane (blair), son tommy (michael manchester), pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan (catherine hickland), and estate agent jerry (rick farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel.after explaining their unexpected presence on the island, gary and leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it perilous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (hildegard knef), who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. one by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs), before meeting a terrible fate.none of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (manchester as tommy is particularly bad, whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; jerry is crucified and burnt alive; linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and gary gets stabbed in the back.oh, and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed (again).

talented screenwriter alvin sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in los angeles despite mom's flighty behavior. apart from several good sequences, i didn't quite buy susan sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady), and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. natalie portman fares much better as her kid, and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one where she asks a boy to strip, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). certainly not an incompetent piece, "anywhere but here" does have moments that work, but it isn't an embraceable film, nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****

before seeing this film, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. i didn't enjoy that film very much, but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashion.the actors don't shine, the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases. the only character of real interest for me was anthony quayle's intelligent jaggers.the so called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is a great one. it's a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don't care what other people say, you are what you are, if others can't take it, **** 'em. pip was told this early on, but he didn't listen.the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story, not in that same horrible level, but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her. pip's childhood didn't appear much better. the ending didn't seem to fit the rest of the story's style. the sets looked cheap, and coming to imdb i'm not surprised to see that this was indeed a tv-movie (which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library).live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. that's why the reviews are here. so you wouldn't have to waste your time on this sort of movies.3/10

no,i'm not a radical feminst bashing the hentai and yaoi genre,i just find it really boring and pointless.my god,i was made to watch this for initiation from some stupid punk and my my,even an mst3k movie has a storyline,not to mention that this hentai crap is what's giving anime a bad name world-wide (watch out sailor moon!).sadly,people don't realize that not all anime(or any other asian style) is sleazy porn.death to the stereotype!!!*starts casting ultima*

oh, i'm mostly not the kind of person to give a movie less than 5 points. mostly, just because of the effort from actors and directors.3/10 for keyman from me. if anyone thinks the main character (or whoever) deserves an oscar, i deserve the nobelprize for peace.seriously. i can't believe this movie made it to europe. the acting was horrible, the plot was awful and what about the '70's horror-music. give me a break."popeye" eg. what about him? why is he there, he has nothing to do with the movie.and what about the keyman's talking. one time he can't say a decent word, the next time he's getting all talky-talk. he also nearly dies when he wakes up and some sunlight shines thru his bunker. but when he's walking down the street, the sunlight doesn't seem to do anything.watch this movie only of you're on the edge of dying of boredom. i regret myself for not watching my roses grow, which are in anyway more entertaining than this piece of...

slow, odd film that drags and plods (i mean really plods) along to its disappointing climax. you may expect some sort of punchline at the end, but there is none. both milland and snodgress give awkward performances; in fact, the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it. the generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving....a gorilla. (**)

the attic starts off well. the somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there's a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when carrie snodgress' character buys a monkey. not one of those cute little monkeys. she buys a real big chimpanzee!!!this sudden plot device basically kills the movie. it's just not conceivable for a woman like the one snodgress plays, who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father, for her to, out of the blue, buy a chimpanzee. i mean, come on! forget about it!

linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, chuck traynor. i don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. we call ourselves "civilized" however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.

what can you say about a grainy, poorly filmed 16mm stag film, where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd? nothing that would be positive. avoid this travesty at all costs. in any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa. i strongly suggest imdb to re-visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings, since an 8.8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! i am, by no means, a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's & 80's; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the (then illegal) stag loop.

antonio margheriti, director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror cannibal apocalypse, helms this gothic-flavoured giallo starring gap-toothed 70s icon jane birkin (as well as her massive-conked french lover of the day, serge gainsbourg).unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty bi-sexual french teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan, seven deaths in the cat's eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure.pretty schoolgirl corringa (birkin) returns to her family's scottish estate after many years away, only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one. using the whole array of 'spooky old house' tricks (hidden doorways, dark corridors, creepy graveyards, candlelit cobweb covered rooms), margheriti cobbles together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings-on, but ends up with a lame cop-out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme.'and where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this?', i hear you ask. well, a rather pudgy moggy witnesses each murder thus justifying margheriti's rather cool sounding title.'gory, stylish fun' claims the dvd cover; 'boring pile of dung' says i.

not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target demographic, so i guess they hit the spot. pretty dull for an adult though.hard to relate to animated lego characters, even mod high-tech ones.i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity, duty, and destiny. am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic? especially destiny. what about freedom, equality, justice, etc.?oh well, it will sell lego. kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement. could have been a lot worse.

i saw grande ecole at its world premiere on the rotterdam film festival. i had no idea what i was entering and if i'd had any idea i wouldn't have entered. this is the most pretentious film i've seen for a long time. it tries to be provocative, yet deep, with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes - it doesn't succeed! it's nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen. 4/10

i saw this film at the new festival in new york. it was by far the worst film there. it's use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a wishy-washy script and direction that neither commits to a re-make of 'maurice' nor decides it's a neil labute flick, left me feeling 'why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this?'. it lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment, which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isn't. i wish the director and editor had re-edited the film because maybe there's more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.

this film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake. it was not an "art" movie; just an excuse to show several gratuitous, exploitative, over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity. there was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men. the camera zooms in on the men's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view. there are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis. it gets redundant real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously. i was wondering if i was watching a playgirl video by mistake. if these same scenes were filmed using women (ex: totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly) it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy...which is all that this film is. any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality. the themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing-desire, etc. were simple and superficial; no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student. just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead.

"grande ecole" is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but, if you're in need of it, a movie for an x-rated channel. although i suspect there's nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer, the plot is simply an excuse for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. there's likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth, plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa. all that's missing is a female-to-female coupling, which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot.the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie -- but "grande ecole" is, to be blunt about it, no more than pornography with artistic aspirations. i'm not offended by the sex. it's just repetitive and, before long, boring. where's the hays office when you really need it?

this is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater. look at the end of the picture, totally theatrical.with a reminiscent of les liaisons dangereuses the final steam-less speech try to make us think that the whole (and deep) theme of this matter was the manhood. who cares by this point? it was about manipulation. and so the audience feels after this movie has ended.young directors: a play is told with the words more than actions. a film is the opposite most of the times.and i'm not talking about the gay theme, overly exploited without a point ('cause there's no explanation of this topic considering the so called "philosophic" or presumptuous basis) to the level that this film should have been called grand gay

i saw this at a drive-in when i was 9. all i remember are a few scenes (the ones where the main character elle is being chased by a guy in a mask) and being scared spitless. seeing it now, my opinions have changed. it's a pathetic "horror" film about an ophanage run by gloria grahame (sad) and dealing with a young, talentless girl elle who is sent there after her mother, the town tramp, was beaten to death with a hammer (graphically shown). the film has adolescents (actually actors in their 20s) being beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked with meat cleavers, raped etc etc. the brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse. there is nothing to recommend about this crap. the plot is stupid, all the dialogue is bad and the acting...the less said the better. how did this sickie get by with a gp (now pg) rating? it would get an r now. worthless. one last thing...a truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest!

... a recommendation! gloria grahame runs the kind of orphanage where discipline is imparted with a meat cleaver, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and the bodies are kept in the deep freeze so that they can be brought out for when social services call. that the orphanage is strapped for cash we know because gloria puts all the orphans to work, and also because there don't seem to be enough clothes to go round - especially for the older nubile female orphans (age range appears to be 12 - 30 ish). the new arrival, however, turns out to be more than a match for gloria - and has indeed just taken out her own mother & mother's lover (in a witty claw hammer and arson opening scene). predictably, gloria ends up on a meat hook herself. this one was made for about tuppence but was/is a huge huge huge hit on the grindhouse circuit. my dvd cover promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes", and it sure wasn't lying. i believe it is regarded as the citizen kane of orphanage set torture porn movies. 4/10

when the opening shot is u.s. marines seriously disrespecting the u.s. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. there is a military adviser credited, who is also apparently a retired u.s. marine, making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol, and law, went unnoticed. even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. the u.s. government is still finding the missing from wwii, and it takes months to identify the remains. military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of red tape. here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. maybe this happens in denmark, but not in the u.s. clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with, or respect for, the u.s. military.beyond that, there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from cliffs notes. there's no way to know if the script was this awful originally, or if it was the auteur, or the middle-management kids at the studio who bear responsibility. either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made.

again, we're getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films. the good and the bad son story, courtesy east of eden. the american marine hero story, who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows. and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story.the mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn't so much of a problem though. because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around. no luck this time though, as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same.as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father, so that conflict is never resolved properly. apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife. now, how satisfying is that.next, the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved. because he never really talks to the man under suspicion, namely his own brother. so once more we're handed a loose end here.and finally, the american military heroism hypocrisy theme, where the marine is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirtiness of war he went through, he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards, that third theme falls flat just the same. because the movie ends right when, for the first time, he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through. where the real story would actually begin at that very point, namely his process of recovery, how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to. all that, all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored.so while story wise this film is a serious, and i mean serious, disappointment, i'd still give it points for the impressive cast. although no film should use maguire for a voice over, because that belongs to spiderman. especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. so much that i'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile.so while the cast really seems to do what they can, i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. a shallow and ultimately pretentious, utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed. message du jour to the writers: we know the wounds already, see the host of vietnam films. you want to earn some credit, show us a believable healing.

maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan o'brien and late night's fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching carson's show. carson daly can't hold a candle to leno, letterman, o'brien or any other late night talk show host, and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre. the shows only redeeming quality is that it's so short. but, i wouldn't call it crap. carson daly is sincere and doesn't hide the fact that his show isn't great(that honesty is actually helpful here), while some of last call's skits and material seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. actually, some of carson's montages have been quite entertaining, and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy.as an interviewer, carson is okay, even with only one guest, not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school av team. however, he doesn't have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious. i do not like his musical guests, but that's more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so, i'm not holding it against him.on to the house band. i don't know joe firstmans band and wouldn't compare them to the cbs orchestra, the tonite show band with kevin eubanks or the max weinberg 7. even cleeto and the cleetones are better. but, firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion. especially the alto sax player that sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register), if anything, watch the show for him, i do.in summary, this show isn't even worth a full bag of kibble n' bits. but it does have an audience, and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". if you don't have cable and are up at 1:37 am, there really isn't much more to choose from and, surprise surprise, there is worse out there in that time frame. so, if you're waiting for poker after dark to come on, 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait.

for a while when i was in-between jobs i had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows. for a while i had a good selection: conan, leno, letterman, ferguson, kimmel...until i reached the 1:30 a.m. time slot. the time between conan and x- files, on scifi. and the only show on at that time was (and curiously still is) carson daly.his show intrigued me at first. youngish, casually dressed, and with the hip pedigree of an mtv host, i thought carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. i couldn't have been more wrong.he has no comedic timing. his jokes are plainly unfunny, and his monologue a painful affair of self-conscious babbling. i began to think he simply wasn't capable of delivering comedy (and i am right, he isn't), but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him. the writing was idiotic and much too overreaching and the skits screamingly bad. and towards the end of the show being in-studio, the writers had carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show, an oblivious carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed his way through interviews.zero interview skills. none. he tries to be friendly/chatty, but ends up being boorish and rude. he talks too much. he cuts off his guests. he asks them rude or embarrassing questions -- if he can find a question to ask them at all. and as someone had already pointed out, the guests literally stare at him or squirm in their seats, clearly uncomfortable.now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy cam. even still, carson refuses to take the hint from nbc. at one point, carson didn't even get a camera man, he had to film himself for an episode! wake up, carson...that handwriting is all over the wall.i see the show is produced by carson. i can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air, he pays for it himself.

he seems to be a control freak. i have heard him comment on "losing control of the show" and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule-"no snakes." he needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. the only reason i watch him is because he some some great guests and bands. i watched the craig ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse. he likes to bull sh** to burn time.i don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows.daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips. he must do this at least 10 times a show. i do like the joe firstman band. carson daily needs to lighten up before it is too late.

before last call w/ carson daly, my local nbc affiliate aired much more worthwhile programming after late night w/ conan such as second city tv, 3rd rock from the sun & carline in the city reruns, and some stand up comedy. these days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all i get to see is carson daly and his awful show. he is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he isn't a good speaker nor comedian.on his june 21st show, he tried to use an internet meme called the "rickroll" on his show. he failed hard. that event confirms that carson daly is awful.

nothing carson daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh, or even smile a little. i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years.even the "funny" band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him. daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys. it seems like they don't even try to be a little funny.awful awful awful show.it makes my soul cry.i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is. don't watch it. but if you absolutely have to, i recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand.

carson daly has to be the only late night talk show host that isn't a comedian. what was nbc thinking! he's not funny! the writing is horrible to! all of the sketches are painful to watch. the current new karaoke isn't funny at all, especially since he tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it! the escalator interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all. all he jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least clever, dumbest, not funny jokes ever put on television! i mean, anytime he makes a jessica simpson joke he ends it with "because she's stupid," which cancels out any funniness that was in the joke, which was already very low. any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show. seriously, don't watch this show, unless you're on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge.

i don't think i've ever gave something a 1/10 rating, but this one easily gets the denomination. i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes. it's not just that the jokes are so bad, but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma, can't set up or finish a punchline, and you've got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach.i have watched the show, never in its entirety, but many times still. it just creeps up on me after conan. i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever.actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest, it's just that, an interview. i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that's screaming, "get me the hell away from this freak!" i do recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but to ponder, how he got on the air and what he's still doing there. watch as much as you can, i think you will find its complete awkwardness...interesting.

it's not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film. this was, however, simply the worst movie i have ever seen. the performances were laughable at best, at worst they were, well, there's no other word for it, awful. especially the lead female who's random sexual come-ons have to be seen and heard to be believed. honestly, the plot is nonsensical,the dialogue appalling and the characterisation...there is none. i'm surprised it's not an alan smithee film. i can't stress this strongly enough... avoid at all costs.how do movies like this ever get made? this is no budget film-making at its very, very worst.

jon good's wife (simply one of the worst titles for a film ever), or the red right hand (another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing & has no relevance to the film) under which i saw it, is set in 'salem, massachusettes 1978' (incidently the year i was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those 365 days) where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion, gay-boy fagot roger mather (john kuntz, is that surname for real? just say it out loud...), martha alden (kim brockington), rebecca lawson (jenna stern) & her boyfriend jake stabler (john doe), alan hobbes (michael kevin walker) & his wife sandy (megan rawa) plus john good (marc ardito, why is the spelling of 'john' different in the title?) & his wife sara (abigail morgan). from the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air & when someone mentions their 'missing' friend calef (jason winther) lots of unpleasant memories come flooding back. then comes the phone calls, the mysterious nose-bleeds, hallucinations & guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to light...produced, executive produced & directed by kurt gioscia who also wrote the thing & kurt st. thomas who gets the art direction credit too & if that wasn't enough they both act in the film as well! personally i thought jon good's wife was awful, i mean she can't cook or anything! ha ha ha, only joking! seriously though i didn't think much of the film overall, for a start it's pretty slow going & the entire first 30 minutes is solid snooze material of the reunion consisting of lots of catching up with each other & dull character building exposition. the film never explains itself, what's with those weird nose-bleeds for god's sake, the mysterious phone calls, the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural & what the hell was sara all about? she comes across as some nosey, sex crazed, dirty talking, shameless, bitter blackmailing know-it-all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets! some of the dialogue she spouts wouldn't be out of place in a porno & it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horror/thriller it was supposedly meant to be. then there's the ending, if there's a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever i have yet to see it. the whole thing was very predictable as well, i mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend calef went 'missing' there wouldn't be more to it?directors gioscia & thomas make an infuriating film, on top of the predictability & annoying climax there is a retrospective narration by alan which i simply don't understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else & at what point in time is he narrating from? the reasons behind this narration is never made clear or elaborated upon. there's no tension because the whole things so by-the-numbers.technically the film is ok but nothing special & some of the locations & clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me, this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70's. the acting was alright & what about actor john kuntz last name? i suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of kuntz, right?!i really didn't think much of jon good's wife (a blow up doll would have been better! ha ha ha) & i'm not sure who it would appeal to. forget about any gore, horror, violence, scares, atmosphere or excitement, in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it ain't here. not recommended.

i'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store, wondering if i should give it a shot. today i broke down and gave it a whirl, and i probably shouldn't have.while the writer/director did give the film a respectable effort, it fell far short of engaging. the characters, while you wanted to feel for them, just didn't have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them. sara's sexual outbursts got tiring-- fast. i don't mind sex in films, and i don't mind bitchy characters, but being a "bad" girl doesn't mean you're prone to excitedly ask people at random if they'd like sexual favors. by the time what happened to the characters was revealed, i was bored, and ready to fast-forward to the climax, the end, anything exciting... and nothing delivered. the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic, and just wasn't played quite right. if they'd have thrown a bit more anguish in there, i might have been interested. this should have been a more of a suspense/drama film, and should have stuck to the title "jon good's wife" rather than the whole "red right hand" and horror film-like cover. hell... this should have had suspense, period.either way... watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on the television. though this isn't as great as i'd hoped, i would go for this over some infomercials.

clearly, andreas bethmann would like to wear jess franco's crown whilst coveting (at least cinematically) the old workhorse's wife, lina romay. romay plays a corrupt, salacious, masturbating prison warden in this modern, ambitious w.i.p. film. with some exceptions, many of franco's films are ineptly produced and directed in a slipshod, hurried manner. shots don't always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrific. while watching "angel of death 2" (aka "prison island massacre") i asked myself if bethmann is deliberately trying to replicate franco's patent shoddiness, or is he just naturally shoddy like his mentor? is this movie deliberately bad, which would be self-defeating, or is it simply bad by neglect? after a hitchhiker is forced to give a gunpoint blowjob, her rapist fills her mouth, then fills her vagina with some drugs. minutes later, she is hauled into a clifftop prison for reasons not explained and subjected to the leers and rough handling of staff and other inmates. as this is a wip film, there are lesbian scenes galore and plenty of violent behavior. the gore is bloody and sadistic, too, with delights such as teeth pulling and scalping (courtesy of olaf ittenbach). the acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame, but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy. unfortunately, the flat script makes for a flat movie. so, despite numerous atrocities, hardcore sex, and a guest appearance from jess franco, the experience is an empty one. but isn't that what most jess franco movies are?

i watched this movie on tv last night, hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease. i was disappointed, and i think the movie was garbage. it did not seem real to me. some of the acting was awful, in particular that of the doctor. she was about the worst i've seen. the whole thing played like a cnn 'worst case scenario'. even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn't seem sincere. i have seen some disaster movies, in particular those weather ones, which are actually so bad they are amusing. this one is almost as bad, but it is not even amusing, it is tedious and boring.don't bother with this one.

fatal contact: bird flu in america: 3 out of 10: this movie is both funny and sad. the funny part is fairly obvious as this certainly isn't a sober look at a possible impending crisis. this is a modern version of the swarm. and much like those killer bees (and the so called killer bee crisis that prompted them) bird flu has joined a pantheon of media inspired end of the world scenarios (sars, y2k, global warming) that simply refuse to actually come about.the sad part is the blatant attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic. disease pandemics historically were fairly common after all people didn't all die in their forties from heart disease. even recent pandemics such as aids mirrors the old fashioned vd crisis (think syphilis) that used to kill more soldiers than bullets.the flu pandemic of the early twenties was a nasty business killing millions but honestly life went on. i wonder if our over dramatic media and their power hungry government allies would allow life as normal today.the movie itself swerves wildly from fairly competent scenes (triage in grand central station) to the ridiculous (rednecks try to ambush national guardsman in manhattan).the scenarios themselves are fairly useless as the filmmakers can't seem to decide exactly how contagious the bird flu is or for that matter whether the symptoms are an ebola style crash or simply a long illness. indeed one scene will show everyone in bio-hazard suits and the next will have nobody even wearing a mask.the film also patently refuses to actually give any practical advice regarding what to do in a bird flu crisis. (outside of wash your hands, what no duct tape?) the acting and directing are competent for a tv movie but the script is all over the map. last the movie has a strangely non-exponential death total running on the bottom of the screen. just like the swarm did.

the c class cast and poorly transitioned scenes, complete with terrible acting have led me too believe this would make a good tv only release such as the fx presentation of a smallpox outbreak. at my local blockbuster however, about 9 copies are held on the shelves, none of which were checked out when i rented the title (i wonder why....) anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the "fear factor" the director was going for. the whole "death count" on the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot at times, such as when the chopper was going over angola, and the toll was speeding at a breakneck pace from 23 million to 24. however, as the movie ends, (possibly several hours or even a day or so after the chopper has landed) the death toll counter is reset back too what it was at the moment the chopper was approaching the area. the movies end left a huge whole in th entire plot, and god knows nobody is waiting for the sequel. anyway, do not rent this, i only advise watching this if you have obtained the title with no monetary loss, and you are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie.

what garbage, is there actually no part ii? if this movie actually ends the way it did, everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed. this movie is nothing close to a movie like outbreak, which was actually a fairly decent movie. this movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars. i started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad, but i never imagined it would be this bad. this movie was nothing more then a way to exploit the fears of the american people for profit! if you have not seen this movie, don't bother. movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting. i really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks. stay away! don't be fooled by the hype!

after spending half an hour examining rumors, a gay bar located outside tupelo, mississippi, small town gay bar shifts focus to the murder of scotty weaver in bay minette in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects. but there is a problem here. bay minette isn't near tupelo, as the film implies. it isn't even in the same state. it is actually about three hundred miles away in coastal alabama.director malcom ingram doesn't exactly rush to point out this fact, nor does he bother to mention that while bay minette itself is little more than a wide spot in the road, it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of mobile, alabama--which has a noticeable gay community, quite a few gay bars, and even a congregation of metropolitan community church. if ingram is disingenuous on these points, one has to ask if he is on others as well.speaking as someone who was born, raised, and continues to live in mississippi, i have to say that i find most of small town gay bar a lot of hooey. neither meridian nor tupelo, the communities upon which ingram focuses, are as rural, small, or as isolated as he would have you imagine, and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies. that said, ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community, and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture, which tends to hold those who frequent bars--be they gay or straight--in low esteem.small town gay bar is, in my opinion, an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda. do gays and lesbians living in rural mississippi face major, sometimes frightening challenges? you bet they do--but that's no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree. the dvd includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes, but i found the feature film itself so ridiculous that i didn't waste any time on them.gft, amazon reviewer

maybe it's unfair to dislike a movie for what it isn't, rather than what it is, but i approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about small-town rural gay men and women. instead, the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry (big news!) of the locals (and those in outlying areas) and the really gruesome torture/murder of a young gay man.so much time devoted to stupid people squawking about aids, sin, hellfire, and perverts. so much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the bible and gay people getting what they deserve.i wanted to see more of the people that came to the "small town gay bar", not those who opposed it. in addition, the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town.the whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration, and it's very suspect.

sure, it's hard being gay, especially in the south. we get it. over... and over again.what stood out was that the film makers focused almost wholly on the more "extreme" characters in these small town gay bars; the drag queens, the seedy sleaze of a bar long-closed, and on a guy who was brutally murdered for being gay, yet had nothing to do with either of the bars which were the focus of this film.there were snippets of interviews from other people, people viewers would, perhaps, be better able to relate to. but they were glossed over, practically skipped, maybe shown in a glimpse in the background.it would have been more interesting, to me at least, to hear the experiences of the more common gay men and women who were either enriched or otherwise by the experiences of a small town gay bar and/or the absence of that community.

i was ready for a crouching tiger style movie and all i got was the worst movie i've seen in years. it was almost as bad as baron von munchhuasen. dead script. dead acting. dead everything. granted there was some good fight scenes but the positive side ends there. if this movie arrives in your house run screming to a phone and dial 911 and say, "please help there is a movie in my house meant to force people to commit suicide"

this film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to the everglades along with another couple and the family dog. when they first get there, they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week. after pestering with the old man, three hillbillys also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. after asking some of the local dummies that can't speak or just don't want to answer, they finaly find the cabin. after they settle in, strange things happen to the visitors including discovering crap on their car, the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end. adding a church group did not make the story any better. then at the end, the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun. lame. thats what this movie is.

i have never watched a movie that frustrated me more than lord of the dance. frustrated because it could have been fantastic. frustrated because the dancing might have been astounding. frustrated because the women could have been gorgeous. how would i know though?! by the time your eyes have moved to the area of interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired the insane editor has moved the shot! i completely agree with the other comments here about the crappy lighting and terrible camera/editor work. it makes me nauseous just watching ten minutes of this would be spectacular movie.give me an opportunity to get a front seat to the live concert and i would be there in a shot! nicholas t

i can't really remember any details of this movie except that the setting looked awfully familiar. then i realized it was filmed at the lazy lizard hostel in moab, utah. that was one of my favorite places to visit when i was younger and wandered around the country. the guy who owns/manages the hostel managed to get himself in the movie. all i remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women. it is great to watch just for the scenery (i mean the rock formations)... if you are just looking for soft-core porn, you will probably be better served elsewhere. i don't even know if this movie is available on tape or dvd.

ken harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a road accident. end of story."end of story", that is, in the sense of "end of any physical action". not in the sense of "end of the film". ken's life is saved, but he is paralysed from the neck down. when he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive. the rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die.ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, michael emerson. although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, here it is presented in purely secular ones. if dr emerson has any deep religious convictions, these are never expressed in the film. he believes passionately, however, that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight; to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty. ken therefore finds himself in a "catch-22" situation. he must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. emerson, however, considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality. ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital.richard dreyfuss as ken and john cassavetes as dr emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity, but this cannot hide the fact that "whose life is it anyway?" simply does not work as a film. at one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. when plays were filmed, therefore, the general tendency was to "open them up" by filming on location as well as on studio sets, by taking liberties with the playwright's text, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters.i have never seen brian clarke's play, but i suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema. there is very little physical action; most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed. such a plot does not lend itself to the "opening up" device at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by talk at the expense of action. although it is well written and there is some good acting, i am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject. 4/10

this is just art house rubbish. i sat watching this trash with my bosnian friends they found it as boring as i did. for a more interesting and more true account watch the excellent movie saviour. this is just a snoozefest with people talking in coffee shops.a cure for insomnia. 1 out of 10

this has to be one of the most awfully scripted films i've ever seen. it's basically a remake of the beast from 20,000 fathoms (1953), but done with your standard snake-like puppet-monster instead of a sleek ray harryhausen creation. combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of the creeping terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like.the movie is dubbed, although by the original actors (i think that the movie was originally dubbed in italian for that countries audiences, then redubbed for us release), which just makes the movie seem weird...the sounds, like in a japanese monster movie, just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving properly.poor ray milland...he's certainly come a long way down from the lost weekend or dial m for murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in. add this to his other sci-fi travesties (panic in the year zero, x the man with x-ray eyes) and you can see a once good actor fallen into a boris karloff syndrome...stuck doing really bad horror films in foreign countries just for the work.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. a movie that is about a stupid looking monster from the ocean that threatens a small town which has to be filled with the dumbest people on earth.spoilers if you even carethey can't even kill the damn thing by the end of the movie. the movie ends and they're like, "well, some day we'll have to kill it."avoid at all costs.

and abysmal, over-the-top acting, you might enjoy this rubbish flick.apparently atomic bombs makes life mutate in about a day or two (or according to other viewers, wake them up). or so it seems. and apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of spain doesn't make anyone ask any questions at all. coming to think of it, the plot doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever (why would evil sock puppets attack lighthouses?), so the nukes going off for no reason at all doesn't stand out too much.ok, getting past this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing you make of socks in kindergarten, you may actually be able to stand this. but for once the complete lack of gore doesn't help, leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rock-bottom-budget "glory".i doubt you'll be able to watch this though, so better stay well away.

this film has me seriously doubting again whether armando de ossorio was a good filmmaker or not... his blind dead films are praised by many fans. this i can understand. but wanna-be gothic vampire trite like malenka doesn't show any signs from a gifted filmmaker. and that also goes for serpiente de mar. it features horrible acting, a dumb plot, stupid events, a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monster-movie and also veteran actor ray milland, who does his best to mumble his way through this film while not having much of a clue about what he's doing in it. apparently milland was already very ill while shooting serpiente de mar (his last theatrical feature) and going out with a ridiculous stinker like this, makes it all the more sad. one last appearance alongside peter cushing in a made-for-tv film directed by roy ward baker (also in 1984) doesn't change much about it.but the sock puppet/sea serpent is a hoot to behold. watch it swirl up a lighthouse and crush it. see it destroy a harbour with miniature boats. look at it demolish bridges and munch on charming miniature trains.good badness? yes. 3/10 and 7/10

amando deossorio was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories. his "blind dead" series started off great but had some truly laughable moments, such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for "the ghost galleon". in "the sea serpent", he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings google-eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariums.a vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where american pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of spain. the military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent american flag and a portrait of a deranged-looking ronald reagan, one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the eighties. the other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that declares the year to be "1.985" and tyria power's dated sheena easton hairdo, which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats.one of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. we learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish. unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the sea serpent, which swiftly descends on the coast of spain for some miniature-set mayhem.now when i say the monster is unrealistic, i am not exaggerating. it's not just "sort of" fake looking. i'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been allotted, but most of the time it looks like it was made out of crayola markers, a ping pong ball, and an old sock. not only that, it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes, music that sounds so much like the "jaws" theme that it's a wonder nobody got sued.along with tyria power, timothy bottoms and ray milland are caught slumming, and the dialogue could not have been any more dismal. through a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to...well, i'm not sure what the purpose is. bottoms and power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a serpent-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). none of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. nobody admits the serpent is real, and it's not even dead. furthermore, power and bottoms are still on the lam from the law. as illogical as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. the critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. but never mind. it swims away, and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. the end.i can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on. a lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced-in sock puppet/stop motion beastie. at least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head. i'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; the monster is cheap, but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets, so somebody did spend some time making those, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved. it's seemingly played straight, although maybe this film's sense of humor went over my head. in the end, the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken commentary. watch it at a party for best results.

i absolutely positively can't believe my fellow imdb reviewers. all the praise about how "original" this movie is, it's like they've never seen "ring" or the million of imitations that's come out in the 10 years since that movie. and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs! i think not! "shutter" is okay. average, i'd say. i give it 5 out of 10, but there's just no way it's original and great and "the most frightening thing i've ever seen" as one reviewer said. puh-leeeze, people. this one is plain. it's predictable.i swear, if i see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why she's so mad and after them, i'm going to scream."original"? give me a break. you people need to get out more. or at least stop calling yourselves "horror movie fans".

i picked out this dvd out of the cheepo bin at walmart because the cover showed one of the planes i flew during viet-nam (c-123k). i did not fly for air america, but knew being a c-123 pilot, i knew a lot who did, including those who flew in my reserve unit back home. i am not a movie critic, but wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make movies like this. the best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman. the flying shots and stunts (although totally cartoon like) are excellent. the movie begins with hollywood's favorite fall guy in 1969. but the fact is, nixon did not start air america, he did not begin the lies. johnson was responsible for air america and nixon inherited the lies, the war, and air america. its not fair or accurate to portray nixon as a liar on the subject of air america. all president's have inherited the lies of their predecessors. nobody smart enough to fly a c-123 was dumb enough to not know what they were joining. that makes the downey character unbelievable. a c-123 was a rugged airplane. it could easily fly on one engine, or the two auxiliary jet engines. the three stooges shooting a duck with one shot is more likely. pilots who flew with air america were civilian employees of the cia, they were not reckless soldiers of fortune. they had a good reason to behave and believe in a future, if they survived their extremely dangerous job. they were given double time towards a retirement pension. they weren't required to sell dope or guns to get a good pension. dope was legal and a way of life in sea, as it still is today in afganistan. if individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it was not cia policy. the cia was fighting a war on communism, not drugs. the writer based his story on "war stories". pilots love to bs anybody who will buy them a beer and listen. the writer and director who had an ax to grind about viet-nam and nixon. see the movie, and remember how it starts - it blames nixon for what existed for years. remember, he didn't become president until jan 20, 1969.my favorite scene is the landing up hill in the jungle. air america pilots put planes in places the aircraft designers never thought possible. their were plenty of funny stories that could have been shown. instead, the director chose to use the oversize rubber scene to show how dumb the cia was. this scene shows that the director and writer fell for some pilot bar talk and the joke is on them. mds fort valley virginia.

i normally wouldn't waste my time criticizing a useless movie such as this. however, i'm off of work this week, so i have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless trivialities. to start, let me say that i frequently enjoy non-commercial, non-mainstream, non-american cinema. (feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography.) that said, there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the u.s. trust me, i've been tortured by hundreds of them. "lost in beijing" is one particularly bad film.the opening half hour is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneracy. this film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as kim ki-duk's "bad guy" (2001). 1. women actually enjoy being raped; 2. rape should be glorified, praised, and respected; 3. feel free to rape any woman you like, because while your "doing" her she'll eventually start to like it and reach orgasm; 4. if you're wife gets raped, make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money, but if he doesn't pay, just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as compensation; 5. if you're wife gets raped, be sure to screw and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist, taunting her with lines like, "did he fu*k you like this?"; 6. if you're husband is a rapist, just accept it; 7. after you personally get raped, befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible.how can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters? they're nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways, but actually revel in their meaninglessness and support each other. don't misunderstand me though. i'm very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to my own. "ichi the killer" (2001) and "moonlight whispers" (1999) are very interesting portrayals of sado-masochism. "strange circus" (2005) is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse. "marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage. even religiously-based movies like "running on karma" (2003) and "samsara" (2001) have entertained me on occasion. the difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them, whereas "lost in beijing" has virtually none.it's known that people with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet, but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior. why, exactly, does bing bing eventually befriend and care for her rapist? why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior unconditionally? the filmmakers never bothered to tell us. even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and in the end served as a mere situational ploy. it all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour subsides. other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization. the reason you can't choose which person to root for is because they weren't developed properly. don't think that this movie has complex characters just because they're not clearly defined. on the contrary, the reason they're not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they're thinking. this is hardly a positive attribute of this movie. on the positive side, the camera-work and acting are quite good, but everything else just gets duller and duller as the film progresses. you can place this alongside trash like "turning gate" (2002), "what time is it there" (2001), "irreversible" (2002), and the aforementioned "bad guy."

i do not generally appreciate light-weight attempts at creating humourous stories, which means that "anita no perd el tren" cannot score very high for me. the story is good: a middle-aged but still good-looking woman finds a new love. but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical. rosa maría sardà has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as "amic/amat" (qv), "todo sobre mi madre" (qv), "las amargas lágrimas de petra von kant" (qv) and "el embrujo de shanghai" (qv). however the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff, for the cinema and for tv. something similar could be said of josé coronado: perfectly able to produce serious performances. maría barranco belongs safely in this grouping.such that, in the end, i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film, in a serious tone, which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills. and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors. wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed.

an obscure horror show filmed in the everglades. two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the unfriendliness of the locals. who, or what, are the blood stalkers? after awhile they find out. watch for the character of the village idiot who clucks like a chicken, he certainly is weird.

ok, so my summary line is a cheap trick. but the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised, so...i caught this one on tv (uncut, as tv here shows all movies, that's for you americans who might say i didn't like it because i saw a cut tv version - fortunately that's only an us thing), and had no idea about what it was. i switched on, caught the last minutes of a show, and the movie began. within a minute, i was begging it was a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning (yes, it's a bad movie-within-the-movie, i know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! i don't even know why i didn't switch channels). and, yes, in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy, albeit an unintentional one.marina zudina is pretty enough, but gosh, what a dreadful performance! while casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough (she doesn't talk so bye bye language barrier), yet, sorry, marina baby, playing mute doesn't mean impersonating harpo marx. her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments, just look at her when she draws an x in the air while stalked by the killer. he wants to kill you, it's no time to play zorro. we get plenty of "running upstairs" stuff passing for tension, as in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other. ugh! will hollywood ever learn? yet the best/worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and... well, i have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub, but i'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in real life, do you? and how about immediately trusting a mean-looking guy because he says he's a cop, and not asking him to show you his credentials? ok, so he turns out to be a real cop. but still, not asking for the badge makes no sense (plot-wise, we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop. screen writing 101). and how about the big twist? don't tell me you didn't see that coming from 200 miles away...i feel sorry for poor old alec guinness and his useless stock footage cameo. now i think about this, what's the point in giving him a "mystery guest star" credit... in the end titles? the movie's over, there's no mystery anymore, and everybody and their brother have identified guinness (even non-movie buffs will recognize "the old guy from 'star wars'"). yet better off this way, so we can pretend it's not the late great actor.people keep comparing this to, of all people, hitchcock. i suppose it has to be john hitchcock the milkman, as the late sir alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this, let alone making it. and this gets a 6.8/10???? it's bottom 100 material! but then, we're talking a rating system that allows 'the lord of the rings: the return of the king' to appear as the third best movie ever made (check top 100), so...2/10.

i haven't had a chance to view the previous film, but from what i've read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one, although i doubt that is possible. i'm a huge fan of the "zombie" genre, and i am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures, that for all intents and purposes are human, as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head. that said, hotd 2 takes the "zombie" movie to an all new low.without giving any big spoilers (which i really should do just so you won't bother wasting your time actually watching this movie) i would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries special forces. gomer pile could have probably survived longer than the "spec ops" soldiers in this film. for crying out loud they should have called them the special education forces instead. if you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies, at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses. i understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement.the writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high-tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for, and the idea has merit, if it wasn't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making. i mean come on, zombie films aren't exactly "high art", and the viewer expects some tongue-in-cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills, but hotd 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters. if you are a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.

its almost embarrassing to say i even saw this movie. i mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. does house of the dead 2 do any of these things right? no, not one. of course, its not as bad as its predecessor, from uwe bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.the dialog in this movie is notorious, with such lines as "what do you do for a living?" in response "i kill zombies" and "i was never a disk jockey, i was a soldier." the special effects are embarrassing even for a made for tv movie, i mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. the army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room. this movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms. in fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school.also, why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models? and for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them. heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie.overall, this movie makes even the worst of scifi channel movies looks fantastic.

this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all time.it is worth the rental for a some wildly great laugh's.the story is absolutely ludicrous.nothing in life would happen like this.it's so completely unbelievable. the way james woods tries and hustle heavy hitters, than they give this supposed two-bit hustler a job 3000 miles away in la what a jokei love the old beat vw bug to signify how low they've gotten in life because of all the `tootski's'.sean young is as unbelievably bad as the, "i'll love you forever, no matter what, wife" you'll ever see.if it wasn't so funny you would throw up at how sugary sweet young tries to project herself.and as bad acting as you'll ever see.james wood overacts throughout the whole movie and he's so extremely funny and is way, way over the top, it's just not to be believed, woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night live.but watching woods on `ludes' is worth the price of the rental.i love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more `ludes' that he doesn't do that stuff anymore, right before that, woods just did three giant lines of coke.this is some very funny stuff.the ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie.

i saw this film in the theater when it first came out, i'm sorry to say, and it was one of only a few films i have ever wanted to walk out of early. i didn't have a problem with the drug content and i could see how this cautionary tale could have been powerful. the problem was, the film-maker, working with james woods and sean young, drew two of the least lovable characters i have ever seen on film. i hated this pair and couldn't have cared less if they sunk straight to the inevitable bottom. their was not one surprise in this film. every turn of events was so painfully obvious that i felt i could have written the script myself; although i like to think i would have done a better job. i subsequently heard nightmarish stories about the incidents on the set between sean young and james woods along the lines of some sort of stalking events. it made me wonder if the terrible acting arose out of some bad feelings and dysfunction. anyway, i refer to the boost as the worst film i've ever paid money to see.

my gosh, this movie was nothing more than filmmaking by numbers. struggling salesman can't make a go of it in new york, mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, struggling salesman moves to california and makes it big, then loses it big, then bounces back with the simple life, then hits rock bottom trying to get back to the top. i don't think i can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. case in point (spoiler?): when the john kapelos character calls to say he and his girlfriend were coming to santa cruz to visit, and james woods says there's practically no chance he would come, you knew with 100% certainty they were coming in the next scene or two.on the other hand, sean young sure looked good.

salesman lenny brown (woods) is fast losing his knack of selling the proverbial ice cream to eskimos. given a chance to shine in california by a philanthropic entrepreneur, brown and his wife linda (young) live the high life off tax shelter investments; a fortune they lose when the federal government changes the tax laws.seven hundred thousand dollars in the red, and in need of a 'boost', the yuppies without portfolio begin to hoover vast quantities of colombian marching powder up their hooters, until they find themselves with rather hungry monkeys on their back. after briefly cleaning up, linda's coke-induced miscarriage sees lenny once more careering like a pinball between uppers and downers. living purgatory follows.a contemporary take on reefer madness, with perverse echoes of albert brooks' lost in america, the boost was overshadowed on release by tabloid revelations concerning an alleged affair between woods and young, and their tumultuous falling out. woods, then engaged to horse trainer sarah owen (now his ex-wife), reputedly slapped a $2 million lawsuit on his spurned co-star for "emotional harassment" during filming, citing fatal attraction-style late-night phone calls to his fiancée and, in one noteworthy incident, reputedly leaving a mutilated baby doll on his and owen's doorstep.ironically, the lack of chemistry between the supposedly loving leads is one of the more depressing aspects of this latter-day exploitation flick - the only real passion woods demonstrates towards young is when he's kicking her around the room. the script too is hilariously dreadful, perhaps mitigating young's near-comatose performance when given howlers like "stay with me - 'til i fall off the earth" to emote. further, given woods' edgy dramatic personae, his jittery descent loses all credibility when actually he looked that way to begin with.ultimately, the boost must be seen in context: in the 21st century cocaine use is ubiquitous. however, in 1988, with america still embroiled in an unwinnable "war on drugs", the very fibre of the nation looked to be in peril - hence one of the most hellish - and for that read hysterical - depictions of drug-abuse.

it is impossible to avoid comparing zhang yimou's `hero' to ang lee's `crouching tiger, hidden dragon.' they were both big-budget chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars. but aside from the obvious, there is in fact nothing else to compare. `hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters, proving that big-name stars, beautiful scenery, and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision.all the marketing hype preceding the premier of `hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one. much anticipated, `hero' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland china and hong kong, making it an instant box-office success. however, though the script pleased government censors, chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. on-line critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed the film `ideologically disturbing,' `from the viewpoint of deep servitude,' written `either by an amateur historian, or someone with ulterior motives.' one article was simply titled, `hero, you make me sick!'the deepest failing of the film is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring! all blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history, but `hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as stalin or hitler. `hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun. instead, it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being `deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy.though historians agree that the first emperor of china was ruthlessly violent, mao zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given mao's own tyrannical rule. likewise, the communist government in beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the first emperor and its own iron-fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by zhang yimou. tony leung, one of the stars of `hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations, because it was needed to maintain `stability' in china. for these remarks, tony leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of hong kong, but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie.director zhang yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. unfortunately, his version of `wisdom' turns out to be: the oppressor is right. in china, where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny. the great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world: one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice, free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills. only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in china, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, zhang yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth, as he had hoped, but downwards, to the level of government propaganda. it's no wonder the government was so pleased.some film lovers may secretly wonder, `all moralistic judgments aside, is it at least entertaining?' fortunately, the answer is a resounding `no!' because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations, it becomes tedious to watch. moreover, the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development, since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the `real' version emerges.the film is not without its beautiful images. however, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline. the use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived, and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful. great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film.for those in china who showed disdain for `crouching tiger's' unrealistic kung-fu, much was expected from `hero.' jet li, who plays the title role, is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor. his previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that zhang yimou could use li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities. but it was not to be. `hero' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and jet li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting: an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. as the casting director ought to have expected, li fails miserably. meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film, between li and and donnie yen. all the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so `hero' fails to satisfy, even on that level.though most audiences outside china are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel first emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept zhang's version of `chinese wisdom,' which is anything but. perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of `hero' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for chinese government officials.

impressive vision indeed, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic chinese violins too... let me think, "crouching tiger, hidden dragon"?i kinda liked cthd, with its down-to-earth simplicity and well developed characters, that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the deeepaa meaning of it."hero" on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. the larger-than-life moral was horrible. i mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed???? wtf??no, thanks.but, hay, mao and g.w.b. would be proud!viva

the message of hero is quite clear: the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. at a time when china is dangling its war toys over taiwan, it is unacceptable for western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. roger ebert of chicago tribune, david edelstein of slate, charles taylor of salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed hero. in so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. the only critic (that i know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was j. hoberman of the village voice, who wrote of the film's "sanctimonious traditionalism" and its "glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness." i, for one, sign my name under hoberman's final pronouncement: hero is nothing more than "fascinating fascism."

as a native chinese, i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. i said 'better world' because it is a lie that chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! i guess most western audience may don't know qin shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient china. the tianxia(chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. from then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.another fact is, qin shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.well, i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.

because they all just watch there mst3k with their artificial friends who make (mostly) not that funny and obvious comments about movies. and that's the only way these people watch them and then they comment and down-vote them on the imdb based just on that, they don't even try to watch the film on it's own.i watched this film on it's own, i didn't read the reviews first, i didn't have some people telling what to laugh at, i just got the dvd (bought for the flip side morons from outer space, an old fave) and watched it.of cause i knew kind of what i was in for when it's a golan globus, albert pyun film, but usually they can be quite entertaining.the film is a non too stressing on the brain alice down the rabbit-hole story done so many times, and kind of similar in basic structure (but completely different in content) to warlords of atlantis, another entertaining b-movie.the voice, was annoying, but then that's the idea, which they even poke at with a few lines in the movie.the hero character had one of the worst over-the top voices/accents in english language film history, but you grow to accept it and enjoy it.it's not a good film, but it's not a really bad film, it's just a bit of an average b-movie dtv kind of film, nothing too new nothing too outstanding, and probably would be enjoyed more by a younger age bracket (say 7-14 year olds) than i. it's a bit of light-hearted fantasy.will i see it again, probably not maybe about 10 years ago i would have.don't be so harsh on a movie because a couple of puppets told you too, this film isn't taking itself seriously and it's certainly no troll 2 or space mutiny.

every boy eventually learns the lesson that just because a girl is good-looking, it doesn't mean she's good. well, lemme tell you, at age 19, lesson learned. it's hard to tell what's worse: kathy ireland's acting skills, or her ultra-high-pitched voice; the one that sounds like a screeching mouse on helium scratching its tiny little claws down a blackboard. with an incomprehensible plot set in outer space with dwarves that want kathy ireland's bones for some obscure reason, this movie is just wrong on so many levels. if there were ever a candidate for a mystery science theater 3000 revival, this would be it.

...don't watch it. here's a hint: tune in to the last 5 minutes and you'll catch her in a bikini. otherwise you'll just have to sit through the flick and endure her helium-sucking voice view for screen time with the inexplicable aussie accents of the lost city of atlantis or wherever the heck she goes to to locate her missing father. we now know why kathy pursued a non-speaking career of modelling: she couldn't have survived the death-threats from those poor headache-suffering victims who heard her voice for more than 30 seconds. the rest of the story is some kind of weird poorly-lit mad max mish-mash.

i watched the mst3k version of the movie, and this review includes minor spoilers.when i started watching this movie, it looked like it might have promise as a cheesy sci-fi flick, but the more i watched it, the more disappointing it got. the first reason is pretty idiosyncratic - i liked the mousy shy girl with glasses a lot more than the model wanda became by the end of the movie. more deeply, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and change in clothing replaced any actual character growth. instead of growing into a character that could take care of herself, wanda was just as dependent on males to do everything for her as she was at the start of the movie. the acting could have been better (though i got tired of cracks about ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself! it's not that bad.) the background was okay, but it was a little hokey (aliens = humans with facepaint), and could have used more explanation.maybe it was just that i was interested in the movie itself, but joel and the bots did little for me. the movie might have been better without them at all.overall (for the movie itself, not the mst3k), a 3 out of 10. it was an okay flick, for what it was.

boy, this movie is bad. and not in a good, cheesy, fun way, either. even mst3k couldn't stop it from being boring, and it's also confusing as all get out. but the most annoying part of this dull mess is ireland's hideous high pitched voice, which i was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. not to mention how really unappealing her character is. even her dad ran away and abandoned her! i can see why, frankly. if he'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he'd have been tempted to do her a great harm. as i was, by the end of the movie. plus, she's useless and annoying. when she falls down the long hole in the earth a la alice in wonderland, she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably australian accented miner hadn't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into. he should have just tied her to the atlantean version of train tracks and been done with it. and this atlantis underground with the weird, confusing obsession with bone density,i have to ask-where was the light coming from down there? did they have generators that imitate the sun? no matter. there's no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly costumed goth wannabees running around trying to catch kathy(probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth). stupid, pointless film. thank you golan globus, for this cinematic abomination. may you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.

i found this movie really hard to sit through, my attention kept wandering off the tv. as far as romantic movies go..this one is the worst i've seen. don't bother with it.

one commenter said if you like austin powers you will like this movie. i liked autin powers and was disappointed with this movie. the film works hard, maybe too hard for laughs. maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were shouting as if the shouting in itself is suppose to be funny. i get where they were trying to go with this flick. a cross between zorro and the scarlet pimpernel but it just doesn't work. austin powers if silly but intelligent, zorro the gay blade lacks the savvy of austin powers, the big lebowski or kingpin.i kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script. my 15 year daughter also thought the movie was flat. my 17 year old who selected this flick on it's title, walked out after 20 minutes.it seems many people on imdb liked this film, but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy.

this film must have done well in the box office, in order to give gator the budget it deserves. this film had no budget, needed a script rewrite, and a better ending. there is flashes of brilliance in this movie. the boat ride scene, burt driving the mean machine, and his chat with his parents. you can tell burt is a southerner, and not a actor. this movie shows what gator would be like, burt's best film. too, bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the rush. 4/10

burt reynolds plays gator mcklusky, a likable ex-convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff. laid-back reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these 'good ol' boy' performances in; true, he's on auto-pilot throughout. but in his day, reynolds knew just how to make a low-key effort work well for himself. ingratiating and handsome, reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up; he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star, while director joesph sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the south alive. unfortunately, the story isn't much, and supporting actors ned beatty and bo hopkins overact (as usual). diane ladd is fine in a small part, and real-life daughter laura dern can be glimpsed in the background. reynolds returned to this character for 1976's "gator". *1/2 from ****

this movie was terrible. john wayne is a brutal actor at times. the lead female playing the role of "maura" did a good job and tried her best to make scenes believable despite wayne's inept, one dimensional, over acting. seriously, did you see him when he was supposed to be talking in his sleep? ridiculous. and his character became such an awful person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without even so much as a 'sorry'. the story was completely implausible. we were supposed to believe that two grown men, both tremendous successes in their respected fields, would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they disliked one another? you can pretty much randomly select any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to have this film made. its too bad because the only other wayne films i've seen are the shootist and rio bravo, which were both great movies. unless you're being paid don't bother watching this one.

tycoon will never be listed as one of john wayne's better post stagecoach film. it's good in spots, has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax. but the plot leaves a lot to be desired.what we have in tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team. multimillionaire cedric hardwicke has hired john wayne and james gleason to build a railroad. but then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right.things get really complicated when wayne falls for hardwicke's daughter, laraine day. after a night when they have to spend time alone in an inca ruin, by convention in south america, wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened.what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another. their petty spites cause some fatalities among wayne's crew.but what tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness. laraine day was married to leo durocher the manager of the brooklyn dodgers when this was being filmed. he was a constant presence on the set, insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife. nothing to it, but he made his wife's life miserable.not one of the duke's better efforts.

i'm glad that i did not expect too much when i saw this sequel to one of my favourite childhood films. the storyline was dull and unconvincing as were the characters, and i was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. i also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film. charlie had changed, and now, he has a girlfriend. the first film had some good music, but the music in this film was unmemorable. in short, this film just did not do it for me. and, looking at other user feedback, it looks like it didn't do it for a lot of you. it's not worth watching.

i loved all dogs go to heaven so much that i went to see the sequel in the theater, and i can't remember being more disappointed by a movie. the story stank worse than an over-aged sack of manure. i mean, come on! how could carface possibly imagine being able to get revenge on an animal so much bigger than him, no matter how angry he was. plus depicting satan as a cat?!?! how cliché can you get? so much for the story. is it any wonder that don bluth, burt reynolds, melba moore, and vic tayback wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole? the animation was absolutely wretched. the colors were all washed out, and i can't count how many times i was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid. it had to be the worst animation i've ever seen! i usually like animated movies, but not this bomb!

assault on precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film i've seen since charlie's angels 2. the shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. spoilers ............................................................. i know they've said this movie is a remake descendant of rio bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch rio bravo? besides the fact that rio bravo is a western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (john wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang. no one wants to liberate anyone in assault on precinct 13. they want everyone dead. so, my first question would have to be, why not just burn the whole place down from the start? why "assault" the place at all? i know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn't make sense and/or was presented properly. if the veteran cop was in on it from the start, why the need for this whole movie? if the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege, how did he even get the chance? as soon as he appeared at the door he would've been shot and they would've had their entry point. it's all just fubar. what part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) but no one notices?? however, as soon as there's a fire they have to "leave before the fire department shows up"?????? how did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside?? police issue bullets in the walls, bullet casings, footprints, equipment usage, and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of "bishop's men" to be found? how about those police snipers? how could they possibly miss so badly so often? i like the fact that when the two detainees tried to run, the snipers were foiled by two tiny mounds of snow. as if it's not possible to shoot a high powered riffle through a pile of snow. the set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely no reason at all. i know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience. don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one? that particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth (that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt). the conclusion remains steadily stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an austin powers-like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured. i know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of detroit city (>snicker<) but why did ethan's character just wander off in to the woods in the first place? he doesn't even look to see if the suv with the secretary and his friend gets away? they just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods, pistol in hand. gack. i could go on but won't. all i can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost.

the original "assault on precinct 13" is gritty, witty, and - perhaps most importantly - short. this remake is mercilessly padded out and talky. worse yet, the african-american hero of the first movie is here replaced with handsome white boy ethan hawke, which makes this "assault" less progressive than the 1970s one. god, how i miss john carpenter and his improbable plot line and his weird sense of humor. i even miss his b-list actors, who are leagues better than hawke and company.i can't say i care for the new villains in this version - they stretch what little credibility the story ever had to the limit. the female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic hoods, and gabriel byrne gives another of his bored performances. the music's all wrong, too - it's bland action stuff that actually detracts from the tension. simply awful.

the opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero. i wish the entire movie was as gritty and real as the intro.in order to enjoy some movies, a lot can be forgiven,(hand guns with 60 shots, hero's with super human powers, all women are gorgeous and half naked) but puuuuleeese this "assault on my intelligence 13" is so far fetched that i'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming.firstly, how did these guys get to be cops? based on stupidity i guess. how do the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in detroit or wherever the heck they are. as a matter of fact no character reacts to the elements whatsoever in this movie. no windows, no electricity(which miraculously returns unexplained)during the storm of the century and they are all comfy as bugs in a rug. what technology exists which disables all cell phones, radios, and brain function. this must be the same power which causes maria bella to walk from her disabled car knee deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress.

before you dismiss my post as "not getting it", let me say...i'm one of the biggest richard kelly and "the twilight zone" fans out there. donnie darko is one my all-time favorites and i even thought southland tales had it's moments. i'm a huge sci-fi fan. i was very excited to see "the box", couldn't wait for it to come out.having said that..."the box" is terrible. behind "drag me to hell", this was the worst movie i've seen in 2009. and it just simply will not end! whenever you think you've reached the end, another change in the plot and you're off to more torture. i was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the film...i could hardly take it anymore.the biggest problem with "the box", no matter how you slice it or try to justify it, is that it simply makes little sense. trust me, i "got it", i understood what was going on. but that doesn't mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it. take the basics for example. the main couple...cameron diaz and james marsden, playing norma and arthur lewis. diaz loses her finances at her job, then bemoans to her husband that they are "living paycheck to paycheck". well, sell that f-ing porsche your husband is driving then!!! they live in a beautiful 2-story house in a nice subdivision. marsden is working what seems to be a high-paid job at nasa and diaz is an accomplished teacher. and, yes, marsden drives an overly expensive car. but they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? no need to press the button, just cut down your high-priced lifestyle a bit! the movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. instead, they are seemingly desperate for money...all the while living what i would call a luxurious lifestyle. like i said...you can understand what's going on, yet it still makes little sense! that's a rare combination.there was an awful scene in a library that i feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history (terribly acted too by the way). it was idiotic, illogical and out of place. i can't even begin to fully describe it actually, so i will move onto a subplot that involves nose-bleeds and body possession by aliens. (yes, i'm being serious unfortunately). a kid is in diaz's class with a wicked and smile on his face (a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school). he starts asking diaz personal questions, literally embarrassing her in front of her class. no punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk! then diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt, apron and all! i don't know many alien-possessed kids (who appear to be in junior high) that also moonlight as a bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! (see what i mean...you can understand it completely, but it still makes no sense...a rare combo!) like many things in the movie, the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him, no ending to his character. moving on... a lady then approaches diaz in a grocery store, telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens don't want to help diaz...then who was taking over this lady's body and giving diaz advice?! again...the lady was trying to help diaz...and the aliens weren't interested in helping diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! never explained. never talked about again. no nothing!! it goes on and on and on like this for, what seemed to me like, 2 weeks. it would not end! i wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-shoot at some point. it was poorly edited. diaz's accent was there one minute, gone the next. sub-plots began but never ended. the numerous push-backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. it's truly a train-wreck.pass on this one...there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10, just because i like diaz and sci-fi! but it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.thanks for reading! jd

ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this film? yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. where does one start? a lot of the good stuff has already been said - so i won't divulge into the same territory. i believe you already have the movie summary - so i won't paraphrase the movie.first - let's start the with good.1). if you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as i do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live, another to die, or, what if you had to die by drowning or fire) this movie is a great concept - bottom line.2) the wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. realistically though, how difficult is that to accomplish? .....okay, that's about all for the good. let's talk about the bad.1). this movie feels like a 2 hour "twilight zone" episode. this could easily be 90 minutes. that might have made the movie tolerable.2). do you remember in the movie "from dusk til dawn?". the movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? yep - same thing here. i would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. i've gotten deeper thought provocation out of transformers 2.3). yes - we get the dilemma in the film. we understand the philosophical undertones and utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, didn't elaborate on the current story arc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.4). the ending didn't make sense. not at all. none.this movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. if you're board out of your mind, in bed sick, or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie, and can view this free on-line - by all means, go for it.if you need to pay anything to view this movie, don't waste your time - you're better off watching old howie mandel stand-up on you tube. you will get more philosophical stimulation reorganizing your sock drawer.

be warned, the next time you see "richard kelly" involved in any production, run away. fast.kelly proved to the world after his last movie, "southland tales", that he is one pretentious director. it was indulgent and convoluted. in "the box", not much has changed.i can picture what his pitch to warner bros must have been, and i bet the executives at the studio ate it right up: a full-feature film based on one of richard "twilight zone" matheson's old short stories.big mistake! do not read any further unless you want this movie completely spoiled for you: norma (cameron diaz) pushes the button. turns out that arlington steward (frank langella) has an alien using his body as a vessel to conduct "experiments" in which the fate of mankind rests. his face is scarred because he was struck by alien lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. obviously since norma pushes the button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. in the end she and her husband (james marsden) choose to kill norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.kelly dances around his film's "message", trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is. obviously, any person with a brain is saying at the beginning, "what if i was the person who dies?". richard kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal, human conversation. in fact, they avoid it all together. they appear to both be educated, working at a prestigious school and also for nasa, so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to look outside of the box???if he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the entire movie could have ended right there! instead, we have to watch weddings go on forever, nasa and the nsa be complacent to arlington stewart taking over these government programs, teleportation to show marsden life beyond our world so it will be "easier" to kill his wife, and drone's controlled by steward which can be anywhere and nowhere, at any time.the most painful part of this movie is the pacing. nothing really happens. its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable.it is insufferable how this film is being marketed. the commercials make it look like "saw" and even use the music from those films to sell it. in reality what you get is a slow, dull, laughable (yes, half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects), and messy film which is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive. at one point, cameron diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly, she is back in the nsa's big black car with her husband on the way home. where did she go? why did they take her? do we really care? not anymore you won't.by the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters. you will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end. go see anything else that's playing. don't waste your time, or money.

i know that so many reviews on imdb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. i find neither of these kind of reviews helpful, and so i do not give this film the awful review i am about to, lightly. the film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a hollywood blockbuster. the trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved. i like films which challenge the viewer and i do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. no - the film is just terrible. as the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on cameron diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. avoid.

in 1976 a mother named norma lewis (cameron diaz) lives with her son walter and her husband arthur (james marsden). one night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. by the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents norma with an offer. this man is arlington steward (frank langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. if they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. norma and arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. the incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. arthur, who is currently working for nasa, fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut.one's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the short story "button button" by richard matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. the opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. richard kelly's previous film donnie darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. without the dream-like state of that far superior film, the box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is entirely implausible. that norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as two-face from the dark knight and believe this offer, seems equally contrived.if this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other godly being influencing these situations. scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries, random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the lewis family, become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. to a point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. in one scene norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. he taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that norma and arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.what is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. the ending, which won't be spoilt here, resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a greek tragedy. while the resemblances can be seen, by this point, given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to care. cameron diaz's southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make dr. evil proud. it really is just a shadow of his towering performance in frost/nixon. there is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both norma and arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for kelly's pastiche of ideas. underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as where norma sympathises with arlington over their deformities and also when norma and arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them, highlights this.since 2001, richard kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of donnie darko. though this film might be intriguing for a little while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. the box is one film this year that should have been shelved.

circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each better the film features a very gifted cast that mostly perform well , however it totally loses the audience basically everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are backstabbing someone else and working with .... did i lose you? well the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first timer writer , it has some redeeming qualities though in the acting especially famke janssen shines as lily but sadly gets a lot of useless screen time just standing there doing nothing.....the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating but its still worth watching if you're a fan of any of the actors especially john and famke who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossing who every second....

i was fascinated to read the range of opinions on `circus' from `awesome, breathtaking, brilliant' and most things between right down to `golden turkey candidate'. i find myself in the latter camp.the producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over-the-top violence with barrages of four-letter expletives they'd have another `lock, stock and two smoking barrels' on their hands. a pity that they forgot to include wit, style, charm and flair. and it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to welles' classic `the lady from shanghai' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be.john hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity, a huge american drives around in a mini minor as `circus' pathetically strains for cult status and even the beautiful amanda donohoe can't add any class to these proceedings.if you want to see a good brit film try the sublime `wonderland'

would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a "british neo-noir" crime film with a cast almost entirely american? the accents spoken in this film are bloody awful! but entirely in keeping with the performances, which are so wooden, one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire.really, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is this? even neo-noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for, even if they're wretched and doomed; they at least have some decency to them, some sense that what they've done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that somehow they're stuck with the responsibility for it.not in this stanky stew. these characters are putrid, betraying each other, themselves, and the audience.also, note that they are low-lives - all right, nothing wrong with that - except that they seem to be living a life of luxury. for a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves, the keynote here is - ennui. it's all so terribly dull and dross, doncha know. so let's just rip some people off or maybe murder them, and go get laid in a luxury hotel. what ambition! gooping this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are: boringly uneven pacing; predictable 'action' sequences that aren't; banal and incoherent set-design; made-for-bad-tv camera-work and editing; forgettable score; and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction.wholly unbelievable, unlikeable, and for less dedicated movie watchers(or masochists) like myself, utterly unwatchable.there are other nasty things i would like to say about this nasty film, but they wouldn't print them here. suffice it to say, you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film - just about anything, in fact.

garden state was a mediocre film at best. the film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer (zach braff) had, rather than a cohesive story. the disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it weren't interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than "quirky." coincidentally these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in conversation (zack walking past faucets that turn on as he passes, crazy under-cranked party scene, shouting over a gorge, the list goes on).the main character is flat, disengaging, and ultimately unlikable, which is exhibited most in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his fathers problems, including a recently deceased wife, and droning on about his own "what am i to do with my life?" problem.the film ends when andrew (zach braff) decides not to go back to la because he cannot tear himself from the love of his life, sam (natalie portman) whom he has known for 2 days. which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas... sure you could interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities, but if that is the case it could have been done better. much better.this film does not know what it wants to be. a drama, a comedy, a teenage-wasteland film, or a gamut of other things. i say this not as a single-genre oriented person, but as a person who loves multi-genre pieces such as those mastered by stanley kubrick. the reason i feel it does not work for garden state is because rather than blending the genres together, it jumps around; one scene is one genre, the next another, and back again, so on.i have heard many people tell me to cut zach braff some slack, after all it was his first feature film and he debuted as director, writer, and lead actor. impressive as it was a first film, i should think that with as much money as he has, he could do better. there have been much better first-time feature film directors (michel gondry "human nature", david gordon green "george washington"). maybe if he stuck to writing or directing or acting it would have been better. zach braff is a talented performer, maybe his second attempt won't be so tedious and disjointed.

ok, so i gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months, i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool....little did i know that the only cool thing about this cliché-driven turd was precisely its trailer.at the cinema, i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself "no way this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you've only seen 3 minutes" while i rolled my eyes in shame. all those frames showed....get this....a guy with a poker face (because he feels nothing....that's deep) looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame. in the second or third one, he stays awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy...cause he feels nothing), and his father calls, and says "john garden state, is me, your father"....oh come on! i've seen a little more than a couple flicks to hate clichés such as the "is me, your (insert parent)", how the hell am i supposed to react??: "oh, he has a tough relationship with him"....uh....yeah, thats exactly how i'm supposed to react....man, this is a crappy movie...anywho, as the flick goes on, we learn things about his friends, of which everyone is a alternative emo walking indie movie cliché. for example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant who speaks klingon (bizarre characters + pop culture = your standard american indie flick). then we know natalie portman's character, who is a copy of alissa jones (from a movie that kicks gs's butt, chasing amy), amelie and that chick from eternal sunshine... you know, smart, original (not really), cultured, beautiful and...in touch with her sexuality (!). she listens some '70s band named the shins and gives...what? they're from this damn decade?? then why do they sound like that?? oh, they have no personality, ok.....so she hands her cd player to john garden state and he looks at her with a dumb face(you know, love). as the song played on, i heard its lyrics saying "you will love this soundtrack, it is so alternative and cool, you will love this movie, it will define you and your generation even if it is a ideological photocopy of the breakfast club, ghost world and every other smart teen movie from the last 20 years, you will drink coffee and read books you don't understand"...by now, really unoriginal sh!t starts to happen....he doesn't care if he dies in a airplane crash (because he is already dead....and he feels nothing) and he lets us know in a scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called fight club!!!, it is a cool scene but, oh, did i mentioned it appeared in the trailer?.......then in some party, and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual he makes out with a bimbo....so oh, he's not such a emotional zombie after all....clever character development or just a sh!tty movie?......well, lets analyze that scene, it features him sitting motionless in a couch with everyone else moving in really fast speed......scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called requiem from a dream!......so just a sh!tty, sh!tty movie...then they meet more eccentric (cliché, actually) characters, and finally, one that lives next to a big hole in the ground. john garden state says some crap like "good luck exploring your infinite abyss" and the guy says....and by now i wanted to really choke myself, "you too"..............and then we are gently told that neo is jesus....oh no, wait, thats from another dumb, obvious, repetitive, overestimated and cliché piece of crap.finally (finally!!!!), some more crap happens and he enters the big warehouse showdown to defuse the bombs: he has to talk to his dad who he hasn't seen in the last zillion years cause he (finally cool spoilers) killed his own mom....(you see, he killed his mom, so he's also dead.......and feels nothing.....that's deep). now i really expected just clever and moving magnolia-like dialogue between a father and a son......but this is garden state, so this is pretty much it: -john garden state: father, i forgive you, you didn't know what you were doing when you drugged me for a zillion years, but i know you love me -crappy director's dad: no!!! no!!!! i'm gonna say some simple stuff cause i'm not really so deep of a character anyway, like this whole movie actually, so no!!!! -john garden state: no dad, we must get along cause we are equal individuals.....i mean different individuals -crappy director's dad: no!!!!! no!!!!............ok, you convinced me. and he gets the girl (cause he's no longer dead, you know) and the movie ends and i go and eat a piece of chicken that makes my day....this made-for-trailer movie sucks

garden state must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time. the plot is a simple one, involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love. but really, the plot isn't important. what is important to zach braff - writer, director, and star  is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie' or 'arty' film. we therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film (à la wes anderson - or so braff hopes). unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly, braff has not only fooled many on imdb, but also some critics who really ought to have known better.of course, braff's gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make garden state a bad film. what really makes garden state a stinker is braff's script. he simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off, and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal. braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he can't achieve through the writing. for example, the numbness of the braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash (this can't be worked into the plot, and so has to take place in a dream!), later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss (life = a bottomless abyss, very clever mr braff). those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen.on the plus side, the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with (by which i mean a script), and i do admire natalie portman for her efforts as the love interest - a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that braff moulds into his fantasy woman.it apparently took braff 3 years to write the script for garden state (3 years to write a script this bad - he really is inept!). hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film.

this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:"quirky" and obnoxious characters (a few); "quirky" town with "quirky" folk; a "quirky" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of "gotta get out of this town"; downright booooring.and it succeeds on all counts.something to note, though. i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-northern exposure "quirky" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. who are they and what the h--- did they have to do with anything? and this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concering kids that seem to span generations. i don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time. huh? what did i miss?avoid. unless for laughs. or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing.

i couldn't help but laugh when i saw what the public could be made to think was email back in 1996. apparently email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with lame voice synthesis reading every comment out loud. and some of the other "tech" aspects are also laugh-out-loud funny. i'd swear the "high tech" communications centre she has actually has a few commodore 64 monitors in it. almost like watching the movie hackers nowadays, i guess.despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow i can't ignore. i mean, why include something so stupid? anyway, to sum up: the plot is pretty predictable, the acting bad, the killer quite guessable. but it can be amusing in a mystery science theatre 3000 kind of way i guess.

ok.. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating. my guess is that only the film crew voted. so i'm here to bring some justice to it all.never has a movie provoked the audience's intelligence more than this one. given, i laughed out loud quite a bit - but the movie/story absolutely didn't want me to.i've seen a lot of bad movies. a lot. but man, this one blows them all away.speaking '96 computers, ridiculous acting, and wheelchair chases - and we have young tarantinos who can't get their ideas financed. yup, life's a cruel joke.

after high school track & field athelete, laura remstead, dies of natural causes during a race (an event that is shown multiple times, in slow-motion none-the-less), an unknown killer is murdering all the people who were on that same aforementioned team close to graduation day (hence the name)in this laughably inept slasher flick.it brings absolutely nothing new (or even good) to the slasher table, instead opting to merely unleash the most god-awful song i've heard in quite some time with ' gangster rock' being played in a roller-disco party that went on far too long.eye candy: denise cheshire & linnea quigley get topless my grade: d-

the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie. i can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing, if not for the die-hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see -everything- from that era. otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.the story is similar to most films of its type: something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. been there, done that. truth be told, none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality, so i can't see the point in harping on the film simply for this.but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. i've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. this one just fails to create any real suspense. the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not frightened. the gore is pretty tame as well, so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed.the movie manages to clunk along rather dully. honestly, the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing--you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals, because, let's face it, we don't watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots. but the pacing, whether due to the script or the editor, is all off. the murders are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long-winded scenes (no doubt meant to build "character") that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill (which, as i've said, usually isn't executed all that well anyway).as for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening. he (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask, and his (or her?) primary weapon is a sword. i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original, "cool" murder weapon, but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly. there's also not much emphasis placed on the "whodunnit' nature of the film, as if they either forgot or don't care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off.i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable, and at times, it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era. but alas, the attempt fails for the most part. there is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film). there is attempt at characterization, but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end, so...what a waste. here, all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough.in the end, if you're really into these old '80s slashers, by all means, check it out, if only to say you've seen it. there's a completest in all of us. but don't expect to be blown away or anything. what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all.

this movie was sheer, slow, plodding torture. not being a fan of slasher films, and preferring classic horror, i may not be the best judge. slasher fans may enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre. i really would like the 90 minutes i spent watching this back. the only reasons to watch this are 1) a young vanna white (pre wheel of fortune) who has about 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) an early role by scream queen linnea quigley (with nudity), and legendary beauty ej peaker as the school secretary, who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. otherwise, an 80's band called felony makes an appearance, which while interesting, drags on way too long. just like the movie.....i had to keep checking how much time was left and couldn't wait to "graduate" to a better film.

for me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. the reviews i've written thus far have been for films that i love, respect, and admire, and i have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. a life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out. i only recently began reviewing films for the imdb, and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites, examining those which i believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre. however, the existence of films like "graduation day" is, without pun, a thorn in my side. completely devoid of any merit whatsoever, this 1981 hodgepodge of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema. during the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release, we saw the appearance of domestic (and canadian) films such as "halloween ii," "prom night," "terror train," "madman," "my bloody valentine," "the prowler," "just before dawn," "final exam," and "hell night," among others. these films, though of varying degrees of quality, clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line, plotting, acting, direction, and overall tone. not every movie released during this bountiful season of the slasher era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original "halloween" or "friday the 13th," but these films were all well-made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema. "graduation day," an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by herb freed, whom one can only hope will never again attempt to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty. the task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. this movie fails miserably on every possible level, not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances, dime-store special effects, an irritating musical score, and, most of all, a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense. a pointless exercise in how to waste film, "graduation day" is an utter disgrace to horror cinema.

"graduation day" - i bought this movie this past week and waited for some time where i could kick back and relax and watch some "good" 80's slasher gems, i got this and "xtro" to watch, never seen any of them. i just watched it and realized my outdoor speakers were on also. i only imagine what my neighbors thought when "felony" came on to sing their one 10 minute hit? i'm sure it was loud and i'm sure they think i'm weird, with that and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other movies.this was a pretty sub par slasher movie, no suspense, no story, some cool deaths, almost seemed on the amateur side, i usually like movies like that, but it just didn't click with me, now i will watch "xtro" for the 1st time and have a margarita!dj eric austin tx

pretty lame and awful slasher about someone killing the members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a meet.christopher george gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the track team's coach. i don't think anyone has ever taken track and field as seriously as chris does here - not even in the olympics. it's a typically divine cg performance, and if you are a fan of the man/the legend, you should run right out and grab a copy.but we watch slashers for the murders (you know it's true), not the performances, and graduation day fails to deliver on most counts (there is one really good kill). true horror only comes during a performance by the band "felony". never heard of 'em? watch graduation day and find out why.

this film is slow. this film is cheap. this film makes friday the 13th look like a best picture nominee. the acting is crap. the special effects are crap. no one dies for like 40 minutes and all the people do is act badly. the only thing that saves it is it's ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity going on. the funniest part is watching the heroine "fight off" the attacker. she supposed to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old. they spend pointless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who do die to the point where you don't even know why they are dieing. i love slashers but this is just crap.

first and foremost i wish to aim a big & mean middle-finger towards the troma dvd-distribution crew, who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the back of the cover! the synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day, for christ's sake! i don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be; just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point! so, a word of advise in case you also purchase the troma double-feature containing "graduation day" and "nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell", do not  repeat do not  turn the box around and read the back! watching the film is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything.now, as for the actual the actual movie oh boy! personally i'm a fan of the cinematic 'work' of herb freed. well actually, i don't really know whether i should admire himor pity him! all herb's films are pretty bad & amateurish, but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions! unlike with "haunts" and "beyond evil", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films. just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims in "graduation day" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach george michaels (awesome name! i guess herb freed is a fan of "wham!"). during the opening credits, we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field, moments after winning a 30 seconds running race. the debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised, but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he/she considers responsible for laura's death. what a demented little movie! the script must be one of the most incoherent ones i ever beheld, with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! there's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes! herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film! for example, laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death. halfway through the movie, however, her character hardly appears in the movie anymore. also, the girls' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well. instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings, we're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and  of course  numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off. despite being really bad, "graduation day" could count on a respectable cast! christopher george ("grizzly", "city of the living dead") greatly stars as the demanding coach, carmen argenziano ("when a stranger calls", "the accused") briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and michael pataki ("dead & buried", "dracula's dog") has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal. the teenage beauties on duty include linnea quigley and vanna white. heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count "graduation day" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's. it's a dumb film, but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed!

an interesting slasher film with multiple suspects.includes typical girl flashing her breasts (denise cheshire) as she changes into her swimsuit, creepy suspect - any one of them could be doing the deed, expected breast baring to get a passing grade (linnea quigley), a very unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, a track and field event that will not be in the summer olympics, and a ghoulish secret.it all comes to a crashing ending. no, there's more. won't this guy die? i bet anne (patch mackenzie) doesn't plan any more visits home anytime soon.if you like teen slasher films, can you possible be a pervert, even if all the actresses are over 18?

after their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.from the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). the 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events i've ever seen in a film. it would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life. not just run track. . . but, run at all. ever. from there, we get a horribly unrealistic female navy member who was breaking numerous appearance rules with her jewelry and make-up, not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose onto her collar while in uniform. ridiculously awkward camera angles, pathetically done gore effects, and acting that ranged from frighteningly over-the-top to boringly under done (all in one actor, mind you) all help to make this film one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever made. on the other hand, the writing wasn't all that terrible and the story was actually okay. but, the direction was horrible, made worse by offensively bad cinematography. the acting ranged from acceptable to just plain abysmal. regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements, however, there's something here, whether it be cheese or something else that i can't figure out, that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch. maybe it was just vanna white.obligatory slasher elements:- violence/gore: death scenes were fun enough, but the gore was just awful: blood squirts from impossible angles, no actual gashes or wounds from knives, etc. but, this film has the first 'death by football' scene i've ever seen.- sex/nudity: there was a bit of nudity (i mean, linnea quigley is in it, after all), and some overly horny high schoolers, but nothing to excess.- cool killer(s): if you think leather gloves, stop watches, track suits, and fencing masks are cool, this one is for you.- scares/suspense: not really any at all. there is one moment that takes place in the girls' locker room that i was preparing myself to be scared at. . . but, it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for me.- mystery: a little, but if you can't figure out the killer's identity about 20 minutes into the film, then i'm not too sure about your powers of deduction.- awkward dance scene: there's a great impromptu jam session ("graduation day blues") with a guitar & harmonica that leads to some awesome 80s bopping. this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the film.final verdict: 4/10. don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it (just like most everything else troma touches).-ap3-

six months after high-school sprinter laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.what it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen linnea quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!).so forget the death scenesthey're lame and rather bloodlessand instead enjoy the movie's more memorably crap elements: the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures; the roller disco, which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song, ' gangster rock', as performed by the unforgettably awful felony; an impromptu jamming session by the school's students; christopher george hamming it up as chief red-herring coach michaels; and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students (who, for some reason, find him quite irresistible?!?!).towards the end of the film, the action picks up a little, with the discovery of the slaughtered kids' bodies under the bleachers, and a quite twisted scene featuring laura's corpse in her cap and gown, but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity.

next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, "graduation day"! all of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. that is, however, if they can make it to graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the navy for graduation. the track coach holds the blame and broods in his demoted position in shop-class while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later... all of these characters are prime candidates for "serial slasher of the year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-done-it. "graduation day" is fun, though it isn't spell-bindingly original by any means and there aren't a whole lot of memorable demises, but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained. like linnea quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint, 30 year-old actors playing teenagers, and of course... rollerdisco! gotta love that crap! you can do a lot worse than "graduation day", kiddies...

a high school track star falls dead after winning a race; shortly after, her older sister (patch mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all of her sister's track team members are disappearing. who could the killer be? you may not care enough to want to find out.crude, cheap, amateurish slasher is just about completely worthless, although top-billed christopher george (as the nasty, hard-driving track coach) tries to give it a lift with an intense performance. not even the gore is worth mentioning. the whole thing is lame from beginning to end, starting with opening the movie to a track meet montage set to disco music, and the casting of e.j. peaker, once a co-star of the movie "hello, dolly" as a character named "blondie"! that's right, "blondie". this may mean that we aren't supposed to take the movie seriously, but in any case it's a shambles.it's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes the "friday the 13th" movies look like works of art in comparison.the only point of interest may be wanting to see an early film appearance by vanna white, of all people.2/10

i've got to say that i'm not a massive fan of troma films. granted, i've only seen three of them (or four including this one), but two (blood sucking freaks and mothers' day) are widely reputed to be the best, which leads me to believe that all the others aren't worth seeing. that would certainly seem to be the case with graduation day, which is a troma take on the over-popular eighties slasher. while the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it's never particularly good either; and by the end, all i could think about was 'why did i bother watching this?'. anyway, the plot sees some girl die on a race track, and shortly thereafter; more people start dying. naturally, there are a few possible suspects; but it's hard to really care about anything that happens. of course, in slasher terms; it's the gore that is most important, and given troma's track record where the red stuff is concerned, i was expecting buckets of it. there are some decent kill scenes, and some of them are gory; but it's never very shocking, which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the american calendar. it's worth noting that there's a small role in this film for sleaze queen linnea quigley, but the rest of the cast aren't worth mentioning. the direction, plot and its execution are all very mundane; and i will say that unless you're a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made; don't bother with this film.

high school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against coach george michaels(christopher george playing him as a major butt-head who is very demanding of the athletes under his watch). he'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of. soon disturbed parents call principal guglione(michael pataki)wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party. inspector halliday(carmen argenziano)begins snooping around campus at worried parents' request. instantly a beleaguered michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker. ensign anne(patch mackenzie)returned home from her base in guam to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene. kevin badger(e danny murphy)is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star.rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably. low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak. linnea quigley has an amusing role as horny student dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud(the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed dolores outside of the prom party). vanna white has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker. virgil frye has a silly role as an inept officer.

"graduation day" is a result of the success of "friday the 13th." both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. if you enjoy that type of film, i'd recommend "graduation day." if not, i wouldn't. there's nothing new here, just the same old killings.even though i've given the film a 4 out of 10, i will say that it's not a repulsive film. it is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative.

"graduation day" was released in may 1981, during the height of the slasher film craze. earlier that year, fans had been subjected to flicks like "my bloody valentine", "just before dawn", "friday the 13th part 2", and "the burning" and theaters still were expecting flicks such as "halloween ii", "the prowler", and "happy birthday to me". i have seen all of these films, and out of all the popular 1981 slashers "graduation day" is by far the worst.what "graduation day" amounts to is an exercise in poor, low-budget film-making with bad acting, bad writing, pointless characters, pointless scenes, unneeded nudity, cheesy dialogue, and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well. and who could forget the classic 80's disco music that plays throughout the film (the opening scene's music is only rivaled by the music that plays during a chase scene). however when renting a movie like this a person should be aware that those details will be in this film. so why isn't "graduation day" considered a classic like "halloween", "friday the 13th", "a nightmare on elm street", "my bloody valentine", "the burning", or "prom night"? why do fans still seek those films but disregard this without care?where slasher films need to succeed above all other areas is in the pacing. there is nothing worse than a slow moving slasher, and "graduation day" moves pretty slow. the most aggravating part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up; there are numerous pointless characters who are introduced and who are never allowed the chance to be a suspect in the murders or be a victim. there's a sleazy teacher, a stressed principal, a cunning secretary, a dopey school security guard, a clueless detective, an alcoholic step father, a mindless grandmother, and a mom to an earlier victim still grieving. all of these characters could have a motive to killing or a reason to getting killed, but they are all wasted. the worst part is that the story still focuses on them, and at times designates entire scenes just to flesh out their character. but for what?what does amaze me about "graduation day" and its small fanbase is that people aren't more amazed by the death scenes. fans go wild for death scenes like the raft massacre in "the burning", the washing-machine death in "my bloody valentine", the kabob death in "happy birthday to me", the upside down death in "friday the 13th part 3", and hot tub death in "halloween ii", and even the car hood death in "madman". but where is the respect for some truly unique (even though cheesy) deaths in "graduation day". one victim gets impaled right through the jugular with a fencing sword, while another gets that sword thrown at them like a javelin. the best death includes spikes under a landing mat. why aren't these deaths famous among the genre like the deaths in more popular slasher films?"graduation day" tries hard to be a great and unique film, but there is just an element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience. its not the worst of its kind (try checking out "don't go in the woods... alone") and there is a bit of suspense, plus it delivers just what fans are looking for (blood, gore, nudity, sex, and nostalgia) but "graduation day" will not be remembered as one of the all time greatest slasher films ever made. it's not a question of budget - almost all slashers have a low-budget - however it is a question of ideas, creativity, and craftsmanship. that's all any type of movie making is...recommended for hardcore slasher fans. general horror fans might get a little bored, and people who don't have much interest in horror at all should steer clear. it's not the worst slasher film ever made, but its a long way from being the best.

while i am a long-time shatner fan (since we used to watch trek re-runs over the dinner hour in the early '70s), i cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film, whether for personal development or business reasons. did he lose a bet?as a movie fan, i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones. but "shoot or be shot" doesn't have any flair or funny bits, unintentional or not.while unrated, there were no objectionable scenes (blink or you'll miss it nudity, cartoonish gunfire "violence" with the endless bullet gunfights), so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the mpaa to rate it. this will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out.of the eight people that were in the theatre with us, four of them left mid-way, muttering statements like "this is stupid".shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter. the examination board stamps his request "insane". he runs into a group of z-grade moviemakers who "shoot on video because its 80% cheaper than film" and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint. there are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters, but for the most part, that is the whole movie.if you want to spend 90 minutes on a shatner "art" film, see "free enterprise" instead, it is a much better film.

first off, i am a huge fan of tolkien, and as one i will base most of my critic on his books.the movie is a standard adventure movie, well made with nifty special effects, nice sound track and fine acting. now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews wouldn't be half this good as they are here.the problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from tolkiens books but then it goes and "hollywoods" everything it can, numerous scenes from the book are eighter missing or changed quite a lot, the characters are changed from the book also, a thing that i think should be punishable ! what the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it, i know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book, and it didn't work here eighter, mostly the motivation of the characters is left hazy at best.as a adventure movie it would rate 7+ / 10 as a adaptation of tolkien it rates 2 / 10i mean honestly, what on earth was arwen doing at rivendell ford ? and as for the comments that this movie "is the best ever" i can only say that eighter you are very young, or you havent seen good movies...peter jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings.

if you haven't read tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! if you have however... after having read the books several times, over many years, i have come to love the characters and story, and feel i know it intimately. i have my own personal vision of the shire, hobbiton and the character-gallery. thus for me the movie was a disappointment. why? it dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline. great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is, is simply ignored. even 2001 special effects can't do tolkien's (and your own) imagination justice. peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible, and i don't think anyone else could have done it better! but the fact remains, i regret seeing the movie. the next time i read the lord of the rings, peter jackson's limited vision will leap forward, not my own.

no doubt about it, rampling is gorgeous -- a classic beauty, here very young. she manages to appear simultaneously sophisticated and poignant. her two male foils act well too. but seen in 2003, the flic is allamerican-trying-to-be-artsy-and-not-be-hollywood-while-shooting-beautiful-sh ots-of-the-french-riviera-and-three-pretty-young-people-in-their-cute-old-ca r. i enjoyed the view (both the actors and the nature) but the movie is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite.

well, at least we have to acknowledge the big hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in america, they now discovered they could simply hire the asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. that's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! "the messengers" is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the oriental countries ever since "ringu". roughly translated, this means it's a boring, overlong and entirely gore-free film, but it does feature copious amounts of false scares and embarrassingly weak "did we scare you yet?" moments. the pang brothers (danny & oxide) previously made the extremely overrated "the eye" and it sort of is a tradition for them to build up a story with clues and hints towards a point where it becomes nearly impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audiences, yet they don't seem eager to alter their formula any time soon. and they're also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old & repetitive ghost topics over and over again. restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote countryside farm? the protagonist family torn apart by unprocessed traumas from the past, so they first have to restore faith and trust in each other? give me a break! throw in a videotape and a seven-days-curse, why don't you? even the attempts to make you jump in your seat are too déjà-vu and won't scare anyone over the age of 7. slamming doors, filthy & gradually larger growing stains on the walls, ghostly appearances, noises coming from the cellar... the endless overuse of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming insulting to horror fans. "the messengers" revolves on a family on their way to a new life in the country as the growers of sunflowers. the family situation is kind of dysfunctional since a personal tragedy (which doesn't get revealed until late in the film) caused their youngest son to stop talking and the parents to distrust their revolting teenage daughter. soon after, the children experience strange presences in remote farmhouse, but they don't manage to convince their parents to leave. that's pretty much concludes the entire film. little ben sees things but he can't talk and jessica repeatedly gets attacked by supernatural forces but nobody listens to her. the basic premise of "the messagers" is very derivative of stanley kubrick's immortal classic "the shining", only it lacks the constantly ominous atmosphere and disturbing tone. the script takes itself far too seriously even though it's fairly easy to predict the final denouement and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. at least "the eye" delivered some genuine shocks in the end, whereas the happy happy joy joy ending of "the messengers" is just pathetic. the only positive elements i can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations, the adequate editing job and the promising young acting talents (and beauty) kristen stewart. and there's an uncanny, but sadly underdeveloped supportive role for william b. davis.

very dull, laborious adaptation of amis's amusing satire. the hero is portrayed not as a likeable loser but a merely oafish cretin. most of the rest are pure caricatures with only helen mccrory putting in real quality and providing something of the novel's wit. the period setting is camped up as if it were the 1920s, not the post-war period of horror comics and rock'n' roll. a real dud even by the standards of bad uk tv.

in this silly symphony, a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city. most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table. the animation is fine, where this short suffers is in a lack of humor. perhaps i've just seen this "dinner table adventure" in one too many tom and jerry shorts. even though this came first, i just didn't find it that enjoyable.

this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going, but never really did. it was simply boring to watch, so much in fact i could just never really get into it. this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination, the cover of the videotape made it out to be one. instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting. of course, it does not help this movie at all. mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the 1970's called "the deep". bunch of looking for treasure, rival groups that sort of thing. there are supernatural twists in it too, but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were. i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead, or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcio's "zombie" movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie. that day we learned a valuable lesson, never rent a movie based on its cover art.

***minor plot spoilers***i must confess to having a soft spot for wayne crawford. i know little about him, but he appears to have masses of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent. in his films he usually performs multi-tasks - perm any 3 from lead male, director, producer and script-writer - tackling story lines from the sub-basement. despite this the end product is usually enjoyable fun for the non-discerning.'the evil below' features crawford as a down-on-his-luck captain of a ramshackle charter boat, a bit like bogart in 'to have & have not' - the similarities between the films ends here though.the story begins with an underwater scene with two divers searching a wreck, before being attacked by an unseen creature - bit like the start of 'jaws 2'. the wreck turns out to be that of the 'el diablo', which went down centuries earlier. the ship was manned by heretic priests on the run from spain, with a cargo of stolen church treasure. this allows the introduction of various links to supernatural forces with lucifer and the armageddon both getting a look in. the films title refers to this sunken devil-ship, rather than any malevolent sea-creature.whatever faults the film has (and there are many) it is fun to watch and competently made. you can't help but like a film which, in the final 5 minutes, copies the famous beach scene in 'from here to eternity' and the final line from 'casablanca'.

max cash a charter boat captain who works off the caribbean island san sebastian is hired by sarah, who's looking for legendary boat, el diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. but something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew anything about it are being killed.i have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. instead what we ended up with was a low-rent, b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'the deep', but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. the story is a tame muddle (so many inconsistent angles don't make a lick of sense and encourages a blotchy pace) and the technical side is clunky. nice exotic location and under-water photography though. while the carefree performances weren't too bad either. a gruff wayne crawford is enjoyably witty and june chadwick is fair along side him. sheri able is pretty much eye candy. there are some bizarre developments that amuse and one or two eerie sequences. however there's a real lack of cohesion. most of the cutaway deaths happen off-screen, except for the bloody, fitful opening kills done by something unseen. again just another thing that leaves you high and dry. the music is generic with its thumping cues to warn us of approaching danger and the pov shots get a good working out. tatty, but watchable.

the evil below starts on 'the straits of san sebastian 1683' as the 17th century treasure ship the el diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. jump to 'the straits of san sebastian present day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the el diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. captain max cash (wayne crawford) owns & runs a boat-for-hire named the 'vagrant viking' which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive & generally explore the islands. sarah livingstone (june chadwick) is an art teacher who dives for treasure as a hobby (well we all have to do something to pass the time right?), she hires max & his scantily clad assistant tracy (sheri able) so she can try to locate the el diablo & get rich. talk of sunken treasure excites some of the more unscrupulous members of the local community, as they dodge the criminals & thugs it is brought to max & sarah's attention that the el diablo has a sinister past, a past that supposedly still leaves it's supernatural legacy behind even now...directed by jean-claude dubois, according to the imdb with a little help from star crawford although the version i saw only listed dubois, i thought the evil below had some potential & is a bit different but unfortunately that's not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone. the script by arthur payne starts off ok with the two divers being killed by some sort of sea creature but this opening is never referred to again, the creature is never seen again & there are no more supernatural killings. the evil below then suffers from a serious & terminal case of identity crisis, it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be as it chucks bits & pieces of various genres in there from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime & it even has time to throw in a little murder mystery & religious nonsense as well. as a result the evil below feels very bitty, fragmented & since the best scene in the entire film is the opening sequence i found myself sat there becoming more & more frustrated at the lack of any consistent horror as it went downhill rapidly & the fact we never see the sea creature thing again. the evil below is dull, slow, uneventful, predictable, silly & lacks any sort of charm or intelligence, in short the evil below doesn't do anything right that a good film should.director dubois fails to liven things up although he obviously shot plenty of underwater wildlife material as at times i thought i was watching a national geographic documentary with all the shots of fish, coral & the wildlife in general. forget about any gore, some blood stained water & blood coughing is about as gory as it gets i'm afraid.technically the evil below is very basic, it's bland & totally forgettable apart from nice underwater photography of fish. this is point & shoot stuff & as a whole the production values are very low, even the place where this was shot doesn't look very sunny or appealing. the acting is poor, but then again did you expect anything else?the evil below is a poor film, it's basic story is all over the place & it can't decide what it wants to be & as a result it ends up being a mess. add that to the low production values, the fact there's no gore here & absolutely minimal horror content you have a film that is probably best avoided unless your absolutely desperate & even then surely there are better ways to spend 90 plus minutes of your life...

the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. it starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that's the only blood in the entire film.the evil below isn't the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. the acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads. there's a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn't know what to do. i manged to sit through it all (just about) but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. horror fans might want a copy for the cool vhs cover, but it's best left at that.

i had high hopes for this movie i even gave up a night of watching stargate for this movie. i found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing. i might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version, as i have watched that one every year for the last 20 or so years. i doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic, as the other one has. if you have not seen the 19546 version, you might like this one but, i seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one. this has some nifty special effects but that is not what i look for when telling a movie like the ten commandments. i was kind of looking to see how they told the story, and the writers did not do a good job with this one.

i watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology,out do cecil b. demille's classic epic of 1956, starring charleton heston,yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke. of course, i was let down. yes, they had all the biblical characters correct, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, that held your interest throughout the first movie. if you going to have a mini-series, you have to have some "rivoting" scenes, the "burning bush", parting the "red sea",drowning "pharohs armies", "building sethi's pyramids", could have been done with todays' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as "lord of the rings" or the matrix. obviously, they didn't want to leave a lasting impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is much needed in these trouble times.

the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. this was a good rendition of the story. i enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story. but the second half was horrible!!! yes there were violent aspects of this story. but the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things god did for the israelites. towards the end of the movie scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from god. this rendition had some huge problems with deviation from scripture. and big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! their portrayal of moses as this screaming naked lunatic who did all of this against his will is totally false. it showed a moses who had to scream in order to get god to talk to him. wrong the scripture says god spoke to moses all the time and not just after a temper tantrum. they got the people's complaining right, but failed to show that god spoke to moses at sinai in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe.(chapter 19). they also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud which guided them in the day and night.what was the whole joshua thing? the righteous peace loving jew who would not fight until moses threatens him? wrong (he was known as a great warrior) what about the great speech that moses gave the army telling them god had helped them enough and now they were on their own?? wrong (they only won through god's help as shown in their own scenes with moses lifting his staff)and what was that sorry looking ark of the covenant? instead of overlaying it with gold this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold chips to it! oh yeah, it was a "molten calf" not a straw one with little chips tacked on. someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the egyptians. you wouldn't know it from this sorry looking bunch.by the way, the part about them slaying the israelites after the golden calf incident says "men" and does not mention women and children which the movie delighted in showing the viewers. oh yeah - manna wasn't the only thing sent from heaven - don't forget the birds for meat. also, the bible mentions jethro bringing moses his wife and children and then says jethro went back to his own land. it does not say that moses gave up his family.oh well, if you know nothing about the real story, read exodus for yourself. if you know the real story, you will hate this version.

i nearly fell asleep during a screening of this. of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. after a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways.the male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his "one true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love.in the meanwhile, he hooks up with one ugly guy (who i thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher, and some guy who ends up having a "three-second sexual intercourse session" with him in a back alley.it never ceases to amaze me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds, such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm! all of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to which he discards their telephone numbers.there is a brief side-plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. there is also another brief side-plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window. and there is also one more brief side-plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person.none of these things really connect with each other, only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. he seems to be living life like a ghost. there was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world's saddest song on it.otherwise, this movie just seems to go on forever. filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamlike, but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare!i found the ending to be confusing as i wasn't quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven? that would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe. but seeing as this is an "independent film", movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to "use your imagination". for those of you who are seeking out nudity, there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows. in other words, don't waste your time with this one.my rating - 2 out of 10

boy oh boy, does this movie stink. this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen in my whole entire life. please, even if your life depends on it, do not, and i repeat: do not under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage. only watch this thing when it comes on as a mst 3000 episode. that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing. if i had to watch it without that show, i would've stopped watching it before it was over. it does have one use: a cure for insomniacs!!!!!

this joins the endless line of corny, predictable 50's sci-fi shlock out there. as usual, it's pretty bad. there isn't much of a plot that i could detect and the over-exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs. the title is misleading also. catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed, and it's better left that way.

i suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because boy did the filmmakers botch it. the plot is practically incomprehensible, the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. and what the hell is a trade rat? worst of all, though, this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate. the only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark-haired woman... well, the blond girl was pretty too, but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette. anyhoo, as with a lot of movies, this is one to be seen only on mst3k.

as a kid, this movie scared me green. as an adult, i couldn't stop laughing.i have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via mst3k. i caught it, instead, on a late saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves. i figured, this had to be better. i was wrong.the movie has some very good elements; a water-divining mystic, a beatnik painter, couple of idiot ranch hands, an elderly history buff, and an "evil wind." um...i mean...evil head. an evil head which will, as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each and every one present is complete, be looking for its evil body.the whole story takes place on an evil "ranch" which apparently neither grows crops, nor raises evil livestock.as everything is declared by their resident mystic to be "evil," you either roll your eyes horribly, or laugh til your sides split, depending on your mood. me? i laughed until i had tears streaming down my face.i remembered this movie fondly as one of those which really scared me as a kid. but some kids are afraid of santa claus, too..no? anyway... if you're into 50's horror camp, then this is definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. if you're looking for a good story line, this movie has that. it's the over the top dramatics and downright innocence of the time that makes it so horrid. the acting was just bad, but it still had some good elements. perhaps it rates a remake...? it rates a 4.3/10 from...the fiend :.

jessica is a young, virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. jessica is also a powerful psychic, capable of dowsing, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. when young and handsome gordon hawthorne comes to visit, he is instantly skeptical of jessica's powers...until her skills uncover a lost wristwatch and unearth an ancient treasure chest. however, the treasure chest holds the severed head of a centuries dead satanist named gideon drew, whose powers are far stronger than jessica's. despite her warnings of the evil in their midst, drew manages to mentally enslave everyone unfortunate to make eye contact with him. but drew wants jessica most of all. he needs her dowsing skills to unearth his body, so that he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race. will jessica's powerful fleur de lis, combined with gordon's love, ward the ancient evil off before it can destroy them all?this isn't a very interesting movie. it certainly could have been - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the acting is leaden and the whole thing moves much too slowly to hold interest. jessica is also too innocent - almost annoyingly so, and gordon, her love interest, is wooden, stiff and totally emotionless. none of the characters are very likable, and the low budget is painfully obvious. a rushed ending also doesn't help matters. avoid, unless it's the mst3k version.

if you ever visited shenandoah acres as a child and wondered, could there be a worse vacation spot in the world? well, you could have watched this movie and had your answer. flavia (a.k.a. fistula) macintyre's dude ranch is often frequented by business casual gordon, at least since resident water witch, jessica, was 13. but jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that divining rod  buried "tray-shure," lost jewelry, dead bodies, even a talisman that will keep her from dressing like a slut and raising drinks with a phony beat and a suzanne pleshette look-alike while hypnotized by a disembodied head. evil, evil evil.

yes this movie features a gal named jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too (well she only causes a tree to fall once, but she does say everything is evil). this movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people, but offers little else in the way of entertainment. jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy. of course they don't know this until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box containing the head. the head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can so it can get to jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body. this movie has an interesting enough story, but it plays out very bad here. everyone in this flick will get on your nerves at least once.

for all its many flaws, i'm inclined to be charitable towards "thing". there is the nugget of an interesting, creepy, claustrophobic hitchcock style story here. put this in the hands of a writer like theodore sturgeon or (if you prefer british perspective) robert bloch, or the guy who wrote "day of the triffids", and you might have had a nasty, unsettling little spook story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense stories.however, someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie, and a cheap, 2nd rate at that, and so most of the potential is wasted. a story like this really needs a voice like sturgeon's to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light. his classic story "the -widget-, the -wadget-, and boff" is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing, sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met. a good writer can, with a few chosen words, make the reader "see" some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotions.instead, we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing "where did that come from??" moments that just lie there. (ie the blond psychic girl declaiming that "you're all evil and i hope you are destroyed!"). we get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull sets and stiff actors. i blame the director for the 'stiff and shallow' part. these are all 3rd rank character actors who never made the big time, but they are also 'real' actors, and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them. we get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff. (if i'm going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it, i want done by stuff staged better than this). and we get over an hour of creepy build-up diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climaxes i've ever seen.good things about "thing"? um, well...some of the closeup shots of the warlock's head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective. the miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life (even if i wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth). the first scene where the big, "simple" ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value, because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character. and like i said earlier, the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance.which this definitely is.but, as i said, i'm inclined to be charitable, because the director was probably working under a penurious budget, breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money. heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like "the cave", "wrong turn" or the remake of "house of wax" 40 years from now. i hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock.

while out divining for water, a young psychic woman named jessica burns (carolyn kearney) stumbles upon something else altogether. she discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for, the chest contains the head of gideon drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by sir francis drake. telepathically controlling the hired-hand who opened the chest, drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body  also buried on jessica's aunt's farm. while jessica is certain she feels the presence of evil, can she put a stop to drew's plans and will she be in time to prevent his becoming whole? i thought i was fairly familiar with most of universal's horror output prior to 1960, but this is one universal film from the 50s that certainly gets little mention. while the thing that couldn't die isn't what i would call a "good" movie, it does have a few things going for it. first, the film has some interesting ideas and is actually rather ambitious. director will cowan, whether by luck or intention, is able to give the movie some nice atmosphere from time-to-time. and, the special effects involving the head are certainly creepy. but the whole project is undone by the acting. i'm shocked to learn that any of the supposed "actors" in this thing ever appeared in anything else. you would think that this was a "one and done" type of movie for most of those involved. kearney is the worst offender. she's horrible. also, the thing that couldn't die may have been a bit too ambitious for its own good. given the budget and other limitations, there was no way the movie could aspire to its more lofty ideas. finally, the movie ends rather abruptly. just as things are starting to get interesting, the end. what's that about?

i love this movie. even though i rated it a "4", that's because the acting, the plot and the budget were all slated to the "b" universe even before this movie was released. but that's ok! it is an entertaining film that has a lot to offer! i remember what leonard maltin said about "plan 9 from outer space": a film so bad that it's great! lacking the ufo - alien plot, the thing the couldn't die relies on the supernatural (divination, a buried head looking for it's body, hypnosis, etc) to tell it's story. the acting is stilted, the camera work second class and the settings are limited, but boy! what a movie! this film is available in the bootleg market. if you find a copy, buy it!

yes,the movie is not a piece of art but the first time i watched it i was 10 years old,my parents were out and i stayed home with my two brothers.it was may 1970(i know that because i found a note about the cycle of horror movies that one network had).it's one of the most vivid memories i have with the guys.we ended all in one bed and covered up to the head! our very first horror movie! we kept talking about it for years and laughing about the moment.those were horror movies.nowadays horror movies are always the same.or was it better when we were kids enjoying without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogs? most sure it was that.but for me this is a great movie!

hollywood had a long love affair with bogus arabian nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. the most memorable were the jon hall, maria montez films which have long since become camp. this one is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and slapstick. it's a truly bounteous crop of mesopotamian corn, and pretty near intolerable today. it was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age, consisting mainly of trick photography. the only outstanding, positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity. sad to say, of the many films made in this genre, few of them come up to alexander korda's original "thief of baghdad". almost any other arabian nights film is superior to this one, though. it's a loser.

this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a "is this for real??" sort of way. it was so cheesy and low budget...they should not have even bothered. there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence, and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it (think ketchup as blood, and cabbages for severed heads). do not rent this!!

a majority of exclusively made-for-video low-budget fright flicks from the 80's invariably stink worse than raunchy old socks. this particularly dismal and amateurish no-budget chicago-set bargain basement "nasty necrophiliac nutcase on the loose" bloodbath serves as a depressing affirmation of this borderline ineluctable fact. a bearded, disheveled, long-haired, bead and flower shirt-wearing wild-eyed psycho hippie fruitcake embarks on your standard random gruesome killing spree, graphically slaughtering libidinous young couples who are engaging in strenuous coitus whenever the deranged mansonesque lunatic attacks. (hmm, do i detect a fairly obvious and self-righteously puritanical "have sex and die" message here? gee, could be, man.) boy, is this mentally unbalanced sicko one real way gone pup: after knifing his female victims, our certifiably crackers killer enjoys making love to their freshly slain bodies. (warning: possible *spoiler* ahead. towards the picture's end the corpse-copulating crazy gets rudely interrupted by the cops while he's in the middle of doing the unthinkable with a nubile cadaver, thereby provoking the foul pervert to cut loose with an understandably anguished and ear-splitting cry of "nooo!") now, ain't this gonzo guy a definite sweetheart and a half? too bad this flick is so poorly done; if it had only been made with a modicum of flair and proficiency it could have been a sleazy little gem of a horror exploitation item. alas, wally koz's ham-fisted direction, lamar "larry" bloodworth's stubbornly static and immobile cinematography, frankie "hollywood" rodriguez's insipid, monotonously head-banging "hard rock" score, the pitifully cheap and unconvincing make-up f/x, flat, conspicuously uneasy plywood acting by a hideously all-thumbs and unappealing non-pro cast, lethargic pacing (too much screen time is tiresomely squandered on the police's drab efforts to catch the wacko), an especially lame would-be shocking "surprise" ending (the mystery killer's true identity is guaranteed to have you groaning in disgust), the uniformly boring, incessantly bickering and positively braindead characters, and a steady succession of dull soft-core sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two slugs mate for 90 minutes straight all add up to one profoundly putrid and unrewarding limp, soggy noodle of a crummy clinker. however, to be fair, this film does possess one stellar virtue: the mad-dog slasher has unquestionably excellent taste in garishly tropical, louder-than-thunder day-glo hawaiian shirts.

well, i didn't know what to expect from 555. matter of fact, i had never even heard of it until a few months ago. but, being a collector of just about all types of horror i figured i would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. what the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. he decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death. after this, he proceeds to rape the dead corpse. the police think they have a lead on the killings but really have no idea what is going on. how will they find the killer? does anybody care?this movie is filled with some of the worst actors i have ever seen. no wonder none of these actors went on to do anything else, literally. the three lead actors consist of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. i am being sarcastic when i say sexy, she is about as un-sexy as it gets. the two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle dum. one of them underacts his part and the other one may have gone to the shatner school of acting. the acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie, thus almost putting you to sleep.the only thing holding this terrible movie together is a few decent gore scenes. for a movie on this budget the makers must have put all of there money into the special effects, which still aren't that great.unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie out there, i would suggest steering clear of this movie. 4/10

oh, the horror! i've seen a lot of gore movies in my day, but this one just makes me gag with with laughter rather than repulsiveness. this is definitely a crazy movie and is very low-budget, i might add, but if you're able to look past the cheap audio, horrible dialogue, ugly girls, the obviously fake gore scenes, and overall cheeziness of the film, then you might find some of this film to be somewhat entertaining. the story is about a copy cat killer who goes on a killing spree every "5th day, of the 5th month, of the 5th year" (wow, how original), and it's up to two detectives (one of whom gave a valiant effort at trying to make the crapy dialogue good) to stop the killer's bloody rampage. the killing scenes (which are done with a plastic toy knife) are pretty brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded scream (which is very ear piercing). as for the gore, there's plenty of it but it looks very fake; especially the blood - dude, c'mon, purple blood? but, if you're a fan of gore videos, like myself, then you'll find something in this video to cherish like i did (the crap-talking detective...he's the best thing going for this film). other than that, all you're going to find is a bunch of senseless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad the girls are ooogly) and a very idiotic hippy necrophiliac serial killer. sorry, but this one sucks.

well well, i had seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. but this flick is a tough one. and i mean it by all ways. it's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because mpaa was on the hunt for every copy on vhs, it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the mpaa. so copies disappeared into the underground scene. all people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. so it made this flick unique. vhs copies almost never pop up on ebay or other sites and if they do you will pay over a 100$ to get one. but due us connections i was able to catch a release on dvd sold worldwide. limited but it was to be a sort of official one. now and then there are still some screenings of this splatterfest. but is it worth all the hype surrounding it? as said earlier, it is a tough one to catch but also to sit through. there are gory killings, there is necrophilia, there is nudity but there is also a lot of talking between the coppers. and to be honest, if you would like to see the movie in 5 minutes watch the ending, it's a flashback in the killer's mind. the blood flows and indeed it's a splatterfest but not the full 80 minutes, splatter galore for 10 minutes. the quality of the movie is okay, sound okay, no hiss, colors okay, black is black and not blue as in many low budgets. it's okay to watch it but you never will be frightened but it's one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza i guess. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.

always enjoy the classic horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for john carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. this film was made during ww ii and john carradine was a german nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. bob steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film. mantan moreland, (jeff) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention. i hate to criticize a film made in 1943, but this is really a big disappointment. if you like john carradine and the roles he played as count dracula throughout many films during the 1940's, you just might like to watch john doing his best.

"revenge of the zombies" is a pretty weak and barely passable zombie effort.**spoilers**traveling in the bayou, larry adams, (robert lowery) and scott warrington, (mauritz hugo) are informed that a friend has deceased. meeting with local dr. von altermann, (john carradine) he repeats the notion that they mysteriously died. while they are staying there, they realize that the help consists of zombies, reanimated dead people who are doing the bidding of their master. as the bodies pile up, he reveals that he has been making the creatures for use in various experiments and all try to stop him before it's too late.the good news: this here gets very little right. the opening is easily it's best, as it's got several great marks for it. from where it starts, with the creepy silhouettes walking in the dark all the way through to the revelations, this one works wonders for both it's mystery and great imagery. the big one is a really scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long, slow and creepy shot. these here are all done before the opening credits and is a fun sight. the scenes in the middle where the creature reawakens inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great. the last big positive is the really fun ending. with the sort of ending that feels reminiscent of so many universal attempts, this one fits in with that style. from the creepy reanimation to the real action involved near the swamp, this one is fun and really works with the others to give it's only real positives.the bad news: this one here only has a couple flaws, but they are major ones. the first one is the film's major boredom from inactivity. almost nothing happens in here, mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than anything else. there's only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies, yet there's nothing here that devotes any action to the film. this one simply doesn't have any action, and that's what hurts the film. it rarely generates a scenes that keeps the interest going, and at times this makes it feel a lot longer than it really is. the last flaw in the film are it's pathetic excuses for zombies. those used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting any fear out of these creatures, and they really only serve several scenes. this here doesn't treat the zombies as threats, making them even less frightening. little screen-time, nonthreatening nature and un-modern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one. these here are what really hurt the film.the final verdict: with bad zombies and hardly anything worth watching, this one here is a curious effort. those used to modern zombies will find little of interest in this one and come out the same as this one is, while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shot.today's rating-pg: mild violence

there is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies (i may get to watch another one, revolt of the zombies [1936], before the month is out). for all star john carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the third reich with them, they are not seen to do much at all!; james baskett (uncle remus from song of the south [1946]!) plays their leader, who also serves as carradine's manservant. black comic mantan moreland reprises his 'fraidy cat' chauffeur role from king of the zombies (1941), as does the exotically named madame sul-te-wan as carradine's housekeeper. unfortunately for carradine, his supreme achievement  the zombification of his wife  brings him all sorts of trouble: not only do her relatives turn up at his remote abode/lab to inquire into her sudden death (which means he has to fake a funeral service!) but she actually proves disobedient and indignant, eventually 'persuading' her fellow zombies to rise against their master!! also involved is cowboy star bob steele (still best-known for his bit in howard hawks' the big sleep [1946]) who plays a u.s. secret agent posing as a nazi posing as a sheriff! thankfully, director sekely would have much better luck with his next genre effort, the day of the triffids (1962).

one of low budget horror schlockmeister actor, john carradine's more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the reich. mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in mcdonalds.hitler isn't mentioned by name, since america wasn't at war at the time they was filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!there seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black & white films of the 1930's and '40's. blank eyed and just following the commands of someone else as they stumble along. and then there is the type we know from later films like 'the night of the living dead' and 'the evil dead.' still roaming about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims. both have their moments in various movies over the years. 'revenge' features the former zombie type, although, these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as geeks as they bite the heads off chickens. one black zombie named lazarus with his wild hair, looks like a young don king.as to the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake. even though he lets her keep her strappy heels as a nice womanly touch as he turns her into one of the living dead, she's not happy about it.it all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the tale must be, never, ever, turn your wife into a zombie, it's just asking for trouble....the film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish, but never rises above it's poverty row origins. not a patch on any true zombie classics but fun just the same.

i watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time. the girl from emmerdale she was fat so yeah she should be in fat friend but no one every lost weigh.like itv made a big mistake with this.bad girls is 100times better.i feel that the whole show was just about large people trying to loose weight but never did then they tried to have love storyline oh my god what a a waste of time and also air time. this show has not been repeated on itv2/3/4 yeah thats how good it is.i would say do not by th box sets just a waste of money.beware

this movie was terrible. the acting was awful. the script was awful. what was even worse were the camera shots and sound. half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. the worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. the building had to have been 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. however, when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had "recreated" the top of the building. the building's width had been reduced to about eight feet wide. how could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide? i know the film was low budget, but it is inexcusable. the movie itself just pushed ideas about a "rapture" then actually having a storyline or point. this reduced the script to mere rubbish, the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the movie along in a direction. it was a complete waste of time watching. the movie gives christians a bad name if it is one of the current best christian films out there.

the back of the dvd for this movie raves, "chey is the quentin tarantino of christian films." this isn't so much an insult to quentin as it is to christian films. this film is poorly written, stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. the scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. flashbacks, fades to grey, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility. the camera is haphazard, some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no significance. poor blocking and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to who in many scenes. oh and the audio is terrible. the special effects were decent and thankfully limited. but this is all just technical. the movie fails to engage on an emotional level. the dialogue is so fake sounding and the actors seem to have only read it a moment before the camera was rolling. the story... the things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them. the characters are struggling to take hold of one dimensionality. and the characters have to make a stance on christianity and faith in every single scene. take a queue from m. night, engaging christian films don't have to have the characters saying the name of jesus christ in every scene for the movie to be christian. goodness! please don't try to show this to your unsaved friends with any expectations other than laughter.

this movie was terrible. you couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. it came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and i literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. it was one of the worst movies i have ever experienced. worse than all dean cain films combined. to start, the acting was terrible. i realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any tv experience would have given them a little more talent. the movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality. in the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.

the other reviewer was completely correct about this one. the writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. the actors looked like they were not really into the movie, like they almost *had* to be there. there were some unique camera effects, but they were not really germane to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. i suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can i say that?) of the other eschatologically influenced movies (omega code, left behind). and yes, it does make christians embarrassed when these types of movies are produced. i would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially a non-christian.

ok i watched this movie. someone needs to kick me. why must the olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this putrid torture? this was another movie of watching the olsen twins travel to an exotic location, meet some cute guys,look pretty and have everyone drooling over them.the direction,the plot development,ugh the acting. i don't know about the u.s., but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to hop onto the bike of a guy u met like,10 minutes back. though i'm now convinced that these girls will never learn to act, i really hope that one day we'll get to watch a movie with an original,even slightly plausible plot.

the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, producing studios, and not smell this bomb from far away? in order to gain some sort of responsibility, which i dont really see the sense in the punishment..., they are sent to paris, far far far away from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris. i cant really remember what he was, so who really cares? the detail doesnt help, the girls are sent to paris to learn something.. so what exactly do they learn when they meet two french boys and are able to manipulate the guy that supposed to watch them so they can meet these guys on scooters? the typical pre-teen movie, having all pre-teens wishing to misbehave and be able to afford the trip to paris or some far away country away from parents? i dont really like the olsens anyways, they never could really shake off the image of michelle, on full house... in case you didnt see that, then you were lucky from the start. (f f-)

a stupid movie, with a stupid plot. feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender. i especially "liked" the part, where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water. because we all know how dedicated america is to conservation of the environment. kyoto, anyone?? and the french chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger... this is why people think americans have no culture. that, and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to europe to "see the world" (i.e. eat at mcdonalds in foreign capitals) they are not as dumb as the two ditsy preteens in this movie, but they have just about the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners.

i was once a big olsen fan. i received this movie when i was six and watched it almost nonstop until i was nine. then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. i was left speechless.mary-kate and ashley play allie and mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend spring break in paris with their ambassador grandfather. along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute french boys who show them the more fun side to paris. i guess the two boys were okay, fake french accents aside. the plot is predictable and the humour is shallow and corny. mary-kate and ashley play two shallow girls with too much make up on their face. don't watch this movie if you're not into the olsen twins or family movies.

this movie was alright. mary-kate and ashley play twin sisters (sorry for stating the obvious) who against their will are sent to paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that.right away two french boys (who looked slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. blah blah blah. it's an olsen twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. anyway, along with that, the twins meet a fabulous french model because they're in paris, the fashion capital of the world. they make bffs with the model and spend a fun montage of shopping in the city of lights. yep.plotwise, i frankly can't remember what happened. i guess that could say something, but hey, it's an olsen movie. "olsen movie" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment".overall, this movie was annoying. i mean, can i really identify at all with two girls who are devastated upon hearing that they're going to paris? really? also, the jokes really weren't that funny. however, i watched the whole movie. so it had to be somewhat entertaining. the fact that it was set in paris was what probably kept me watching.

i have seen this movie and i did not care for this movie anyhow. i would not think about going to paris because i do not like this country and its national capital. i do not like to learn french anyhow because i do not understand their language. why would i go to france when i rather go to germany or the united kingdom? germany and the united kingdom are the nations i tolerate. apparently the olsen twins do not understand the french language just like me. therefore i will not bother the france trip no matter what. i might as well stick to the united kingdom and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade. that is all.

one of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. a red-shirt female falls for khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring. we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "wink of an eye", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! same as in ss. (however, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.) this is very silly because it once again makes kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress morons, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. the fact that mcgivers switches back to kirk's side doesn't ameliorate the illogic in any way. lord mcgiveth and the lord mctaketh...why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength? that's one of several st plot-devices that undermine kirk's intelligence. why does khan hold a knife against mccoy's throat? if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself. and what's with a sikh being played with a latino accent? montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach. i was half-expecting to hear "the plaaain! the plaaaain!" in the background at any moment. why the hell would kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone? is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? ss is a very cartoonish, silly episode, so no wonder trekkies love it. it doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what trekkies hate the most. it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny trekkie brain.

i saw this at my in-laws' house one night when it popped up on tv and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. well, she can have it.look, i can enjoy a chick flick now and then, as long as it's good. but this one's extra-sappy, unrealistic, and just plain predictable, despite some decent performances from rock hudson and jane wyman. it's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her. oh well, they say love is blind...the neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag, too. and how often did we need otto kruger repeating the title? it happened not once, not twice, but three times!

daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright. except in this case it doesn't. based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas, (he wrote "the robe"), and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight. to make amends he takes up medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (no, it sin't quite that daft; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). in between times, they fall in love.try as i might i can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirk's films, (this one isn't too deep). on the plus side rock hudson isn't half bad, (i think i am rediscovering him), and, of course, it looks great, (in sirk's films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals). nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap-opera terms this is definitely daytime tv.

i would like to know the real name of the lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. it is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the hotel del coronado. i know it was on either big bear lake or lake arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. as for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that jane wyman was even nominated for an academy award. this must have been a period when she was well liked by her academy peers. it really would have been interesting to get a true impression from wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script. the script of this movie, like the recent kevin costner movie with a message in a bottle, is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts. rock hudson can be forgiven. he was never a great actor, was able to get by mostly on his looks and didn't get credible roles until later in his career (pretty maids is the exception). but wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system.

well, that was sure a waste of dave mckean's talents, wasn't it? don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, dave mckean may be the best in the world right now. the layered, textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like peter greenaway and david fincher look like what they are: hackwork. mckean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, film, even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered.but this movie? it's junk. complete junk. the story, from neil gaiman, is, unfortunately, exactly what gaiman has been giving us ever since he ripped off clive barker for the first time: a pseudo-mythic, overblown dreamscape, populated by characters which have titles in all capital letters rather than names. everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotion, or empathy from anyone involved. people make pithy postulations, speaking in riddles which bring to mind what rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead might have sounded like if tom stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke halfway through its composition. really, gaiman, get over yourself. you're not a prophet. you're a poser.mckean's directing doesn't help - his pacing is poor, taking fully half an hour to actually rev himself up for the main picaresque plot, and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events, none of them given any weight. the monsters don't menace because they're not foreshadowed, simply thrown at the screen. the plot doesn't engage because we don't really care about the rancid little protagonists. half the dialogue, muttered into into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks, is unintelligible.some of the visuals are pretty, and i'm sure the fanboys will lick it up. pity. think of the amount of really good work mckean could have produced if he hadn't been stuck with this lame project.grade: d/d-

wow, what exciting visual effects. i also loved the costumes and artwork, the circus and ethereal feel to the film was sublime. it just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. as she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of peril unlike, say, david lynch's films which haunt every time. this also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at. who would this engage?mirrormask is obviously going to draw comparisons with labyrinth with the teen- angst/ fantasy theme, but unfortunately it doesn't really come close to delivering the same henson essence. the ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up the eye candy.not agonisingly awful a la the cell, nor as engagingly dreamlike as labyrinth - a forgettable but good-looking fantasy.

this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen. i would think you could get that from the title. also, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film. i can't even remember why i saw this film or when. only that is an absolutely horrible movie-viewing experience. on the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then by all means rent it. good luck finding it at your local store though. i doubt this movie is in a very wide-distribution. and please do not show this to children by any means as it may warp their impressionable minds forever.

this is one odd film. it seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual innuendos. the whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting, but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched, but then again, the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line.the cast are good though, meg foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader, with the handsome a.j. damato as the leader of the bullies. aerky egan and rebecca herbst are well cast as the young lovers, though for a comic actress of her talent, leigh allyn baker is notoriously wasted in this film.overall, the film is unusual, but i don't think that is enough to make up for the poor quality and bumbling execution. the scenery is all rather dull and the "special effects" quite dismal. sit this one out, unless your in the mood.

apparently shrunken heads was the last movie that julius harris had a role in. i have not seen all of his movies, but julius harris was in many good movies, and i remember him best from "live and let die" where he played tee-hee and which was full of voodoo references, something that is common here in south florida! i always thought live and let die was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 movies. in shrunken heads, julius harris is back in his voodoo persona! he has a great style for mystery and the occult, and his part in this movie is excellent. sadly, the rest of the movie is something of a comedy. spoilers: three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of the little rascals get killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he got fired from the cast of fame! or as a dancer on dick clark's american bandstand. in other words, these kids give low budget another dimension. julius harris goes to the mortuary-funeral home, cuts off the three kids' heads (and nobody notices) and then takes them to his condominium unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids. the three heads get tossed in, along with some herbs, spices, and voodoo items. at some point mr. harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them, and they come to life as talking heads! they can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes, and exact vengeance from the evil-doers. they usually look pretty funny flying around, but the effects are not bad. for some reason, one of the kids always has a switch-blade in his mouth, and he uses it to slice people's necks and to cut holes into tires. this movie is weird and funny, but only the first time you see it. meg foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than rosie o'donnell and meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangsters. strange movie.

it's impossible to make a film based on such a book as the "brothers karamzov" by f.m. dostojevsky.richard brooks is a great director, but that film is on a very low level.the worst part of the film was the ending. well, let's think of the book. in the end we have the "guilty" dimitrij karamazov. afterwards they sent him to siberia. in the end, the famous epilogues of dostojevsky, the friends and family making a plan to save him. but that's it ... a nd now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of dimitry and gruschenka(i think). just from the moral point i'm sure that dostojevsky would finish the book with an open end because one the one hand he is not guilty(smerdjakov is the real murderer) and so he have to be a free man. but on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him, so he has decided to commit the crime... that's a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open end...well, for real ,it's just not full open.william shatner as aljoscha karamazov... i'm sorry! --> no!!!the others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great actors ... in front of course a superb performance of yul breynner as dimitrij. i think that there are not many actors who can play this part in a better way.but as i said in the beginning: this book is unadaptable. it never should be film in two hours that's impossible. i think that there are some 'longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing... but i just keep the opinion that this book can't be adapted.so - 3 points:a point for the great director richard brooks a point for a superb performance of yul brynnerfinally: a point for one of the greatest writers of all time: dostojevsky

hilariously inept - like "she wore a yellow ribbon" remade by five-year-olds.spoilers ahead: despite its title, and the high bodycount, "slaughter trail" is in fact a musical with injun battles instead of dance numbers.if you ever wondered what ed wood might have done with a b-movie budget, this film should answer your question. some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as filming in the short-lived cinecolor process, which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot. but there was definitely some ill-advised skimping on the film's main set, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a norman castle.terry gilkyson, who later wrote the 'the bare necessities' for disney's "the jungle book", supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. one song tells how "horse hooves pound, and their melody sounds, like the hoofbeat serenade"...during a dead-serious scene of a cavalry patrol. other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot, introducing characters, describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on screen - and even stop to advertise the cinecolor process(!) the script sends ferocious navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio. by the end of the film, what looks like a hundred navajos and cavalrymen have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over.) but the chief is satisfied once he sees the trio of badguys have been slain. as the singer helpfully informs those of us who weren't paying attention, the navajos ride away, their battle called off. the cavalry captain, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, cheerily waves his appreciation.the direction could most charitably be described as wooden, or more to the point, wood-en. navajos are consistently shot off their horses in pairs -- never just one. virtually every red man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and keeling over. the film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in hollywood, who crouch before dropping off a one-story roof (and still fail to stick the landing) or turn to look behind them as they slide, "dead", down a rocky slope.the star is brian donlevy, who surely deserves an oscar for not blushing. after the endless final battle scene -- "climax" is scarcely the word -- he scans a list of the dozens of his troopers killed, and shrugs, "it could've been a lot worse." trooper andy devine gets to sing and robber/murderer gig young laughs at andy's antics...which leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to rat gig out: "i'd know that laugh anywhere!" and lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work howard hughes could be, recall that as head of rko, hughes was first in line to blacklist original star howard da silva when huac denounced him. it would take hughes another six years to finish running that once-celebrated studio into the ground, but it didn't help things when he insisted on reshooting da silva's every scene for this film, substituting donlevy.it was nearly a decade before da silva was able to work in hollywood again. but all things considered, for getting him out of "slaughter trail", he should have sent hughes a thank-you note.

anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say "fake". "it's never been disproved" also is a weak argument. saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in zambia. no bones of any primates are have been found in the united states or canada. there is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this. the same argument goes for the loch ness monster, ghosts and god.

i saw this movie years about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories that i have about it are : 1. that it was awful. 2. that in one scene linnea quigley applies suntan lotion to her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes straight (it seemed that long anyways). 3. one scene where a character gets a sledgehammer rammed into his head. in this scene, when the hammer connects, the head smashes like glass. it's quite bad.

here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end. did the director decide to become auteur suddenly, 80% through the making of this movie? yeesh. spoiler alert thing start out typically enough for 50's youth-gone-wild; there are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the kindly old diner manager, and the town creep. things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only likable character is killed off and the anti-hero is blamed (this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie... but all this stuff starts happening and unravelling during the final reel! major curve ball). then things get weird; the kindly old codger forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody pulp. the mere presence of the hero's friend somehow drags a confession out of the real killer - the leering, creepy town nut (which in any real universe, he'd have been the prime suspect to begin with, even if the anti-hero was found with her body).we're left with a somewhat feeble "happy" ending, which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes preceding it.even more odd is this film's insistence on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt, but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight. maybe this was on purpose - perhaps bix's resistance to settling down with the girl was more because of his sexuality (which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed, and thus not discussed or even admitted by him) than his need to be a "drifter". if the director's intent was to spin this as a sexual yarn - that the drifter drifts because he feels he's an outcast sexually; that his paternal regard towards danny is not, in fact, paternal but spousal; that his inability to remain with carrie is rooted in a sexual revulsion that even he does not quite understand - it could have been made more clear. instead, we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoeroticism and behavior that is completely heterosexual.these young men sleep next to each other even when they can get some room to spread out. when danny is propositioned (and once even in bed with a woman), bix flips out and takes him away. danny pays bix's way (sure, there is another explanation for it, but it still strikes a chord every time you see danny buy bix's lunch). they end up living together at the end. not since hitchcock's "rope" has homosexuality been so blatant but denied.mst3k did the right thing by taking this one on. aside from jack elam, there is little to commend the film.

it is a shame that a movie with such a good cinematography as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of sarah cawley (cinematography) and adam lichtenstein (film editing), and above all, no sense of what goes on in mexico city. the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city, but it is unable to do it. it is a shame, a lot of film wasted. an american woman tries to find her brother who has been kidnaped. the first account of the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems that there was no effort to come with a better narrative of the ordeal, especially when it comes to the issue of the attitudes of the us embassy personnel in mexico city, when dealing with an issue like this one. compare, as an example, with frantic(1988), which deals with a similar issue. something similar can be said of the role of local authorities. compare, as an example, with todo el poder (1999). the movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the looks of the city itself, paying little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many twists that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief. who is going to believe that a mexican patrol from mexico city is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the mexico-us border? and that this policeman is going to be able to use its radio from the border to mexico city! only the producers of this movie. it is worth mentioning that unlike frida and other movies about mexico at least in these one mexicans talk spanish.

"nicodemus" is almost a copy of "red" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in clark kent's unpredictable life. when a poisonous flower finds it's way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is lana. the episode was good up to that point, for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark. at the last moment, he refuses her but the damage has already been done. this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn't suitable for people under the age of twenty, due to it's adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect the flower has on pete) was good, but the middle that was all about lana's alternate personality, was most defiantly not, and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode. i give this episode two.
