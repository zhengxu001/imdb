as a professional poker dealer for over 25 years i found this movie very hard to watch. too unreal. it seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care. the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game. common sense right? plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks. who couldn't do that? the cheating was amateur stuff. palming, marked cards, etc. would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards? would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet? c'mon ! i gave it a 4 because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful. next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right. ouch!!!

perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane austen's works has been portrayed. perhaps i am too severe on this adaptation, but i'm afraid i am biased to the a&e version. i have a hard time imagining mr. darcy portrayed by anyone other than colin firth.the characters seemed shallow, and often dialogue forced. lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. her fancy for wickham was overplayed, and then her sudden like for darcy was not believable.darcy was portrayed tolerably well, i will grant him. he managed to maintain the aloofness that is required, but i felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful, especially in the proposal scene.mr. and mrs. bennet were also played well, but seemed lacking in many ways. the mean temper of mrs. bennet was not completely captured in her performance.mr. collins' was a good portrayal. very much in line with the book.i will refrain from commenting on lady catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire film.other problems i saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as darcy being present at the first meeting with lady c., and also that miss lucas and sir william did not join lizzy on her visit to the collins'.the choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes. the scene where lizzy and darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor. at least this bbc version left out the dialogue between lizzy, darcy and sir william when he commends the two on their dancing, as they performed very ill indeed.there were occasional moments that it kept me interested, but overall i find this version to be a disappointment. i would not advise this film unless you're like me, and you are excessively diverted by such follies.

i have been an avid jane austen fan for many years. i had never seen this adaptation, so when i had heard of it, i came here and read all the excellent reviews. on that basis i eagerly ordered it from netflix. what a cruel disappointment! they have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. although this adaptation seems to have used every word that jane austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion. even though it was done as a miniseries, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as rushed as if it had been done as a movie of the week.mr. bennett too harsh, mrs. bennet just a chattering chipmunk, mr. darcy as lifeless as a nutcracker, the bennett girls almost indistinguishable and mr. wickham a man who no one would look twice at - hardly the appealing cad! i'm quite put out!

if you want to truly experience the magic (?) of don dohler, then check out "alien factor" or maybe "fiend", but not this. alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy, but "nightbeast", which i guess is sort of an updating of alien factor, is just plain dumb. actors sleepwalk through their roles, especially mr. monotone sheriff, and the monster is some dumb halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from alien factor. a spaceship crashes on earth and there's a critter inside, of course, who runs around vaporizing people. and ripping off arms, etc. and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too, until it gets shot out of his hand. and that's really about it. "alien factor" beats this mess hands down, if you really want to see a good don dohler movie, check that out instead. and rip don dohler, 12/2/06.

ok, when i say "wow," i mean, "jesus, please help me." i have an old vhs copy that was printed before troma got a copy of the title. the movie is about an alien crash landing on earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion. watch out!!! and by that, i mean watch out for those special effects. there is an amazing number of mistakes. the acting is terrible, but i'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the sheriff. the film itself is really grainy and poorly lighted. in one particular scene, it is day outside and then the shot shows the night beast shooting his gun with night behind him. then it shows day again. *shakes head* i usually like low-budget horror films, but i had to force myself to finish it because i never watch a movie without finishing it. the only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that wasn't stereotypical. so for that, and only for that... i give it a 3 out of 10.don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day. you'll be even more depressed at the failed attempt this movie makes.

after the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh ok i'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. a terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. three nearby campers investigate. from the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the 'nightbeast' emerges, ok so i lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. the campers are quickly killed by the nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people. the towns sheriff jack cinder (tom griffith) is informed. he alerts his deputy lisa kent (karin kardian) and gathers a posse of men together to investigate. meanwhile the nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. his two annoying kids run for help. they approach a house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says "someones running towards the house". the guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the nightbeast, it kills the girl as well. then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser, maybe the nightbeast ain't so bad after all. once the sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun/laser battle with the nightbeast. after possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the sheriff, his deputy and a local man jamie lambert (jamie zemarel) survive. but the nightbeast is still alive, bullets seem to have no effect on it. the next day the sheriff visits the towns mayor, bert wicker (richard dyszel) and his girlfriend mary jane (eleanor herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town. he refuses saying a party he is holding for the governor (richard ruxton) cannot be cancelled, and that he doesn't want to create a panic situation. the sheriff evacuates the town anyway. two doctors, steven price (george stover) and ruth sherman (anne firth) are attacked by the nightbeast before they can leave. however, they manage to scare the nightbeast away and survive. together with the sheriff his deputy and jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. written and directed by don dohler this has to be an amateur film, made with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many dohler's are involved. for that reason i should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn't stop it, or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department. it has no story or purpose, things just happen to waste time, whats with drago (don leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend suzie (monica neff)? this and many more scenes add nothing to the film. the script has no logic either, why does the nightbeast stick around the town once it's been supposedly evacuated? the special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when the nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect an 80's spectrum would be ashamed of. there's not really much blood or gore in it, a ripped open stomach, a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor. credit where it's due, the nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part. there's a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed, music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch. less than stellar acting, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through. and the worse thing about this film? it commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest. sorry don mate, but don't give up the day job! definitely one to avoid.

an hulking alien beastie crash-lands on earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off (that is when his aim isn't terribly off) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen! all in all, it's pretty silly stuff. i do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times. i actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects. however it doesn't help when the monster provides the movie's only truly entertaining moments and he isn't on screen for a large portion of the film's running time. the acting throughout this is just plain awful and amateurish and our lead hero sheriff cinder is much too unattractive to be bagging the film's hottest chick. i also have to take off points for blatantly copying the thing from another world (1951) on several occasions. when the monster isn't on a rampage, nightbeast is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun. watch this one back to back with the 1951 thing and see the difference characterization, attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the loose movie.

from hardly alien sounding lasers, to an elementary school style shuttle crash, "nightbeast" is better classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest. the almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story. the acting however is not nearly as beastly, many of the young, aspiring, actors admirably showcase a hidden talent. particularly don leifert and jamie zemarel, who shed a well needed shard of light on this otherwise terrible film. nightbeast would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small maryland town.

i was more entertained by watching my wife almost pull her hair out in frustration through most of this movie. i thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the dairy barn any minute. so i cheated, grabbed the remote, and was relieved to find out it was ending in merely 20 minutes. i should have turned the channel. cute, it had potential, but yuck!

it is terrible! it is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. the story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. i don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. the acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful. the only scene i didn't hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film. how do people get finance for this stuff? i don't mind alternative films but shouldn't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure? i would call 'price of milk' amateurish if it wasn't an insult to amateurs. this would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged!

this movie is somehow showing 6.2 stars, it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations. i am at a loss to explain this.avoid this movie at all costs. you have only a certain number of hours on the earth, don't waste 1&1/2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano!!!there is no story as apparently the director "wrote" (and i'm guessing with a blunt orange crayon) the next day's script at the completion of the day's shooting. the "story" has been called whimsical, no it is aimless, there is maybe enough "story" to fill a commercial. don't you hate ads?now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here. and similarly the writer/director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work "toy love" so to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you're paid to watch it avoid it.to paraphrase monty python's search for the holy grail, "run flee!"

this movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on-screen, and issuing a gravelly "haaaa" at every scene involving a computer or mobile device).for everyone else, it's a mean-spirited, bungled "comedy." the movie strictly follows the formula of the later "scary movie" films, as well as "epic movie" and "meet the spartans," though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating. still, the lampooning of intellectual and peacemaking figures the world over makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy brainpower. "superhero movie" is particularly and consistently nasty to stephen hawking, introducing him as a sex-starved druggie and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick.the plot is based on "spider-man," with "batman begins" and "x-men" thrown in just to deliver some physical comedy. much of the movie is slapstick, but not in any invigorating or interesting way. the longest-running gag is a fart joke, and early on the scriptwriters seem to believe that having the main character get thrown in conspicuous piles of fake animal poo automatically enlivens an otherwise uninspired rehash of the spider bite scene from "spider-man." perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is the energy in it, notably absent in other recent parodies. the filmmakers act as though they're doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce around the screen. an extremely abbreviated length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the zest of the presentation makes "superhero movie" tolerable rather than horrifying.

went with some friends and one of my friends mom, thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break, but the movie turned out awful. we all agree it shouldn't have been pg-13. more like r material. lots of sexual dialog, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (below the waist). not worth the time or money. strongly urge you not to go, or rent it when it comes out. if you do end up going, don't take smaller children. not the type of movie to see with the family! if curious about the content, check out the content advisory section on the superhero movie page on imdb. most of the content that was meant to be funny was extremely crude. especially when they make fun of steven hawking.

i thought this would be funny. i did. i don't know what happened. but i think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting. i don't know who this kid is, he could be a very nice person but he wasn't right for this movie. and the supporting cast was great which only makes it more obvious. for example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then keith david starts speaking, or leslie nielsen, or marion ross, and it's like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad. but when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again. the spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this thing. i mean it had a couple of funny bits, as i do remember laughing a couple of times, but right now i don't remember why and it was only a few days ago.really i'm giving it a take it or leave it rating but i think most people should just leave it.

and so it started with "shreik" a send up of horror films, then we had scary movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however....now we have: scary movie* scary movie 2 scary movie 3 scary movie 4* date movie meet the spartans not another team movie* plus many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *)and.....super hero movie.... it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send-ups funny. using the rip-offs from other movies in a funny way is all well and good if done properly, but not many producers seem to know how to do that. scary movie(1) did it well, the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise, but it was redeemed by scary movie 4. not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well...and to its credit i am sick of teen movies. however, this movie plays like a bad version of all of these. it relies on slap stick the would make even the 3 stooges cringe, violating the image of stephen hawking, and then when people begin to get bored (and the producers knew when this would be) we are treated to pamela anderson in a skin tight suit. to conclude, spoofs should be about making a homage-like mock-up of an original movie with an original storyline, not plastering random take offs of legitimate film onto the storyline of a real film. ...i shudder at the thought of "sci-fi movie" and get my seppuku knife ready

this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen in my life. it is a complete waste of money and time. i went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater- not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie- said "wow what a good movie." someone actually walked out! it was absolutely terrible! it was disgusting and i hated every minute of it. my friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with rick on the ceiling peeing, she had had enough. it was not funny at all. believe me i went with 11 other girls and not one of my friends liked it. it was ridiculous! i've seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst! i mean a scene in the movie is with an old man making out with a dead person in a coffin. i just can't make up these things.

i took my 14 year old to see this movie. we left after 15 or 20 minutes. it was absolutely awful! this movie should be rated r at the least. i am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. it was a waste of money. i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was way beyond crude. i was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was. i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content. i don't understand how the rating system works.??

this film was the worst film i have ever seen. it was a complete waste of money. if i had not been in the cinema was my two young cousins (who also thought it was disappointing, but not as terrible as i thought), i would have left the cinema. there were two points in the film that i almost laughed, but the rest of it was either boring, ridiculous or painful. i thought it would be a spoof on all superhero movies (which i love), but in fact it was mainly based on spiderman, with a few oblique references to other superhero movies such as fantastic four and batman. i really cannot think of one good thing to say about this film. do not waste your money with this film-there are many other better films out there!

i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. i'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me. i couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. it was crude and offensive. i was totally misled by its pg-13 rating and the previews that i had seen for it. i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon, and i thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe i just don't remember the preview correctly) . plus, drake bell (the movie's main character) stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers. i really didn't think that the movie's content would be as risky as it was. i should have done more research about it before i went. however, i'm hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it.seriously, do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie. the rating should have been r. there are tons of sexual references, drug references, and disturbing events throughout the movie. examples: drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes that involve men grabbing women's breasts, lots of profanity, drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting (or something like that), people get stabbed, hit, and hurt in the movie, and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded. there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. it was really demeaning to women in general. the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series, so that should tell you something right there. please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex, drugs, and violence. most children and teenagers can't decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality.i do have a sense of humor. i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre. but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying.as for the overall quality of the movie, i didn't think it was that original or funny. it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful. the acting wasn't too bad, considering how bad the script was. if you're an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie, skip this one or rent it.

scary movie 1-4, epic movie, date movie, meet the spartans, not another teen movie and another gay movie. making "superhero movie" the eleventh in a series that single handily ruined the parody genre. now i'll admit it i have a soft spot for classics such as airplane and the naked gun but you know you've milked a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off. in fact the only thing that might really temp you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell-out leslie neilson.you can tell he needs the money, wither that or he intends to go down with the ship like a good capitan would. in no way is he bringing down this genre but hell he's not helping it. but if i feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor drake bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment. the people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of laughless bile no funnier than herpes.after spoofing disaster films in airplane!, police shows in the naked gun, and hollywood horrors in scary movie 3 and 4, producer david zucker sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy lampooning everything from spider-man to x-men and superman returns.shortly after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly, high-school outcast rick riker (drake bell) begins to experience a startling transformation. now rick's skin is as strong as steel, and he possesses the strength of ten men. determined to use his newfound powers to fight crime, rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of the dragonfly -- a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law-abiding citizens.but every superhero needs a nemesis, and after lou landers (christopher mcdonald) is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry, he develops the power to leech the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous hourglass. intent on achieving immortality, the hourglass attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble dragonfly sets out to take down his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero. craig mazin writes and directs this low-flying spoof.featuring tracy morgan, pamela anderson, leslie nielsen, marion ross, jeffrey tambor, and regina hall.hell superhero movie may earn some merit in the fact that it's a hell of a lot better than meet the spartans and epic movie. but with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date. laughless but a little less irritating than meet the spartans. and in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the spartans. but maybe that's a good reason. there are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that was meet the spartans from our memory.my final verdict? avoid, unless you're one of thoses people who enjoy such car crash cinema. as bad as date movie and scary movie 2 but not quite as bad as meet the spartans or epic movie. super villain.

i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie, that was humorous, however my expectations were let down. this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg-13 movie, this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie. i wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this.even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie, beware of a truly stupid movie, there's no humor in the movie, just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia, something that shouldn't even be joked about. i would like to know what happened to pg-13 movies, that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old? this is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re-rated.

here's a spoof that's guaranteed to entertain folks in the iq range of homer simpson. it's a cheap shot at every great superhero, notably spiderman and batman. but it doesn't end there; it gets progressively worse until it disintegrates into a pathetic ensemble of slapstick trollop by the truckload.for those interested in the plot, you've only to watch spiderman while under the influence of some heavy narcotic. what you get is dragonfly man  a boy wonder, who loves the girl next door, suddenly inheriting some stupendous super-powers.the rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but don't' take my word for it! for kids, this is somewhat amusing; for adults it's a great film to drop the kids off for.

superhero movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over "parody" movie movies which i despise so much. i wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but i know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go, than superhero movie is probably near the top. unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.superhero movie has a decent cast of c-list celebs. it's got drake bell (the kid from disney's drake and josh), leslie nielson (airplane!), tracy morgan (snl and 30 rock), and a few others scattered throughout. although it has the star power to light a 40-watt bulb, the movie fails to utilize any humor.this movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot, and not one single joke is funny. i didn't laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time.don't see this movie. don't even think about it. for the love of cinema, just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one....oh, who am i kidding? they'll probably come out with another one by fall.

the movie starts with a spiderman spoof which is your introduction to rick riker (played by drake bell of "drake & josh" fame, personally i'd have given the movie to josh who is much funnier) and the "rick punchers" joke is lifted right out of airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. rick's class is on a science trip to the amalgamated genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, brent spiner (data in star trek tng) playing dr strom. rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come from.we meet our next big star names at rick's home, his aunt lucille (marion ross of happy days fame) & uncle albert (leslie nielson of airplane, police squad & naked gun fame). and we're introduced to carlson on the amalgamated board of directors (dan castellaneta from the simpsons) who is then very promptly killed. we're told rick has slept for 5 days & get some cheap, crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention. the stephen hawking lookalike's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't remotely funny.we get another spiderman spoof (rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end right there as jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead. you get to see rick's 1st powers emerge (gripping ability & speed) then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong. we also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed. we get a flashback and a batman spoof in which we discover rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. spoofing spiderman again ricks uncle is shot with jeffrey tambor (from hellboy) playing the hospital doctor. we then get an x-men spoof (done very badly as patrick stewart is about as white as they come), barry bonds is played by yet another lookalike.we meet invisible girl (played by pamela anderson looking stunning in her costume!). ricks 1st outing in his costume (once he fixes his ability to see & breath through it) is another batman spoof. the tom cruise youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike (and not a very good one at that). there are lots of modern references like youtube, facebook & wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day. there's a very weak gay joke (never a good idea to do those either) when jill is helping aunt lucille make thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene isn't very funny, just infantile.the aunt farting scene isn't particularly funny, just incredibly childish. anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12. she's killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke (is there no topic these people won't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of?) at her funeral, and the even worse cremation joke.we get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie (prince charles & nelson mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you didn't already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is landers wins the "douchebag of the year" award. landers is revealed as the hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past jill twice in the same direction).obviously the hourglass is foiled, jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one.

it's not fair. i was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. i mean, i like drake bell from drake and josh, and leslie neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, airplane and the naked gun. however, after seeing superhero movie, i'm glad i didn't even have to pay for it. it just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. more like a dollar and a few pennies. because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes. and as disappointing as this film was i'm glad the running time was that short, if not shorter. i just cant believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary, and above all, stupid, some of the scenes were! and above that, i've seen better acting from a wooden dummy(without the ventriloquist). it's as if craig mazin purposefully wanted to make a film that deserves its 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than "meet the spartans". very disappointing indeed.

when a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero dragonfly...superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. sadly however, despite the presence of david zucker (who was involved with airplane!, top secret and the naked gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! the fault mainly lies with the gags. it's simply not funny enough. some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. the x-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. blazing saddles this isn't! one of the key things about the best spoof movies, like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. this makes it even funnier. even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. again funny. the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, then try and spoof them. as a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! the cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.as recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as epic movie, date movie, or the awful meet the spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.

sometimes you get exactly what you expect. a film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit- and in this case it certainly doesn't. in fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself, which like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs, and over-the-top antics, but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun. utilizing a script by carl dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe, and wasting the talents of edward furlong, the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music, most notably the elaborate recreating of a 1978 kiss concert.

in bollywood it isn't rare that worthless films become hits, good films flopping and good actors not making it bigaks is such a moviehimesh after a music director and singer tried acting hell man, just because his songs became a hit that means next he becomes an actorthe producers were sure the film will work perhaps, the songs were a hit too and of course himesh did his cheap publicity as usualthe film tells such a poor story, such poor direction, such poor acting it makes you cringeindian rickshaws in germany, stunts by himesh and lot of stupidity himesh's cap is intact even when he is in the car which somersaultsdirection is poor music is saving grace though most songs sound the samehimesh tries hard but sadly his emotive scenes are a joke, lacks expressions, he is best suited for his music director and some singing he cuts a sorry picture hansika is awful malika is okay sachin khedekar is okay, darshan jhariwala hams

agreed this movie is well shot,but it just makes no sense and no use as to how they made 2 hours seem like 3 just over a small love story,this could have been an episode of the bold and the beautiful or the o.c,in short please don't watch this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you up from you're sleep,i gave this movie 1/10 cause that was the lowest,and no this is not based completely on a true story,more than half of it is made up.i repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10,but the movie is just a little too much,the actor's nasal voice just makes me want to go blow my nose.unless you are a real him mesh fan this movie is a huge no-no.

i have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and i must say that i never felt that bad, which i felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very bad. there were songs & songs. nobody should watch this movie. the director has shown germans speaking english which is so rubbish. germans does not speak english. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked himesh for autograph. (obv that he must have gave some money to her) in the promo they have shown prepare for laughing riot. but i could say there was only one scene where that himesh was laughing for no reason may be he thinks he's funny. hansika is very good. she is like an angel. but too young only 16 yrs old. if you have plenty of time and don't know what to do then you should watch this movie or else its waste of money

whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? only hope this is first and the last as well, for god's sake ! from assalam valekum to gayatri mantra, himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. why does himesh not smile ? simple, because he does not use close up toothpaste ! now there this friend of his, tailing him around every where, and this number one lawyer in the town, who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce himesh, of all the handsome german people she might have met earlier, perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate, for destined to deal with the stiff, unattractive lot, every day ! the action scenes are so funnily shot, like the event planner attacked by the thief, autos riding over the cars, so on and so forth. the father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off, that he flies to and fro around. most hypocrite, he praises hr for distributing love among people of the world, as if they were sweets , and on his back, coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men. when himesh is proved innocent, he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy, as if it's a game of musical chair ! i didn't get to se the poor guy's face even, did you ? hansika in the role of ria, looks as if she is in need of an eye check up, for strain in her eyes ! the fellow in the role of a friend is good, who has acted quite naturally, and should be in better movies, like sharman joshi, for example. child artist in trishu's brief appearance is sweet, but wasted. it seems today's young generation has gone nuts , since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores , and associate gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. this is a weird taste in music, and rather funny. i am surprised, how such classic lyricists like gulzar , have opted for himesh of all the people, to give music. there is story in panchtantra , that a crow attachés so many feathers of a peacock, to look beautiful, and appeal to the birds; but the feathers fall off ultimately, and the real dark crow is revealed ! hope himesh takes a hint, and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff, and wasting precious money, which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much ! his friend does tell him, if your nose is cut, how will you sing ? thanks for showing us germany, himesh, at a reasonable cost of renting the dvd ! and correct those spelling mistakes, will you ? an extra e in movie, and no e in love ! there is also a famous number from the old film sholey, mehbooba, on which mallika sherawat wiggles, once again, but this time with himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, ria , his so-called real love, and his new bride is not around ! now that was very clever, himesh ! at least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly, to justify sherawat's presence . but doesn't she look a bit washed down ?

if you feel reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. his face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. this is way far from a real love story (get the spelling right, reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, himesh getting imprisoned, himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ... if you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this one, especially the scenes where he howls in mehbooba. if you despise the nasal twangs, and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of reshammiya can do to you, then don't miss this movie.i couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the very end. the only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography, locations, and a couple of the songs. even then, until you are a die hard reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.

one of the most awaited movie!i thought himesh will do a bit of acting but alas all my hope went wrong..given that the heroine is 15 yrs old!!!!omg!!what did they thought before considering the actress..may be its because no boby wants to work with hr(as he is called in the film,(human resource as many people wrote in mazagines!)nevertheless it was a disappointment.i hope the producer doesn't make himself bankrupt by making a part 2 of this as this news is roaming around...the story was predictable one with himesh showing his generosity character throughout the movie which i doubt very well.anyways..the movie is good from those people's angle who thinks himesh cant do anything wrong. >>4 out of 10<<

first things first, how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this. i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head, what exactly is director trying to say.if its a thriller, there are no thrills, if its action, there is no action barring a chase sequence, there is no drama, and the much touted love story, it actually never takes off. no passion, emotion nothing is there.actually i never expected wonders from the movie, however after the bumper opening it took, i thought of giving it a chance. i have no problems with himesh reshamiya whatsoever, and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity. i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed one.let's not put the blame of himesh reshamiya, he is just a debutant actor. but direction, screenplay, writing, makeup, everything has gone for a toss.himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve. he can do the don kind of roles. hansika is just a kid, and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks.the only actor who was good was the friend of himesh in the movie, i don't know his name, but he looks promising.watch it at your own risk, not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing.** strongly recommend to avoid this movie.**

i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. where do i start, it's a complete mess. the main attraction of course was the soundtrack. which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what himesh does best. but as they say, don't give up your day job - hr definitely shouldn't.hr's acting is plain and simply awful. even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there. two words of advice to hr - give up acting and secondly, use chapstick.hr has no screen presence, no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him. as for malika sherawat - just the same old bollywood vamp crap. you can package the product as much as you want, but if there's no substance it won't hold. don't waste your money...

ego. seems it's the only reason this movie was made. this movie is so wrong in so many ways that it's below one's dignity to write much about it. every character was only good at self praise and lead actors (i use this term liberally as has the director) emote in the likeness of stone. the little story, if that, fails on the basic aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. direction leaves much to be desired. blatant flaws are all over the place (character motives aren't defined, prospective husbands are found overnight, broken car windows mend themselves among other things)let's face it, himesh can't act. neither, it seems, can hansika motwani. in her defense, she's still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make-up. raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible. darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much. the actor who plays himesh's friend is the only natural. a few questions do come to mind: how can such a film cost rs.500,000,000?? where did the money go??? granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind. (including 3 mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car)the good: himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark "topi." let's give the devil his due: himesh, as usual gives good music.the bad: direction, story, himesh's singing is still hard to ignorethe ugly: dialogs and everything else!!!final word: painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghai's "yaadein"

frank tashlin's 'censored' is a so-so private snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the south pacific but the censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. these early scenes are the best, with the unseen censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! the second half of the cartoon, in which snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of technical fairy, first class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only-a-dream finale. the main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! aimed at the military, the snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic i've come across in any of these shorts thus far. despite all this, i prefer the snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. for great examples of this, seek out tashlin's 'the goldbrick' or chuck jones's 'spies'. 'censored' is fairly weak by comparison.

i totally agree. this is "pitch black underground" and a well worn plot. the best scenes i thought were the divers exploring the caves, going through impossible subterranean passageways, some of them were heart pounding. the scenery was great. had they dispensed with the staple "alien" toothy cgi badboys entirely the movie would have been much better. all they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering, and follow jack's descent into madness, and this might have been a top rate hitchcock-style thriller, maybe award material. the acting isn't bad. but those rubber bats just reduce it to standard fare.

the movie "the cave" has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there was no plot, no story-line, and the lighting was terrible. for most of the movie, i was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights. the persistent 'grey' spaces throughout the movie were irksome. the only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in hell. all in all, the movie was not really worth watching. if the producers cannot come up with something better than this, they should find another occupation. the underwater scenes were particularly awful, being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights, with the occasional look at the actors. in summation, a really awful movie with bad lighting, extraneous flashes throughout.

if you described any of the scenes; nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep, your infant daughter talking to ghosts, searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night, so petrified with fear that you can't move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above  then i'd say you had a horror movie. but some how 'wicked little things' just wasn't scary. i am a horror fan and i loved the location, the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies. i didn't want to see them come to harm, i wanted the 'bad guy' to get his just desserts, the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every cliché in the book - even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you.i would still recommend that you watch it, but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years, you will have seen it all before.

in 1913, in carlton mine, addytown, pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children in the exploration and after an explosion, a group of children is buried alive. on the present days, karen tunny (lori heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease when the family savings have been spent in the treatment. without any money, she moves with her daughters sarah (scout taylor-compton) and emma (chloe moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night, and sarah hears that there are zombies in the area. when emma becomes friend of mary, he mother believes she is an imaginary friend. however, when sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and emma vanishes, karen and sarah chase her nearby the mine."wicked little things" is not a totally bad movie: the acting is good; the make-up is creepy; and the cinematography and the music score are excellent. however, the story, and consequently the screenplay, are very weak, indeed a bad collection of clichés. the beginning is reasonable, with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch. but when she arrives, coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences, for example, families do not search the missing persons. then the wicked mr. carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical clichés that he will die in the end. there is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing mr. carlton. when sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore, it is one the most stupid lines that i have ever seen in a horror movie. my vote is four.title (brazil): "zombies"

i saw wicked little things as part of the "8 films to die for" horrorfest, and this was the only film that disappointed me. to wit, a mom, her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the pennsylvania mountains. every night, however, the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find.i guess the director was banking on his viewers being repulsed that children would be capable of pickaxe murders and eating human flesh (of which there are lavish close-ups, as a nice homage to george romero) because the film just isn't scary otherwise. simply put, there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids jogging to their next murder site. if someone's gonna get it in the barn, there will be a shot of the kids arriving at the barn (oh the suspense) and then moving in for the kill.come to think of it, why do the kids suddenly walk so slowly when they corner their prey? and not that i have any experience in this, but i think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot farther than this film implies...? nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents i've ever seen in any film. "the lock on the front door is busted"? you have an eight-year-old daughter in the woods with bears and mountain lions! fix it, you moron!!! plus, mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age- even for a teen pregnancy, and there's a pretty unbelievable death which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt.i'm giving this a 3 because it tried. as a splatter film it's not bad. but for good scares, go elsewhere.

even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, i found this film to be beyond awful. it was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight horrorfest films. i can only hope the other seven were better. i was actually embarrassed for the friends i was able to convince to see this, and these are the same friends i made watch the remake of the wicker man. it has every cliché in the book. in fact, it went out of its way to include them. let's start with the characters. instead of one young damsel in distress, we get three: the single, hot mom with two daughters a blossoming yet brainless teenager and a cute yet simultaneously creepy little girl that you just know is going to have 'special' skills including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. the little girl is the same one that was in the remake of the amityville horror. she was a little annoying but not nearly as irritating dakota fanning.overall, these characters seemed like escapees from a lifetime movie. i thought perhaps horror movies had moved on from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears, but not this one. i also find it inconceivable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from arbitrarily opening day and night. to give you an idea about how uninvolved i was with these characters, i spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were.despite all the formulaic plot machinations, the film does not build any suspense at all except to wonder when it will be over. there is more atmosphere at the local giant in the middle of the most mundane of weekday afternoons. as for the dialogue, i could have sampled quotes from ten other films and cobbled together better, more believable discourse. the gore level, the eye candy for a horror fan, was minimal at best. without their tiny weapons, the 'zombies' were not menacing at all. you could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room.what really kills it is its banality. horror films, more than any other genre, cannot survive uninspired mediocrity. give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously over the top with gore. i can even take the new ones with their cringe inducing torture. every once in a while i'd appreciate a truly frightening one, anything but this.

i'm guessing that the folks talking up this drivel are cronies of the director or something. this is bad, and not in the michael jackson song kind of way. to compare the pacing of this movie to the progress of a snail would be to insult the snail. this movie limps along for what seems like an eternity, all to introduce us to some un-scary zombie kids with silly makeup and some sort of vendetta, or thirst for blood, or whatever. believe me, you won't care. the thought alone that mom would move her two daughters into this dilapidated and filthy home is absurd. and worse, i found myself simply not caring. backstory about the zombie kids? snore. endangerment of mom and/or daughters? don't care.in short, wow was this dull. don't bother.

i am speechless. matty simmons has managed to do something i thought impossible. he has made "the harlem globetrotters on gilligan's island" look like "citizen kane." painful cannot even begin to describe this piece of... i don't know. mind you, the premise sounded funny, but now that i've seen it, it's funny in the way that dropping an anvil on your scrotum is funny.i won't bother to describe the premise, as the title says it all, if only to say i don't think there was literally one funny thing in this film, not one, not even the monkey bite. how could one of the funniest characters in the "vacation" franchise, the sleazy white trash eddie (randy quaid), be made so horrifically unfunny ? i never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life. i equally pitied the other actors participating in this "comedic" atrocity, miriam flynn (catherine, eddie's long suffering, but sunny-dispositioned wife), dana barron (the original audrey griswold), fred willard, and the stunning sung hi lee (perhaps the only reason to watch the film, if only with the sound off), save for that old commie, ed asner (uncle nick), he had it coming. alas, the audience didn't. i only say "thank heavens" that chevy chase, who has been in a slump for years, steered clear of this diarrhea splatter, it's the smartest career move he ever made.i don't know if you folks are religious like i am, but i know i'll be praying to the lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time i spent in front of the television that i'll never get back otherwise.hot water burn baby says zero out of 10 stars (if you take a few hits off the bong and drink the water, maybe 1/10th of a star out of 10)

the only reason to see this film is sung hi lee, the stunning model/actress from korea who plays "muka laka miki" (give me a break) in this otherwise crappy movie. she is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well, though none of the parts is really interesting or well written. even for a national lampoon's movie, it's really stupid. stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. i may have laughed once, and that was probably just me being polite.warning: watching this movie may be bad for your health on two counts: 1) it, like, totally sucks. 2) sung hi lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your brains out of the back of your head upon first sight.so don't say i didn't warn you...

i have just given a 10 for thieves highway, i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. pretty woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. my feeling is this 'happy hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. secondly, 'pretty woman' insults romance itself, edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please.girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'thieves highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.i'll finish on a song:pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman, the kind i like to treat pretty woman, i don't believe you you're not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercypretty woman, wont you pardon me pretty woman, i couldn't help but see pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like mepretty woman, shop a while pretty woman, talk a while pretty woman, sell your smile to me pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah pretty woman, look my way pretty woman, say you'll stay with me..and i'll pay you..i'll treat you right

the first time i saw this was when i was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. i didn't.the second time i saw this was last night on tv. it still sucks.as a love story this sucks. as having julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. to me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. she had no tough shell to her. she wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. her "hooker" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. the two simply don't fit, no matter what they look like.the only cast i felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen, whom were excellently cast. they did such a fine job that i hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen. they had real definition, for the minor roles. ok, so the movie wasn't entirely trash...the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film.aside from those two women sales people, the rest of the cast...including the big names was just crap. either everybody was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting julia roberts or kissing ass to richard gere.this was a movie about how when you walk around in high-heels and a tight skirt in beverly hills, people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face.while in reality, the women who are dressed to the nines in beverly hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they aren't wearing the gaudy madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots, they can look down on the others who do.the hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch, and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time.this is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect.the story is about julia roberts being pimped (yes pimped) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine.she is still owned, still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. he is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at disney/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.had richard gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an ak-47 at his side instead of an attaché case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or asian or spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.as far as i'm concerned, pretty woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.i didn't like it 15 years ago, when i didn't understand it and was led by the hollywood hype. i hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called "love".this movie is not a romantic comedy. it's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so.this is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen.do i hate it? yes. does it suck? yes would i recommend it to you? no...well maybe if i really hated you.will this review get posted? we'll see.anywayz, that's all for now.

i was wondering if there was a place or a link that someone can send me or post for me so i can watch this show . it seems to be a missing show i have been looking for years now its about oz and a girl who has to help save it . it was really good . but i found a good oz type thing on the web but i cant find it again or seem to remember a lot of it due to being years and was thinking that this one maybe it and from reading all this it sounds good and maybe the missing show that i really liked please someone help me thanks so much so please anyone that can help me or give me a link that would be so helpful again thank you so much....or if anyone has an oz based good videos please post as well.

when this show began it was fairly interesting: we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab-catching season. soon after, however, it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman. episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn' (this one happens way too often), 'someone is injured or sick', 'a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat', repeat. i don't know how people can find the newest seasons watchable, as every episode seems to be essentially the same as those before and after it. this show should be moved to a different channel and renamed to "crab boat drama", or, even better, it would have made a perfect one-time segment on dirtiest jobs. shouldn't the discovery channel have learned their lesson after american choppers?

i just watched this movie last night. within 30 minutes of the start, i was hoping it would end.it had a promising beginning; the first 10 minutes. the premise of this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms) is just not believable. he does kiss her somewhere along the way, and she feels ohh, so terrible about it. very little substance to grab your interest. the acting just does not hold up. he is very passive. regardless of how much of the movie is shown, the viewer never develops any type of a caring connection with the characters on the screen. you learn that her next utterance will be as boring as her previous one. ("do you have a cigarette ?", he doesn't smoke, he wants her to stop smoking, doesn't she know this by now.)she calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year's absence, she comes in through the door, they don't even hug or kiss or express any type of emotional connection. he doesn't even lean forward to lift her suitcase to help her in. that is not how real people behave, this is not how best pals behave.when he receives her phone call in the middle of the night (she is in town for one day), he shows little interest to see her face, acts more like she will be a burden for the night. at this point they've known each other for two years and he hasn't seen her for a year. not believable, not real. supposedly, he has written a book on entropy and enthalpy, yet we never see him write or read or discuss any of his interests in physics with her, not that she would be able to handle the discussion. we learn that a watermelon in l.a. costs $50, (it wasn't the silicon type mind you) he has no problem affording that fruit. we also learn that the airport shuts down when a few really really fake snow flakes fall off the sky. i'm sorry but was that in l.a. too?we never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. we never see them struggle, they are always on vacation. they have infinite time, they have no worries whatsoever. nice life. unreal life. unreal characters. bad title. bad movie.

as one of the victims of the whole enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. how many times can i say awful? the script was so weak, using cliche after cliche. it seems as though the writers pieced this story together with a few articles on enron. watching the movie, we honestly were able to complete about half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. i realize this was supposedly adapted from a book, but was the book this bad? i don't know what to say. just terrible. the best thing about the movie? shannon elizabeth actually kept her clothes on. other than that, this movie gets a big fat f.

...this one just isn't worth the cost of a movie ticket. what these filmmakers have done cannot properly be called filmmaking; rather, they just chose sixteen students of some diversity (though not quite as much diversity as the reviews have suggested) and set them loose. the results are, to be brutally frank, far more often boring, self-indulgent, overwrought and off-puttingly grainy than truly insightful.there are, of course, moments of recognition and identification of the sort only possible in documentary film, but overall there's not much more truth here than in "bully" or, for that matter, a decent tv documentary of the same sort. though full of talk about sex and sexual diversity and racism, the film brings nothing to the table that will be of use to anyone who has thought about any of these issues with any seriousness. and while certain segments serve absolutely no purpose other than to inject a bit of (admittedly welcome) comic relief, most often the five-minute limit keeps up from becoming emotionally involved with any of the students. an interesting idea, but thumbs down for chain camera.

the first film was quite hip and had amusing moments, this film doesn't exactly have the same standard. calvin palmer (ice cube) is still trying to keep his barbershop going, but this isn't just against stylist gina (queen latifah) with a beauty shop next door, but soon enough a big barbershop chain called nappy cutz opening across the street. calvin, along with co-workers and friends eddie (cedric the entertainer), jimmy (sean patrick thomas), terri (eve) and isaac rosenberg (troy garity), they are doing everything they can to keep regular customers coming, and ultimately their business running against the competition. also starring michael ealy as ricky nash, leonard earl howze as dinka, harry lennix as quentin leroux, robert wisdom as alderman brown, jazsmin lewis as jennifer, kenan thompson as kenard and bad company's garcelle beauvais-nilon as loretta. i didn't like this film as much as the first because of the unnecessary flashbacks about eddie, and it isn't as witty, i just got bored of it. okay!

first of all, i personally adore demons and demons 2, i saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in russia when i was a kid, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. then i heard nothing about mr bava. then i saw his ghost son. well, it is certainly not a good coming back! why was the leading character, whom we never really knew to at least like him, in accident in the middle of an empty road? why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul? why is the plot so primitive? haven't we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of movie production? it is clear that lamberto bava has nothing to show us so far. it is a shame.

"ghost son" is lamberto bava's best film and, at the same time, also his worst. i suppose that statement requires some slight clarification. it's his best because it's well directed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it's a dull, unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of bava's past efforts. let's face it: many fans, myself certainly included, wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title. the only motivation here was lamberto bava, who brought us large amounts of convoluted gialli and fun splatter films in the past. "ghost son" is a bit of his comeback film, alongside "the torturer", and although the latter definitely isn't a good film, it at least lives up to his fans' lines of expectations, with excessive amounts of sleaze, blood and sadism. "ghost son" is a weak and intolerably soft horror film, even talking in terms of mainstream ghost stories. the emphasis lies too much on sentimentality, and this badly affects the already limited number of horrific & creepily atmospheric moments. the basic premise might feature one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is overall dull and far too clichéd. john hannah and laura harring star as a happy couple, living on a remote ranch in south africa and breeding horses for a living. the joy and happiness couldn't possibly improve, so naturally something tragic is bound to happen, and it does. mark dies in a car accident, but the inconsolable stacey remains at the ranch where she's in constant contact with mark's spirit. she even gets pregnant with his child, but shortly after baby martin's birth mysterious events begin to occur. it seems as if mark's restless and selfish ghost 'possessed' the baby and uses him to encourage stacy into committing suicide. with all the focus on the couple's relationship, many of the events and sub plots are underdeveloped and/or remains unexplained, like the whole background of the youthful maid thandi. there's too little action and the only real fright-moments are too obviously borrowed from classic films such as "the exorcist" and "rosemary's baby" (vomiting green goo, self moving furniture). purely talking in terms of horrific entertainment "ghost son" is a painful misfire, but it has to be said, it's a beautiful and enchanting looking failure. the cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive. the moody score sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere even though there's nothing of any significance happening on screen. there are several beautiful images of the south african wildlife to admire but, if that interests you, i suppose you're better off watching national geographic instead. not much to recommend here. fans of atmosphere-driven ghost stories have much better options to choose from and die-hard bava fanatics are advised to (re-)watch "demons", "macabre" or "blade in the dark".

alas, it seems that the golden times of stylish italian cinema have sunk into oblivion. and the recent brainchild of celebrated filmmaker lamberto bava is yet another obvious proof to that assumption.i felt lucky to watch many films from this prolific director (like body puzzle, delerium, macabre and both demons). albeit not entirely satisfying they have never been that dull.a suspicion that this new entry to my dvd collection was money thrown to the winds arose shortly in the aftermath of the car crash scene exhibiting an awkward and unlikely position of the body under the flip-over car.and the sense of shallowness grew up in the course of the ponderously narrated chain of events that followed.dumb dialogs, suspenseless script and a total waste of talents from the international cast. the only character that provided more or less passable performance was the mischievous mark's son juicing up the entire boredom.unfortunately, mario's son job on all accounts could hardly be hailed.i look forward to seeing his murder house hopefully expected to be an improvement.

i started off being interested somewhat in the movie. it appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. alas, it didn't hold up.i need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. look, i know this was not supposed to be shakespeare, but come on, i need some quality in script and characterization.the acting was alright, the writing not so much. at one point, james brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed. he states that ordering him around will not work. his new wife says that if he goes home and changes she will rip his clothes off later. that is a howler. this movie had a few unintentionally funny lines.it was hard to care about jame's brolin's character. when he so readily gave his first wife's things to his new wife, even allowing his daughter to be snubbed, i lost most of my sympathy. who really cares what happens to him. i must confess that i did not finish the movie. if it did a 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes, let me know. it was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable i felt there was no need to finish it.

to start this movie was sick. here your wife is dying and you go strutting around town with this blond chic by your side. then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. hank (james brolin) is definitely moving fast throughout this movie. i called him fast hank. fast hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with his best friends. the part that gets me is when she is "doing it" in the barn with kevin and gets caught by another one of hanks friends. kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her robe and bam!! right into the arms of this other guy and they start "doing it" right then and there. i guess he is finishing up what kevin started. how gross!!!! i am like this is lifetime movie??? its a typical old man young woman movie that says you can have my body if i get your money...

stunning blonde natasha henstridge is the young, not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill, telling her story to a tv reporter in monroeville, virginia. and among the community's well-heeled horsey-set, she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband. that's james brolin, trusting as a babe-in-arms. flashback teledrama made in canada, based on an article that appeared in vanity fair magazine. it must be true! whatever, it's far more romance than mystery, and a very familiar tale. leggy species star henstridge as a gold-digging hospice nurse? it could happen, i guess. and it's good to see brolin in a sizeable role after his titchy turn in antwone fisher, even if he doesn't make it to the end of the picture. the end of the picture? he doesn't even make it to the beginning of the picture. which is why flashbacks were invented, of course.

somehow, this documentary about miles manages to include very little music and no complete tunes. though miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other folks, not miles. there are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood prodigy, his drug addiction) are skipped or glossed over, and you'll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking. skip it.

first the premise stinks...little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. it reminded me of norman bates in psycho or ed wood in ed wood. the jokes are lame and old, you've seen 'em in a dozen 50's & 60's films. the whole cast is wasted. i bet people signed on just to be in a shirley maclaine vehicle. please, would somebody tell shirley she did her best comedy in two mules for sister sara. see it...if there's no reruns of andy griffith on.

this movie was terrible. the plot was terrible and unbelievable. i cannot recommend this movie. where did this movie come from? this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including: gary sinise, kathy bates, joey lauren adams, and jennifer tilly.

*****spoiler or two, not that is matters******two things stand out about this movie. first is it's been titled both "bruno" and "the dress code," and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that.second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall. the adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about, nor a topic that i think most people would be interested in. shirley maclaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying bruno's desire to wear a dress to religion, which probably opens up an even thornier can of worms--what was she thinking? yes, there's some humor and it's not directly offensive, but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing. it doesn't do much except repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or maybe excepted?) no matter what. which is fine----but in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along. bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress, he wants to show up looking like a miniature gladys knight on awards night, and his final costume makes him resemble a cabbage patch cowgirl doll. yet all the other kids dress and behave, well, like regular kids. so what gives? if it came down to it we all could declare ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like, and the result would be total chaos. this accepting of people who are "different" is also pretty narrowly defined, i doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear overalls, hunt geese, and go to tractor pulls, and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is. "bruno" is one stupid movie, and a complete waste of time.

brainy, cross-dressing little boy finds success on the spelling bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. shirley maclaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother, and it is always fascinating to see long-time actors getting their chance at directing a film, the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with. here, the only person well-cast in "bruno" is maclaine. the child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness, and squishy-hearted maclaine holds their close-ups for excruciatingly long periods; nothing about these cherubs seems natural, not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. as the boy's disgruntled father, poor gary sinise hovers around the edges, in mock shame, always with a pained look on his face. towards the end of the film, maclaine turns the whole thing into a passel of hugging scenes, and even concludes with the kid hugging the pope in rome! another ungodly treatise from a talented actress-turned-director who, much like sally field and her film "beautiful", cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience. shirley uses ethnicity for shtick, and childhood innocence as a punchline. the children in this cast roll their eyes, crack wise with mature comments, use big words--but when one mealy-mouthed boy calls our pint-sized hero "gay", maclaine's granny instructs him to go over and punch the kid out (in front the media!). how's that for progression? * from ****

this is a horrific re-make of the french movie ma vie en rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). the only scenario that i can imagine in which anyone (sinise?! bates?! butler?! what were they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is maclaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for american audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid. then she enlisted other friends to sign up, and they did so as friends -- certainly not on the merits of this pathetically contrived, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink script.i'm not a knee-jerk fan of french film, but ma vie en rose is a subtle, thoughtful, and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. i would love to see it get wider exposure among english-speaking audiences -- and if that means an american re-make, so be it. but puh-leeze! a little respect for the issues and the intelligence of the audience -- and better direction for the actors, who couldn't seem to decide if they were working for tennessee williams or jerry lewis!

this odd little film starts out with the story of bruno (alex linz) in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday. he likes to wear dresses and his obese mother angela who is a dressmaker doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes. angela complains to mother superior (kathy bates) but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs. bruno's father dino (gary sinise) is divorced from angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him. bruno meets a new student at school named shawniqua (kiami davael) who is a free spirit and dresses like annie oakley with cap pistols. angela has a heart attack and bruno's grandmother steps in to take care of him when dino refuses.the film starts out with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved. angela has a great deal to do with bruno wearing dresses as she practically encourages him. dino was told when he was a young boy by his mother that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help bruno when he needs it. the catholic school that bruno attends is very unruly and all the kids run rampant and even call shawniqua the "n" word. once shirley maclaine steps in the film shifts and becomes more family oriented (so to speak). ****spoiler alert**** the ending after the spelling bee is incredibly contrived and "feel good". hugs and cheers for bruno as reporters follow him and take his picture for their papers. all the while shirley maclaine is acting like the "tough old broad" who snaps at everyone. there is one thing about maclaine's character in the film that no one has mention in these comments and it has to do with the masculine nature of her. i think the character of helen might be a lesbian! she's very tough and strong and at one point in the film she shares a shot of whiskey with bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. i don't remember anyone in the film mentioning who her husband was or if she was ever married at all! this is why i think her character might be gay. lots of other good actors appear in the film as well. joey lauren adams, jennifer tilly, brett butler, gwen verdon and lainie kazan all should have taken a better look at the script before they signed on. i guess when they heard that maclaine was directing that it would be an honor to be part of it. very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject matter is probably impossible for most to relate to. the actors are not bad but what exactly was maclaine aiming for? tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression? we get that in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time i was trying not to cringe.

this movie was disturbing, not because of the subject matter but because of the way it was handled. the extremely overweight mother (angela) did not even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did. this is not fair but is a statement in itself. i also notice her picture is missing from imdb (maybe her own choice) and it looks like this is her only film ever? the language in this movie was crude beyond necessity. watched with my 10yr old son because it was rated pg in canada and the language coming out of their mouths was shameful & disgusting. never did appreciate shirley maclain like so many others seem to.love kathy bates and always will. sinese's part was annoying.the little boy alex is a great little actor. i'll have to see what else he's been up to lately..

the recent documentary "the adventures of errol flynn" is an in-depth look at the ultimate hollywood hero. bogart,cagney, wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. if he hadn't been under contract to warner bros. he would've of been perfect in the cary grant role in suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator. and he could've starred with his best leading ladies sister joan fontaine. that was flynn's trouble he was the ultimate screen hero until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him. grant and flynn in a way are similar but flynn was the more macho of the two;it is possible to see grant as captain blood but flynn in the philadelphia story mr. blanding builds his dream house,or monkey business,or operation petticoat would've turned those roles on their collective ears because he's too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would've brought naturally would've made the story lines wobbly. but this wobbly biography is just a plasticized view of flynn and his era. there are times when i half expected a laugh track or an audience to go "ahhh" at some point. it doesn't go deeply into flynn's life just the screen magazine view. it also doesn't delve into his struggle to be considered more than a derring-doer. like the cleaned up biographies of lon chaney( the father,not the wolfman,or lenny"of mice and men) and buster keaton done in the '50's this is just a time killing piece of fluff

after watching this film, i thought to myself, they really glossed up errol flynn's life! the movie is really nice eye candy. they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right. the costumes were great. all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair.is this a serious film about errol flynn's life? nah! it's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life.why am i critiquing this film? this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver. duncan reagher was really good as errol flynn. he was not as good looking as the original, but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously, but as a man who, although gifted with great talent, was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside. flynn's love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages. he also lost a lot of good friends during his life. he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland. the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away. he is shown in his tux, looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool. it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle.this film could've had much more depth, could've been better well-written. sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynn's human center. surprisingly, duncan reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didn't put any depth there.i'll probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film, "gosh, this could've been so much more.....!" i give this film a d+.

if you read errol flynn's autobiography, my wicked, wicked ways, you will see that this film is full of poetic licence. not that that makes much of a difference, because errol flynn was pretty generous with poetic licence in the autobiography anyway. no need to worry about spoilers, since there is nothing there to spoil.to me it would seem more sensible to use the story about a fictitious hollywood actor; then you could go out and find a better actor than duncan regehr to play him, and you wouldn't have to worry about the audience saying things like: "but he didn't have a moustaches in captain blood." another failing of this film is that it shows flynn as a two-dimensional character. flynn was an intelligent man, well educated, well read. this film only concentrates on his funster image.regehr is a disaster. the rest of the cast struggle with their scripts. hal linden is ok as warner, and barbara hershey makes a believable damita, although lili damita herself did not think so.the best thing to do with this film is to forget about it and let it gently slip away to oblivion. so what i am writing this for, i can't imagine.

they said it would be a film greater than turks fruit. how darethey? it's not even 10% of this classic. bad acting. the only character i felt sympathy for was the oneplayed by angela schijf. her acting was the best in the whole film. the story could've been interesting, but it wasn't. some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (theopening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magicdisappear.i really don't understand why so many people voted this film sogood.

actually i'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie i like. as for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. the acting was too bad in my opinion. not very likely that antonie kamerling will get a rutger hauer status. some folks will expect it anyway. first let him work on his english pronunciation. if you watch the 'trip' to paris of these actors (dvd-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. advice to beau dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there... to the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please. being generous, i'd give it 4 out of 10.

if this was the best dutch cinema had to offer these years, my worst fears have come true. i have never, even in dutch movies, seen worse acting. i couldn't get myself to watch it for more than 40 minutes, so if that's the cause of me missing the genius, so be it.

as a fan of author gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which ik ook van jou is not the best one), i was looking forward to see this film. i didn't catch it in cinema though, and after seeing it on to tv i'm terribly happy i resisted buying it on video. out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in dutch film history. all the good parts have been left out, the story is changed, not to its benefits. all humour has been cut out. what's left is a bad-acted, over dramatic, non-consistent film that i do not want to watch again ever.i condolate giphart with this result, and am happy that robbert jan westdijk did a hell of a better job on giphart's topper phileine zegt sorry. go see that one!

this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a while. the acting was just soooo bad. anthonie kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. especially his voice over was extremely wooden. beau van erven dorens was completely over the top as frat boy fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. 'ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue. it all sounded way to bookish.some of the situations were very badly visualized. example: somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid. this bit is just too incredible to be true. you see an obviously rather shallow bit of river, with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface (hence the rapid). we hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there's danger ahead. a canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid. our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl. girl swoons in his arms and utters the words 'you saved me...' vomit!it actually was so bad, that it became funny. this is sad, because it really wasn't intended. at the intermission i overheard some guy behind me say 'o god, there's another part!' my feelings exactly. what scares me is that the end credits of 'ik ook van jou' were in english. does this mean that it will be released abroad? just when the netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like 'antonia' (antonia's line) and 'karakter' (character)...

one of the movies i just didn't want to see. i got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! at the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it's filmed from a book of giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.

yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. we picked "ik ook van jou" more or less at random, but we were interested to see the state of current dutch filmmaking.the film is based on a book by ronald giphart, and i must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. the film features actors that are best known in the netherlands for their appearances in soap-operas and/or afternoon talk shows. at least one of them (kamerling) has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world. so we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt.and what a mistake that was. this movie fails on all fronts. bad acting (the best performance is actually by a guinea pig, which very convincingly pretends to be dead). flat, uninteresting story with unexplained and uninteresting sidelines (why france? why tell the story to a girl from uganda?) mistakes (black people dont have to use sunscreen, as far as i know, and heating systems in the netherlands do not produce clouds of steam like in new york, even if this looks great on film, people do not wear t-shirts outside on new years eve in northern europe). there's one funny moment which involves two little dogs, and that's it.so that's what i think, but more importantly, it seemed that none of the people leaving the movie theater afterwards had enjoyed it. i overheard one of them saying that he was extremely disappointed, because he liked the book so much. i did not read the book, but my advice would have to be: read the book, don't see the film.

from 2002 on dutch cinema finally got better again. this movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of dutch cinema.the story is needlessly told in flashback style. all of the 'present' sequences set in france are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. for some reason european filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. i never understood why, or what the appeal of it is.the story self also isn't exactly the greatest. it isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell. the story of a young unexperienced boy falling in love with a wild young girl, who later turns out to be quite psychotic might sound good enough on paper and even shows some parallels to paul verhoeven's "turks fruit", to which this movie often was compared to before and at the time of its release. however the end result is far from comparable. the story fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the unimaginative performances from the actors. the way the story is told also makes the movie far from always interesting or compelling. i lost interest for this movie at about 40 minutes through the movie.at the time this movie was made, both antonie kamerling and angela schijf were promising rising stars, with great potential and ambitions but both their careers have pretty much dried up by now. angela schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career (that is not a bad thing of course), while antonie kamerling tried to start a career in hollywood. he never got any further than playing some small bit parts in 2 renny harlin flops. to be honest i'm not surprised. it's not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has got the right looks but his english just isn't good enough, to put it mildly. just listen to him speaking english in the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what i mean. they are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie. it's probably also due to the poor dialog. i still kind of liked beau van erven dorens. he's been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural. he always keeps the characters close to who he self is.it by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it's not exactly one i would recommend either. bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie.4/10

i'm really amazed that this got an 88% on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars. the 7.3 rating on imdb... that's not so much of a surprise, seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently. i just can't get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted, and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. which, it turns out, actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of genghis khan. the far-fetched and over-dramatized mongol often echoes the likes of 300, a film that couldn't be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, mongol takes itself seriously. it's stoic seriousness, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies, is what makes it truly the most boring film i've seen this year; possibly the most action or biopic movie i've ever seen. the characters were pathetically written. honestly, i doubt genghis khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film. which is funny to me, because if there's anything that i'd think should be changed for the sake of theatricality, it's making a boring person into an interesting person. the romance between khan and borte is similarly boring, simple, and stupid. also, without giving anything away, mongol contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time- where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development, the film just skips forward without any explanation. it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing. (did i mention how seriously mongol takes itself?) meanwhile, it drags like no film i've ever seen before. even now, i could swear it was three hours long. about 45 minutes into it, i checked the time, being pretty certain that it was almost finished. besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from asano (naturally), mongol is honestly just a disaster. it completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me in anyway. i would never give this film a second chance. and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever, but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day. at least then i know what i'm getting, unlike with mongol, where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeing.the saddest thing about how much i hated mongol is that i have friends who i know, without a doubt, would simply love it.

the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months. the plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. the jokes where really poor. the narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about mongolian history, traditions etc. my co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost. i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all. it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end.

the narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story i think i've seen disguised in a slew of other films. i never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging, killing and double crossing his way to the top. the one redeeming quality was the photography- the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film, unfortunately combined with the bleakness of the story- i left unmoved, and disappointed..

i was waiting for this movie for a time. in the first day of the air in turkey, i watched it. it was totally a disappointment for me. i was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. first of all, the main character of the movie cengiz han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. you can not feel the power in the movie. historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years. to do that, cengiz first unite the asian tribes. however, in the movie, this loser man is in one scene poor-alone man, and in second scene, he is commanding armies. war scenes were incredibly week. in the final battle, the mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy. : ) as a consequences, me and my friends just laugh at that scenes. mongol army means mongol archery horseman. you can not see that in the movie. another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. i do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed cengiz as a prophet. we can say in the integrity of the movie, it is acceptable. however, the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of cengiz khan after cengiz gave him a mission is really funny. when the monk died in the desert, cengiz's wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent. we are talking about the asia again we laughed. there are a lot of more things to say but, i don't feel that this movie has value to talk more.

i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time i checked ghengis khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! awfully acted - i found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth! a saving grace of the film was the cinematography. that is why i gave this film a 2 star-rating rather than the bare minimum! however, if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead! all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money! please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss!

as a genghis khan "fan" i was looking forward to this movie. after devouring conn igguldens epic novels about genghis and reading up on loads of historic records i feel i know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...that turned out a deception. this movie is practically made up from beginning to end. there are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. that does not have to be a problem, i like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring. nothing of the greatness comes forth in this movie.i would not recommend this movie if you know anything on the subject.

have seen this movie today. very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist. the most sad things are:1. it's very slow. 2. how ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? 3. lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. we see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. click! - the very next second he's leading the huge army, without any reasons to be a leader. 4. the magic of ghengis-khan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf/god/whoever it was. 5. can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years? 6. is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies? does ridley scott know that way? 7. why after 20-30 years khan's mother doesn't look older? 8. what is the motivation for the main character? (none. literally.)don't waste your time. really. cinematographers's work is good; the nature is outstanding - but the movie cannot be made without director and script. the real ghengis-khan would execute director in a second.kind regards.

i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.we were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. two hours and six minutes long, it is. it's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.one would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. there's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. however the writers fluffed it completely. we get no real history. we get instead a hollywood version of history.what sustains young temudjin through his long -- almost endless, actually, or so they seem to the viewer -- tribulations? why, the love of a good woman, of course.how does he get out of prison? well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises temudjin's love for her, dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there, talisman in his hand. and of course she then goes and, having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful, rescues him.how does he escape from the shackles? well, he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf-god tengri (or some such name) and tengri sets him free by magic. yeah, right.why does he want to become ruler of the mongols? the wolf-god again, apparently. off goes temudjin to ask for guidance, and -- surprise! surprise! -- he gets it. "laws," he says to himself. "what the mongols need are laws. good, simple ones." golly, it was impressive.and then finally, how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? better tactics, certainly, but also through the aid of the good old wolf-god again, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. all the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (mongols are scared of thunder, you see) -- but not our temudjin. the troops, completely wowed by his bravery, acclaim him king! i don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. the funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk, dirt and violence. it's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.there's heaps of violence in graphic close-up: slashings, impalings, spouts of blood, sprays of blood, clouds of blood -- the blood guys had a great time, actually. despite the realism, it's impossible to take seriously.i must mention the ludicrous cgi final battle scene. how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. they don't. oh, and it's all shot in the standard hollywood style -- breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close-up stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. and the standard dolby super-sound-effects of whumps and thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain tension.tedious.avoid.

first of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of mongolian music. well, the horses looked mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was mongolian in it. oh, borte is played by a mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. but she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.but, i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by mr.bodrov. the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion. there was no logic behind the development of the plot. in fact, there was hardly any story at all, just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in "mongolian" clothes, speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian. most actors were either japanese, russian or chinese, most scenes were shot in china, kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a "mongolian". the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow. the battle scenes are laughable. all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story.the japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. he looked sleepy, soft, stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie.and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste. to see chinggis-khan half of the movie as a slave, to see his two first kids be born from other men, to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant... my blood starts to boil. and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha? one could make a great movie out of it. where is the story of the rise of temujin? of his childhood, of his relationship with his family, with his brothers, of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family? where is van khan, who helped him a lot? where is the depiction of life in the steppe, of the life of the nomads, of their traditions, of their relations with the other nations around them?where is development of the characters? we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important, how temujin became chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. all this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.

i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad, it's 4:3 aspect ratio film, and it just keeps getting worse, the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable, i was like watching the movie and said to myself: this going to happen next and guess what happened? right...if you want to see a good action boxing movie, don't watch this one you'll end disappointed on this low-budget movie like i did. go and see ali its way better!

it's about time for a female boxing flick, but this one ain't it. though the acting isn't too bad, the predictable storyline and silly dialogue pretty much ruin this one from the get go. to top it off, the boxing scenes display zero tension. come on! how hard is it to make a boxing match seem exciting??!!

well, i fell for it. i saw the box for this at the video store, and mistook it for "girlfight", which i'd heard was great. in my own defense, the titles are similar, and they re-did the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical. anyway, to sum it up, they obviously re-did the whole cover packaging/promo to capitalize on the buzz/success of "girlfight". i popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straight-to-video flicks, and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie, which sounded like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main feature. when i saw the first few minutes and maria conchita alonso showed up, i knew i'd fallen for it. (don't get me wrong, she's a talented actress, but i knew she wasn't in "girlfight", the movie i'd been under the false impression i was renting).so, apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer, the movie was ok. the plot involves belle, a young latino woman who is the daughter of an ex-champion boxer. one of her close friends is a female boxer, who--and i could see all this coming sooo far ahead of time it was really a drag--gets seriously injured during a match with a mean champ named "the terminator", who resembles a female version of a bigger, more pumped up ike turner. of course, belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend. she lives with her caring, supportive yet protective dad (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who just happens to be a cop. her love interest, also caring and supportive yet protective, is also a cop who works with her dad. hmmm, they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty...wonder what's gonna happen? she starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course, pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her. the actor they hired looks like a very low-rent cary eweles and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache. his acting was also really, really bad. i'm not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen rocky, or almost anyone, knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end.this was not a completely terrible movie. most of the acting was ok, and the lead actress was very good. there were good, strong female latino role models. the final fight scene did get me sort of interested, even though i knew everything that was going to happen long before it did. the actress that played "the terminator" did a great job of being unlikeable enough that i really did want belle to kick her a$$, and rooted for belle-again, although there were absolutely no surprises. my favorite moment (maybe the only moment where i wasn't mad at myself for renting the movie by mistake) was when belle slaps her sleazy manager after he's shown his true colors, yells at him, and then turns away only to suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear, showing that she is really the one in charge.the dialogue was really, really bad, my main complaint. one of their attempts to be witty was someone discussing boxing saying "size doesn't matter" and the female replying wryly, "now where have i heard that before?" other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are "the doctors told me i may never walk again!" "come on, you know you can trust me!" and "your mother would have been so proud of you". i could go on and on. nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soap operas or movies-of-the-week. maybe i'm being too mean-the filmmakers did make an effort, and i did sit through the whole thing voluntarily...but only because there was nothing else to watch while i worked out. you could do worse (especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters) but you could also do much, much better.

this is, in simple terms, one of the worst films ever made. the story goes way beyond being tasteless and judging by the actors performance, they know it. there just in not one single redemming quality of this film. patrick swayze will have to overcome some major obstacles in his career, before people forget about this turkey.

updating of the clare booth luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment. the cast of women is excellent, most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together. there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common, but at the same time its just as timely as ever, i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot. wait for cable.

no! no - no - no! my entire being is revolting against this dreadful remake of a classic movie. i knew we were heading for trouble from the moment meg ryan appeared on screen with her ridiculous hair and clothing - literally looking like a scarecrow in that garden she was digging. meg ryan playing meg ryan - how tiresome is that?! and it got worse ... so much worse. the horribly cliché lines, the stock characters, the increasing sense i was watching a spin-off of "the first wives club" and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery room. how many times have i seen this movie? only once, but it feel like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh about it. for shame!

saw this movie last night. i don't usually comment good or bad, as i think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different, tastes vary, yadda yadda. this movie was bad. by the end i thought, oh my, this is testing my patience. how many women really look and live like this when they hit "rock bottom" and if i could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams - gosh, life would be great! i was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl (my darling hubby likes watching movies together and i knew this wouldn't be his thing), something light and easy on the senses, but this was one bad movie. we are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasn't that. annette benning is a great actress, she held her own. bad. bad.

anatomie isn't very unique in horror genre, in fact it isn't even scary at all. it reminds me of its american cousins, horror slashers. it's just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a german movie it's just too american with nothing to add to it.actually anatomie is too predictable and boring, its plot is not intact and consistent. it's got stupid scenes to it which don't even fit into a horror movie genre. amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. why do they need to have it all in just one movie? they should have made a cheap german adult movie instead.i can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just too boring.

1st watched 6/24/2007 - 4 out of 10(dir-stefan rujowitzky): ok thriller, but a little too predictable. this story is based in germany, which is also where the movie is made. it is about a young medical student who gets a shot to go to a premiere school in heidelberg and arrives seeing some strange things occurring. someone she met on the train there and saved, shows up on the school's experimentation table and she's suspecting foul play right away. she does some investigation and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called aaa(and no it's not alcoholics anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-hippocratic oath and is used to perform experimentations on live people that doctor's wouldn't normally be able to do. she finds out her grandfather(who was a dean at the school) was a big part of establishing it and it's pretty readily filled by members of the school. it's an interesting story but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what's going on and then it's kind of a horror movie with the heroine fighting off the bad boy of the group that's taking things to the next psychotic level. although this movie was made in europe, it plays to a young american audience with it's focus on gore, sex and the horror film premise(which is really it's big downfall) and explains why it probably made good money and spawned a sequel but doesn't necessarily make for a good movie.

okay, i had reasonably high expectations for this. the controversial subject matter was a good concept. as a horror fan i admit i was fascinated and very excited about this.it turns out they had a great idea, but it was terribly executed. let's see. this movie seems to run in 3 modes: happy, sex and dark. the problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be. the "happy" parts i believe were meant to contrast with the "dark" parts, but it doesn't work. the soundtrack is one of the reasons.the movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly, i can't even begin to say how much the directing and editing suck. there's sex in the most unappealing and unerotic way. i'm not complaining but even for horror standards they were unnecessary and filler.the characters are all unlikeable with the exception of paula (potente). her friend from munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies i've come across recently.there's a bit of plot which i won't go into detail... it's not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. there's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on. don't try to understand everything because there are giant plot holes here.it's all so shoddily done that you don't care for the victims, the perpetrators, anyone. and to think this could have been great. i can say one good thing about it which is, the movie shed some light on today's unethical medical procedures. with genetics and controversial sciences advancing, this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions. but you won't find that here, just a series of scenes loosely pasted together with people and things that you don't care about.skip this and go watch flatliners instead, you're welcome.3/10

there is an endless supply of trashy horror movies. it seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill. alas, very seldom these attempts succeed. this, unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value. the story is highly predictable, most of the actors very uninspired, or just plainly miscast, special effects of very low quality. it took a lot of effort not to switch off the dvd and go to bed. with such a limited number of foreign movies issued in the usa, why in the world would anybody want to import this drivel. to top it all, apparently there is an "anatomy 2 ", for those who have nothing better to do. i'd rather watch the paint dry.

this movie had such a good premise to start with. suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie.but it contained so many dumb clichés from the worst of the old american slasher/horror movies. now, i love slasher/horror movies, but there are all the old clichés that have long disappeared from american cinema. for example, the old "i hear noises in the basement and i'm home all alone and the basement light doesn't work, so i'll go down to investigate" cliché.three examples of these clichés just really irked me to no end: 1) when potente finds out that there may be a secret society at work at the medical school carving up live bodies, she proceeds to ask questions and tell everyone -- very publicly. in essence, she is saying, "i found you out. come kill me because i am telling everyone your secret." and then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over her bed and is brought her roommate's severed finger in a towel.2) even after one guy she met two weeks ago ends up on the dissection table and she finds out about this secret society disemboweling live people, she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are stored 2-3 more times by herself at night to investigate.3) her roommate gets killed. she gets chased by the killer, whom she knows, doesn't report him to the university or the police, then leaves the school to go home to visit her parents. then she returns to school, apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let bygones be bygones and not try to kill her, even though she knows his secret. she was, of course, wrong.for someone who was supposed to be so smart (she was studying to be a doctor in the best school in germany), she acted like the cliché bimbo in a horror movie.these things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating, and made me wish the ending would come even sooner. halfway through the movie, i stopped routing for her and wished that she would end up on the dissection table, too.

medical student paula henning wins a place at an exclusive heidelberg medical school. when the body of a young man she met on the train turns up on her dissection table, she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, and uncovers a gruesome conspiracy perpetrated by an antihippocratic secret society operating within the school. disturbing and gross, lots of scary parts. it even has a good script and ending. but it has a one poor part. what else could you see from this movie? it's a good mystery and horror movie. but, of course, if you like it, go buy it. if you don't, there still is not reason to waste your money on this.rated r for extreme graphic violence, sexual situations and profanity.

firstly, this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing. i really did not like seeing all these scenes where people get cut up alive, etc. the weirdly erotic introduction gives one a sense of necrophiliactic wonder. it is somewhat... distastefull to me personally. but the movie really works in that respect, and it is suppposed to be scary, so i give it credit for that. yup, a few points there for those scalpels and....well, damned disturbing idea of getting disected alive.but what this movie lacks is an interesting plot, characterization, or real surprises. the whole teen-flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple, predictable way. lots of 'tense' moments, creepy guys who are insane, and the big question of all: is the boyfriend the murderer? this movie fits into the category of "scream" and countless others which have spawned over the 90s. well, i won't spoil it for you, but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer. we find out who it is half way through... and from there on, the movie drudges on, trying to fill in some time... rather boringly to say the least. i was looking at the clock a bit on this movie.the lead actress is great, as usual, but the carboard acting box she is placed into makes one groan in pain... the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane, but she is the one who really knows whats going on. and the cops? ahhh, they just laugh and eat donuts. very predictable, flat, disturbing at times, and most of all, boring and dull... it's like an american film company took a flight to germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign..... hmmm..... or did they?

i was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie, and finally an european one. so, maybe my expectations were to high.it begins with a good quiet horror/shock sequence but it lets you down right away in the following scenes, where the plot begin being introduced, as the acting and the motivation/life of the characters reveals itself no better than any 'made for tv' drama. it keeps that way right into the end.about the horror part of the movie, it is certainly a good idea and a different one, but all the scenes are of the 'seen it before' kind.overall, my idea of this movie was that it had a good concept, which was inserted into a mediocre story, bad acting and less than tolerable plot holes.

so after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the final fantasy series, final fantasy: advent children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. and the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. however, if you haven't played ff7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. of course, for ff7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. one last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed. if you played and enjoyed ff7 than it is a worthwhile watch, though nothing too special. if you have not played ff7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.

i give this movie a 4 cause i'm a die hard fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in cg form sephiroth's still coolnow the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting i've ever seen(i've watched epic movie)the movie just seems cloud orientated so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that. clouds mentioned so much that it make you not want to see him in this movie the villains have the award for the worst villains ever (i was more scared by the wicked witch of the west) all the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie for a nod to the fans and doesn't take it further then thatwtf's with the chilly chally???summary: waited 9 years for this movie and this is what i get a large pointless and boring cut scene i beg the head of square cenix to shoot the man responsible for this burn every copy of the movie and any one involved in it and create a new movie from the ashes's (it would be nice to make the movie in live action and based on the original game)

pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie. and that is precisely what happened here.first off, let me admit, i am yet to play ffvii (i intend to order it soon). however, i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story. however, not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this, and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is required.in spite of incredible visuals, i can't say there is too much thats new. we've seen it in final fantasy: the spirits within, and apart from some better movement, i can't say they've done lots of super-daring stuff with this.the fight scenes - well, they are a bit of fun. still, how could we ever doubt the result of any of them. this one was boringly classic - there were three fights with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, cloud, gets smashed, then he almost gets there and gets smashed, and then finally wins). the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal, but in this case is poorly executed. i'll touch on that later.the english dub seemed fine to me, though i didn't watch it in japanese, so i shan't judge the japanese dub, but only the english one. i'll say this - i've heard plenty of better ones, even in my limited repertoire.and now, the plot. ummm... what plot? let me be frank, this movie is nought but a fan service, a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy. as i said earlier, the fights seem to just happen for no reason. the opening fight is never explained, kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty. cloud sits around moping for the entire film, and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameo.really, ffvii was an ensemble piece. advent children is anything but. if they'd managed to give everyone some significant story role (star trek: first contact proved it was possible, i might add), then this could have been a lot better. naturally, that would have changed the plot too, which, lets be honest, is almost set to be better than the one we got.characters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten. the members of avalanche (thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii, for those who don't know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of vincent valentine, and some get even less). hell, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that is pretty bad.the music... well, i don't care if nobuo uematsu is god himself, he botched this film big time. advent one winged angel was the only decent piece. otherwise, he couldn't decide whether to be epic (and orchestral) or fun (with electric guitar). when he switched from one to the other, you felt it as though he'd taken a sledgehammer to your head.and that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun... it tried to be both, and failed miserably. honestly, you can't please everyone and do everything. the movie also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three is too much), but failed here too. the last scene, which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony, was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it. you don't need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there. that scene just didn't belong in the film (and nor did aerith's frequent appearances - she's dead jim!).given just how fantastic i've heard final fantasy vii to be, this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment. because of the beautiful visuals, i give it a 2 out of 10.

final fantasy: advent children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong. instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, square enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. yes, i said "incomprehensible." did you know that tifa knows blindingly fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? that cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2-ton sword? the english dub is mediocre. while not egregiously bad, it is far from well-produced. the quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub.here is what i'd like to say to the die-hard ffvii fans who can't stop gushing over this movie: advent children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from square enix, but even a trashy cg flick like galerians: rion had a better story. you'll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time. the days of its novelty are numbered.movies like advent children make me question whether square enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. after all (and no offense), it's a japanese company. japanese developers can deliver fun games, but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow. they are utter psychos, however, when it comes to production quality. advent children features some of the most breathtaking renders in cg history, but that doesn't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters.any fan who followed this film knows sephiroth comes back. bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake.note: the one point i give this "film" is in honor of the 10,000 enslaved japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on cloud's effeminate caucasian head.

i was giddy with girlish-glee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits within.after years of anticipation, they gave november 2005 release date. well, november came. and went. followed by december. oh, look, today's january 31, 2006. no us release as of yet.oh well, i'm so glad i had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy. ;dwell, the cg was great. not as good as expected, but near perfect. i cringed, however, at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie. i had thought that we were passed this by now. also, i didn't really care for the anime look given to their faces. i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film, and yet most of the characters have larger-than-norm eyes, especially the girl characters. they had personality, though, i'll give them that.even though i'm not a big fan of anime, i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes. they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seat.for about the first two.and there-in lies advent children's biggest flaw. it's mostly just a bunch of hyper-stylized fight scenes.a ff7 sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years. instead, they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse it's just-under-two-hours running time.where final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this movie falls short. you don't really get to know the characters. the only way you'd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game. we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat.what hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of ff7 characters were given. they were nothing more than cloud's "i'll call if i need you, but i probably won't" back up singers. and, to add to the hurt, they had each character individually throw cloud higher and higher. this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off. i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own, ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higher.it hurt even more when they reduced the turks to less-than-just comic relief. that was fine for the game, but this is cinema. people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle. they took away their dignity :/and, spoiler (yeah right, most of you probably already know, anyhow). who remembers darth maul being hyped up in sw: episode 1? yeah, now, picture that, but with sephiroth. that's right. he had maybe 5 minutes of screen time. maybe that. end spoiler :pif this movie was made for the fans, then way to go square. if this is any indication of the direction you're taking the ff series, i doubt you're going to be seeing much of my money. i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters.you had a chance to make something epic. something truly beautiful, a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg films.instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together. way to go.and i'm sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg they'd know what i'm talking about. well, i was gonna rate this a 5/10, but after thinking about it while righting this, i'm giving it a 3/10 because they could have done better. they have done better. and this is just sad.if they're gonna remake anything ffvii, they need to do this one first.

first i will say that i am going to be as subjective as i can.there will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware.i hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review. this movie final fantasy 7 advent children, based off the ultra popular rpg (final fantasy vii) for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time. after the years of hype and the dozens of trailers (none of which i ever saw, i had only seen stills) this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. i myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself. so i had thought to myself, "what could go wrong?".well, the movie started out ok in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed. without a doubt, this is the best looking cgi animation around, but that won't help a weak plot, undeveloped characters,and over indulgent action scenes. here is the story basically. these three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of sephiroth (he's the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones)are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well, probably to make an army (of kids?) they also center some of the story on some kid named denzel, i don't know who this kid is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. so the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration.so now cloud must save the day from these guys. apparently cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight, i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time. maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible. the real problem of this movie is logic. now i know what you are gonna say, "but it's called final fantasy! it should have those ideas in it!" well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that context. context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, i could explain it all, but if i did, i would end up writing the screenplay.also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite. like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans. they show up, do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story.if this is too long here is the simpler review-the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunningthe cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?) horrible endingbig time spoiler-now the ending of this movie really disappointed me. they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest. then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.not that the movie doesn't have it's moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.other than that it's not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling.

when the spirits within was released, all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like final fantasy. this is a different story, for better or worse. the familiar settings, characters, music, story, and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. the problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right.the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy, switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic, but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing.the cg itself is exceptional, but i can't say it's the best i've ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters, although i must admit that advent children's characters moved much more naturally.the plot is virtually a black hole. it's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring sephiroth back for one last fight. old characters reappear, but serve no real purpose other than to please fans. character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end. but it's packed with neat-looking fight scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans wanted anyway.in the end, advent children is a very flashy, but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy vii than a real sequel.by the way, don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting not useful. it just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys/fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly.

i really like kinski he is a great actor. i've seen this movie because i've heard that there are autobiographic aspects in this movie.the film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow-pictures at the walls. then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: "a kid sells fortune, but her box is empty now." this is really disturbing and wasn't really necessary, because everyone understands what this movie is all about. the movie shows how kinski's character treated woman, and how he kept them under control. if there are really some aspects of kinski's life in this story - then he really was an swine. so there is no need to watch this movie, unless if you want to see kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies to laugh about.

this film is sometimes called 'the story of o-pt.2',which tries to pass itself off as a sequel (of sorts)to the french erotic s&m thriller 'the story of o'. although i've never seen the original version, i did, however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual & social politics. i guess the 'o' angle comes from the occasional s&m overtones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to watch) as the ones in 'mistress'. klaus kinski is the only recognizable face in this french/japanese production (but speaks his lines in english--at least in the version i saw). the unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious (what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water?). it's obvious that after the whole "porno chic" trend in cinema petered out (ouch-sorry,bad pun!)about 1975, producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema,not to mention foreign/art cinema,so film goers had to contend with dreck like 'the last woman',and others like it.

i bought this film on dvd despite the "stale" review and that was idiotic... that review was completely accurate and i have never seen any worse "erotic" film in my long life! even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings, plus a nice cover... but my own extreme erotica (c) films are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times of this films budget! the story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book... or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments... then did the main male character - klaus kinski - not look a bit like the second master of "o" he try to play... and not even lovely arielle dombasle, did look delicious in any scene!

this is one of the worst films i have seen in a while.the problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film, 'artistic' or an exercise is eroticism. as a result it fails on all accounts.the acting is atrocious, the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointless.klaus kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing. sure he has an intense and 'unique' look but ultimately he can't actually act. just look at how he reacts when his mistress leaves....really don't watch this film, some say it needs repeat viewings i say one is too many.

this movie tries to be artistic but comes across as puerile as a film school student's first attempt. next it tries to be erotic but comes across as clumsy as a virgin's first attempt. lastly it tries to be cruel & gripping, but aside from kinski's performance--which is powerful but conspicuously misplaced amidst the amateur melodrama--it's about as gripping as your hand around a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering how un-erotic this film is). it features a blowjob scene which is even lamer than chloë sevigny's career-burying performance in the brown bunny. run away now while you have the chance. go find yourself a victoria's secret lingerie catalogue instead--it's more artistic and more erotic than this tripe.

the premise of this movie is ugghhhh. the guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "yeah, this is funny, cute, and a good movie." what the hell?!?! what is funny about immature girls fornicating with a married man with a new baby? what is cute about the fact that he is cheating on his wife? what have been wrong with them finding some teenage boys to have sex with before starting college? noooo, that is not good enough, the guy has to be married, off-limits, off-the-market, that's the one we gotta have. dumb-ass girls! then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the guy. no, she just "loves" the way he makes her feel. two of the girls are having fun with it, they think it is funny and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they are doing. it just shameless, but yeah this is all good with everyone one this website. the dark-haired girl even has the audacity to have her dad pick her up from the guys house, under the ruse of baby sitting. this is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife? poor woman working and paying the bills while he screws the baby sitter.

this movie is worse than "heaven's gate" or "plan 9 from outer space". don't know why it got even one oscar, it should have gotten a million raspberries, just like the audiences that either walked out or didn't show up in the first place. the hospital was a first-rate financial failure, but i'm certain the elite classes of left-wing, gutter-mouthed intellectuals railed that the american public was far- too plebeian to appreciate biting social-commentary when they saw it, and on and on. george c scott, in one of most-artless and embarrassing roles, along with aging sex-symbol diana rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasingly-blasé manner as they push along a silly plot. poor old george is impotent and is just crushed by the event, but after lots of dirty language between him and rigg, he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy, crumbling nyc hospital that looks so disgusting that i wouldn't want a dying pet rat treated in it. there's also some sacrilegious junk-dialog tossed about hither and yon, laced with plenty of cussing as well. it ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest. never want to see another minute of this awful movie again.

i'm amazed that "the hospital" has been so well-received by the critics and the public. i found it dreary, visually ugly and generally meaningless. after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes, the film does improve (relatively), but it remains way too far-fetched (not to mention unfunny) to be successful as a satire, and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. the film's uncertain tone is its biggest fault, overshadowing even scott's terrific (as usual) performance.

i have to ask myself, do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and critiquing it? how can something so awful score this high? my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids, anything with an r in it until we were old enough. i only remember two films that had them saying yech! when they got home. this one, and "catch-22".the movie is comprised of bumbling physicians and staff in a filthy hospital, rambling narratives, and a pack of inner city people (who look like rejects from a 1970s norman lear sitcom) staging a protest. the worst part is the "murder mystery", a crazy old guy doing "god's work" by killing doctors and others. when he confesses, scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. they only care about him getting out of there where he will "be safe and happy". a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is faked as the man so he can get away. oh, my, what a fun movie.this movie didn't "make me think", chuckle, or have any other feeling other than "it must get better", but it never does. people wonder why it was a failure, no wonder here. i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good. yech.

cowardly and cynical, `the hospital' represents the nadir of paddy chayefsky's special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire.thanks to ham-handed director arthur hiller, this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly, poorly paced presentation it deserves.only a great performance by george c. scott, in the sort of mean-spirited role he was born to play, keeps `the hospital' from being a complete disaster.ironically, though, scott's performance does viewers a disservice. his magnetism keeps them watching when they might more profitably turn off the vcr and clean out the closets, stare at the clouds, or watch re-runs of `baywatch.'certainly, anyone who emotionally invests in the set-up _ modern medicine apparently gone amok _ will feel cheated by the dismal payoff, where chayefsky reveals that the system works just fine, so quit your carping.while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy, it all turns out to be a red herring. before that becomes clear, though, chayefsky gives some good lines to scott as his middle-aged, middle-class, white male stand-in.bitter, alcoholic, impotent, scott's dr. herbert bock has alienated those who know him best, and he has the bile to keep alienating them. in chayefsky's worldview, all that of course makes bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his age.playing a collection of adjectives, the long-haired, long-legged, braless and almost bust-less diana rigg struggles in the part of `the girl.' the british rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress would struggle as well. like the rest of a good cast gone to waste, rigg can't overcome a script that isn't interested in any character except bock, or any philosophy beyond banality.for fans of george c. scott, this is another star turn and worth watching. for fans of black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. for anyone else, don't bother.

it's okay ... a few years later chayefsky's classic "network" will be his true cinematic big home run ..., but for now, this dark comedy isn't the classic it aspires to be. it's mostly awful, although it has some good scenes: the first murder victim being found, the e.r. clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery, drummond's delusional confessional, and the very last scene where scott's character regains his professional integrity and self-respect. it also has some ludicrous scenes: scott's character's whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist, scott's character's raping rigg's character, dysart's horrible mugging in his brief scenes, and the o.r. doctor pouncing on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because "i already have one malpractice lawsuit".chayefsky also tries too hard throwing every conceivable hurdle at this one hospital (i.e.- the murders, the administrative mistakes, the poor people protesting outside, etc). it might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole. acting-wise: scott is passable, rigg seems miscast, hughes is inspired, and dysart mugs through out his brief performance. the rest of the cast is too one-dimensional.

i just saw this stinky old boiler on tv. best watched with a very large flagon of dr jurd's jungle juice at hand, this exploitorific cheese-fest is hilariously bad. on the (very slim) plus side, raquel was in her physical prime, she looks good, and you get to see a fair bit of her, since she plays a go-go dancer; she had great legs, that's for sure. there's also some minor interest for screen buffs in the footage of los angeles ca. '69, and in spotting actors in minor parts who went on to better things. veteran thesp ron rifkin ('brothers and sisters') delivers a toe-curling early performances as "sailor" the "faggot junkie" barman who rats raquel out to the bad guy. you might also recognise the gun-toting security guard in the hit-and-run scene -- it's a very early appearance by gordon jump, who gave such a lovely performance in 'soap' as piece of chelief tinkler.the 'plot' of 'flareup', such as it is, follows the travails of an exotic dancer (welch) on the run from her murderous ex-husband (luke askew). this turkey is classic production-line hollywood sludge -- a paint-by-numbers script, pedestrian direction, hokey shots, edits and effects, ultra-cheesy stock music, plywood sets, and performances to match.the cast is as uniformly dreadful as the screenplay. although raquel is capable of fair performances in the right vehicle, this wheezy old clunker is so bad that she doesn't really stand a chance, and neither does the audience. one of my favourite moments occurs when raquel awakes up in the hospital, sees the vegas cop who's pursuing her murderous ex, and asks "how did you get here?" -- to which he of course replies "in a plane." oh the humanity ... and you won't be able to take your eyes off the doctor (michael rougas) who has what might well be one of the very worst walk-ons in the long sad history of bad cameos. i don't think i've ever seen anyone stand in one spot so badly before.raquel's love interest joe (james stacy) ambles through the film with a fixed look that's somewhere between bemused and embarrassed -- and no wonder. this bomb puts the cast through just about every made-for-tv cliché in the book, from raquel's spectacularly dreadful turn in the dreadful nightmare montage, to the pure schlock of the 'romantic' horse ride along leo carillo beach.**spoiler warning** -- just about the only interesting thing in the whole film is the denouement, in which raquel finally gets her own back, and hilariously enacts the title, by setting the baddie on fire. whoever the stunt guy was really earned his money on this one -- he goes up like yorba linda in a heatwave. yet even this fairly spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew moves into shot near the end.there are so many crappy things about 'flareup' that it's oddly compelling; i found yourself wondering if this could be one of the worst films i've ever seen made. the answer seemed to be a resounding 'yes' ... until i saw the film that followed it, roger corman's mega-trashy 'caged heat' classic 'the big doll house', which takes awful to a whole new level. i can heartily recommend these two shlockers as a double-bill. you'll laugh yourself silly.

after nearly getting killed by a big dog, a stray cat thinks to herself, "why can't i be a skunk? then everyone would leave me alone." she looks around the junkyard and gets an idea: white paint, black paint and some limburger cheese and some garlic......hmmmm. the next thing you know, we have the forerunner to "pepe le pew," although in this cartoon, she's still a cat, she's a she, and just a skunk in disguise. the cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a smelly skunk. he's a happy, content guy now.....until a real skunk (with the charles boyer imitation voice) shows up! i did appreciate the cat putting on a bugs bunny outfit. however, overall i never cared for these french-takeoff characters, finding the stereotypical dialog overdone and not really funny, so i only rate this as "fair." i do this a point, however, for the moral at the end of the story.

chuck jones's 'odor-able kitty' is the cartoon that introduced pepe le pew to the world sort of. there are a few key differences between the pepe we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. for one, the disguised cat who pepe amorously pursues in 'odor-able kitty' is distinctly male. also, pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is henry at the cartoon's climax, his french accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the put-upon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. for the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a pepe le pew cartoon but pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. he is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. in fact, 'odor-able kitty' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every pepe le pew cartoon that followed. this subsequent development has robbed 'odor-able kitty' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull pepe le pew short with a weird surprise ending. as a child, i hated pepe le pew. as an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqué humour, i love the character and most of his cartoons. 'odor-able kitty' makes me feel like a child again!

my guess is that the producers of this low-budget space/horror film wanted a serious movie but the director had his heart set on a parody. so...this is what we get. set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and peopled with characters and props right out of the 90's. the set is some industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker, whatever. they use is as is so the controls consist racks of old tv equipment. one location is obviously the employees lunchroom and sports an old tv and vcr as well as a water cooler with plastic demijohn. tiny lister and coolio get the best lines, arguing throughout the story. the dialog is packed with terms that are pretty dated even now ("a-ok, daddy-o") but then maybe the 30th century is very retro? when the captain declares the ships cargo is a load of coffins from "the transylvania station" you know this is all a put-on. its a bit of alien, part jasonx, shameless rip-off of all the best sci-fi and horror titles. at one point casper vandien even tells his pilot to "make it so" with a straight face. this film would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire but they keep attempting to make the story serious....maybe the backers were on the set that day. anyway, not a bad boredom killer if you aren't too picky. fx are as good as the sets are bad.

i normally like casper in his movies, a real credit to starship troopers. but the box cover on this video ssooooo mi-sleds the renters. at my local video, people rent it expecting a (perhaps) borg like vampire, and instead they get a bad re-make of lon chaney. it had great potential, and fell very flat. ireally think i could have written a better story line and screen play. why is it in every science fiction movie, they (the cast) constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy? didn't any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class? it is a pet pevee of mine, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a whole bunch of solar systems. it is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs. makes it sound even dumber.

this was on scifi this past weekend, and i had to check it out. after all... it was science fiction, with vampires and erika eleniak. what could go wrong with this b-movie?a lot.to start with: it can't even be classified as a "b-movie," because that would put it in the same league as roger corman... and this movie doesn't even meet his expectations. the most money they spent was on the contact lenses for the vampires.secondly: the casting was horrible. yes, casting udo kier as the captain of the demeter was a smart move... but the director clearly couldn't even get kier to memorize his lines. casting eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a smart move because it means a bunch of horny guys are going to buy/rent/record this flick to watch her get seduced by a vampire. but, the director, writer and producer screwed that one, too. granted, they got some money out of the poor, unfortuate souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with hot women in them... but no one is going to remember this movie in another two or three years.thirdly: little things that just emphasize the laziness in this movie. for example, van helsing calls a cross a "crucifix," and, when mina is staked in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see the fact that her "chest" is nothing more than pillows.oh, and one other thing: why did they go for the george hamiltion-type dracula instead of something that would look decently scary? does george hamilton have an overwhelming hold on our future? why didn't everyone who saw dracula just laugh at him for his get-up?a waste of time. even with a tivo remote in your hand.

this is my first comment on a movie in here. i have to say that of all the bad films i ever seen, including braindead for an example, this is really worse! i promise. don't even look at it. it is boring, bad acting, bad script and plot, bad effects the whole movie is one big piece of crap! if i could i would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest is 1 which is awful, i need to vote that. but i would say the movie is worse than awful.don't pain yourself by seeing this movie and hoping it will get better because i can tell you already now, it wont! i hoped that there might would come one single scene which would be worth watching. there didn't came any good scene at all. what an excellent piece of crap. and coolio as a vampire? lol! lmao! yargh!

ok with coolio in it i should have known better! but noooooooo.within 3 mins you've encountered 5 bites from other movies & and tv shows...8 mins casper van dien should have learnt by now! 10 mins you're feeling sorry for tom 'tiny' lister jr. that he has been reduced to doing movies like this.15 mins erika eleniak shows up looking like zena.20 mins you're ready to shoot you're self...how these movies receive funding is beyond me! and yes i watched the whole thing. the ending is priceless!!! just stay away!

hmmm! is it worst film ever? well sort of, for some of the cast its a shame to see them in such a film but hey if it pays the bills why not, as for the film well. ok cg effects not to bad for such a cheap film ,music is just about ok again for a cheap film, end credits are ok lolbad to many to list but, cast, acting, sets, script, ending..what the hell ,drac..........worst drac ever!, many more but can not be bothered to put them all down.idea was ok but needed ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and change all bad points, i do say however to see this film so you to can say"what the fu%$ was that all about"as the credits run.also its kind of a must see just to see how bad it is.

my original comment on this particular title was deleted, by a imdb user or the staff, only because i just happen to dislike this film to the point i had to sincerely write what i felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film. where's my freedom of word?obviously this movie was made by students, 'cos so lame and amateurish it felt. of course even they have to start from somewhere? the script was incoherent mess and so was the acting. with low budget and b- class actors, what can you expect? there's some cgi in places, so poor, it looks like done with an old pc. some may say, this is sort of an "alien" clone, only this time it's dracula (in a vintage costume) who's sucking the other cast dry, one by one. the sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large space craft. it would be fun to know what the stars (erika eleniak, casper van dien, coolio and udo kier) thought about the film after it was released... coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever!it was a total waste of my time and money, don't know why i even bothered to rent this flick. honestly, i just hate this film. with uwe boll's house of the dead, dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever. (well, i've seen even worse than these two)avoid! any other film will do better.

...and that's a goddamn shame! please make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of dracula 3000. this must be the worst vampire-flick of the new millennium so far (i haven't seen reign in darkness yet, but they don't get much worse than this). don't be fooled be the movie's cool h.r. gigeresque cover. this is so bad, it's almost hilarious. i can't describe all the emotions this movie conjured. i laughed my ass off, i yelled at the screen, i sat there numb, nodding my head in disbelief,... this film has 'cheap & cheese' written all over it. the best thing of this movie are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less okay cgi of two space-ships. but when casper van dien's voice-over comes on, you start smelling something fishy. and, indeed, it all goes downhill rapidly after that.the crew of a salvage-spaceship finds an abandoned vessel, the demeter, which seems to be heading for earth. they enter it, thus sealing their fate. this movie is, above all things, a shameless low-budget alien-rip-off, mixed with vampires. right down to the plot-twist were erika eleniak's character, aurora, reveals she's a robot. coolio goes badly over-the-top as the dope-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pffff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). casper van dien's character's named capt. van helsing (hahaha!) and he looks like...,er well, casper van dien. udo kier as capt. varna, former commander of the demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor udo, what where you doing in this flick?). and then we have langley kirkwood as count orlock, one of the most pathetic and laughable dracula's ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. just look at his outfit. instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he's wearing a cheap old-school halloween-suit with fringes. you thought richard roxburgh was unconvincing as dracula in van helsing? then wait until you see langley's performance!the set-designers went overboard on this one. the interior of the demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. the prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and "prof" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. it has to be pushed around in order to move.aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. and the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: humvee and aurora are the only survivors. instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. then aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a "protheus 3.2 pb", in other words: a pleasure-bot. so she says "well then, what are you waiting for". humvee answers "ain't gotta tell me twice. come on, girl", picks her up and... "boooooom!!!" the ship explodes and credits roll. no sex-scene, no erika flashin' her boobies, no bloody climax,... just one more shot of udo kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.so, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but i must warn them: it gets really painful at times. and everyone claiming that van helsing, underworld or even queen of the damned is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just hasn't seen dracula 3000 yet.

oh dear gods, this is awful. stay away, just stay away. if you think you've seen bad movies, think again. never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after i watched this movie. the acting, if it is allowed to be called that, is enough to cause internal bleedings inside your head. the story is so thin it is just barely there... no wait, scratch that. there is not a complete story there, but once in a while, there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of horribleness, and believe me, those few lines should have been shot. the best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it, and watch the cozy fire from a distance.some may call me sarcastic in this review, but i am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache. however, should you be, what i like to call, a visual masochist (like myself), please, go right ahead and watch this monstrosity.

imagine the worst thing that could ever possibly be conceived by human intellect. now imagine something infinitely darker - i mean, worse, than that. then multiply that by the quantity of the suckiness possessed by the star wars holiday special. this movie is by far worse than that."dracula 3000: infinite darkness", starring such illustrious and reputable actors such as coolio and langley kirkwood (as the film's "horrifying antagonist", count orlock) is equatable to eating one's own feces exclusively for one's entire life, condensed into approximately one hour and twenty minutes. to be frank, there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy - riddled with communist propaganda, promotion of drug use, futuristic anachronisms, and quite possibly the worst special effects since the (original) "war of the worlds".the hammer and the sickle of the soviet union can be seen proudly displayed throughout the dingy sets they dare call a spaceship. lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the "film". and of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries by then. so they don't know who this "god" is, even though they have no reservations about using his name in vain. but of course, in the socialist republic of space (presided over by interstellar president baker), death-stick like drugs are legalized and quite common. yet handicap mobility seems even worse off than it is today (they don't even have a wheelchair ramp).racial tension still festers throughout the galaxy in quite a familiar/predictable fashion. we receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as "is dracula a brotha?", "us brothas gotta stick together", and "once you go black, you don't go back." speaking of the token black characters, one is played by coolio. playing a stereotypical stoner, coolio becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever. oh wait, second most ridiculous vampire ever. that prized title goes to our friend count orlock, from planet transylvania, in the carpathian system. these two make quite a pair, between coolio's attempts to cripple a paraplegic, strange attempts at making high-pitched animal noises, a hairstyle 1004 years old, and gigantic stretches of completely worthless dialogue; and count orlock's twenty dollar generic halloween-style vampire costume, exploding coffins, or confusingly inane back story.one wonders if they did not simply give coolio the opportunity to get "as high as a kite in space without gravity", let him interact with the other "actors", and just went from there.count orlock's motivations are also somewhat in question. does he want "infinite darkness", as the film's subtitle would have you believe? does he want to eat the crew? or does he want *coolio* to "kill them all"? or does he desire to give handicapped people a chance in such an inhospitably future? it doesn't really matter, because none of this film's plot makes sense anyways.the highlight of this movie has to be it's ending. more for the fact that it means the movie is over than by any merit of the abrupt trainwreck of a climax they phone in before the credits. instead of facing count orlock off in some sort of duel (the closest we get is a shot of orlock flailing around at breakneck speeds in front of our protagonist, who dies shortly afterwards), our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary door. orlock then proceeds to collapse, screeching in pain at a totally mundane yet understandably painful injury. this is by far the most fun you'll get from this movie. watching a vampire's contorted face as he cries in pain will have you on the edge of your seat - with laughter. almost worth the four bucks for that alone. of course, right after that we're treated with one of the film's worst one-liners, the mandatory allusion to sex, and perhaps the most abrupt excuse for an ending *ever*. they're driving into the sun, and their ship literally just blows up before they even come remotely close to impact. i think they just outdid the wachowski bros. for the worst finale ever.i can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible. secure in this fact, we can safely say that this is the worst movie ever created, and one which will never be exceeded in low quality, lower budget, and lower-est acting talent.

dracula 3000 or van helsing "dracula's revenge" (cheap cash in on another lame vampire flick) as i saw it is a master class in how not to make a movie. a rag tag collection of misfit salvager's board a previously lost cargo ship "the demeter" in the (cough) carpathian system (which later is upgraded to the carpathian galaxy) and awake a relentless evil (in this case the script). the film is a bizarre bastardization of event horizon and whatever the lamest vampire film of all time is.****spoliers follow**** after a plethora of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on, we open with a cheesy exposition type speech from casper (silly name) who plays captain abraham van helsing (sillier name) and in lieu of actual character development, goes on to describe the twisted, unintelligible oddities that make up his crew. van helsing himself sports a spray on stubble and wears a body warmer throughout in a sort of retro 80's tribute to han solo (i guess). now and again the captain of the demeter pops up in some sort of mad video diary to tell us nothing of consequence in a pronounced german accent (subtitles sadly not included). crewmember mina boards the derelict ship (alone???) armed only with a gun shaped torch and thick east-european accent while conversing with van helsing on his ships bridge (which is basically a single glittery wall). mina wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, encounters what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak who continually glides by the camera. why this happens as the vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained. this leads on to a shaky camera chasing mina down the hallways until she runs into humvee. it's possible will smith could have been drafted in to write humvee's lines as most of them consist of humvee reminding us he is black every ten seconds and saying the word "ass" enough for a guinness book of records entry while delivering all this in a "from da hood" accent (this is the year 3000, does "da hood" even exist?) one of the main problems with this film is that it insanely tries to pretend its set in the year 3000. unfortunately anyone with healthy eyes won't buy this, as the demeter looks suspiciously like a soviet style ocean going tanker. possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of lenin next to a bunch of lockers and explain it away as some sort of futuristic communist comeback special. the crew's clothes look as if they were raided from a oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and they are armed to the teeth with latest in 20th century automatic weapons (with added year 3000 zing when fired) which of course are absolutely no use against vampires. healthcare is a thing of the past (in the future) as the simpering professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair??? my god what happened to all that genetic engineering stuff.the professor is an interesting character as he is a direct rip off from alien resurrection who had their own rag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair (who oddly wasn't killed). fans didn't take to prof as he appears scared in a lot of scenes if i were entombed in a non-wheelchair access soviet ship pursued by bad acting vampires, and everyone left me because i was such a whining wimp, i'd be scared too.during the un-dramatic mina chase scene the prof informs us (with feeling) "this is disconcerting". the rest of his lines are also disconcerting "bugger", and "we're all going to die" x 100, follows.erika eleniak appears as the vice captain (what happened to 1st officers?) in what i thought would be the tired, standard issue, hard nosed, no nonsense, "don't eye me up unless i tell you too", beat up 10 stuntman at one time super-babe, but this is a z-flick so she basically wears a tight low cut top and even tighter leather trousers. coolio's performance boosts the ham factor by 90% and is camper than a row of tents but luckily for us he dies soon enough. although he seems to keep his heart on the right hand side of his body.after a lot of running up and down the same corridor, using clunky soviet style controls, and sitting in soviet style locker rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship buggers off to find a more interesting crew (probably). why dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called orlock which is space transylvanian for "crimes against fashion" as he dandies about in a big puffy, frilly shirt and even bigger starched collar making hammer horror vampires look slick by comparison. orlock stops to explain his entire back story (off camera) to erica eleniak, but fails to kill her in another rip-off twist from alien resurrection. his back story is such a load of mince it's not worth repeating. as the budget can't afford fight coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee) and even proper end titles (the first cast list i saw, were same characters but completely different and italian names) the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with. the crew luckily are able to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure, millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy 20th century pool cues they find in the ship recreation room (up yours "holodeck"). the ending is awful and a little suspect, either they ran out of money or the ex-soviets demanded their ship back. i walked into this film knowing it was bad but oblivious as to how bad it really was.

greetings from lithuania.this is the first question that comes to head after watching this "movie". you know, i saw a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching this one, i only had two questions: 1) is this was just a parody (spoof) 2) how could people create such a thing!? if you never saw this "film", than you really don't know what is a really bad "film". i mean bad. the script - are you kidding my? acting is so horrible that i thing "the actors" where just having fun in this movie. i know, this is "b" movie, but come on?? is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage?? oh! and what an ending!!! a must miss ending! just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw, wait until the ending - because that kind of ending you have never saw before (and i hope you will never see). awoid this "movie" at any cost, and don't say i didn't warn you...

a space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space. the crew investigates, hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship. however, once aboard the ominous vessel, their own ship mysteriously disengages, leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or orloff as this creature calls himself.not a bad start. i mean it follows any number of typical sci-fi/horror plots. the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film. but, when you start with a fairly typical horror convention, the legend of dracula and vampires in general, and combine it with a fairly typical sci-fi convention, a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever they're forced to confront, the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staples.director darrell roodt, who also wrote dracula 3000 with ivan milborrow, is primarily responsible for this utter failure. so, no, roodt and milborrow have nothing up their sleeves but their arms.this film begins ominously enough, with a very poorly delivered voice over by caspar van dien, essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are. i should also point out that van dien's character is named van helsing. and, oh so very cleverly, this orloff character is from planet transylvania in the carpathian system. no kidding. i mean, come on guys, we get it. and, again, don't be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store.so, after van helsing's introduction of the crew, we have, essentially, a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about.i'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films. occasionally, they can be brilliant, see raimi's first two evil dead films. dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd stringers like, van dien, erika eleniak, coolio, etc. however, unlike, the evil dead flicks, there is no talent behind the camera. in front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but i'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt. it really seems like they don't know what to do. the best actor of the bunch, alexandra kamp-groenveld, gets killed off quickly and the ever-enjoyable udo kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal. grant swandby is also okay as the professor, but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair. and, yes, it's a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it. as for the rest of the actors, well.i'm sure coolio really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire, but, well, i don't think irritating qualifies as scary in most people's book. tiny lister and erika eleniak don't really provide much either. lister is never really more then the il' big brawny black stereotype. eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard. eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid thirties, but looks a little worn out and uninterested for the movie's duration.this brings us to count dracula/orloff played by langley kirkwood. to be honest, i can't recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be. he introduces himself as orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as count dracula as well. go figure. in any case, you will be absolutely astounded by just how lame this vampire is. have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time slots? yes, it's that bad. langley kirkwood, the actor playing orlock, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. i'm sure he's still getting hassled by his friends.there isn't much to the plot. the vampire is the last of it's kind and wants to go to earth, for some reason, and also, there is some lip service about wanting to defeat caspar van dien's character, van helsing. most of the crew get turned into vampires, including van helsing, and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine. yeah, that's right, bullets, and yes, the year 3000. keeping in that baffling vein, one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires, or vampire, since there is really never more then one threatening them, is filled with old soviet posters and insignia and such. what the? there are also references to god/religion being antiquated systems. but these references only confused me. did the soviet union make a comeback? is there some point roodt and milborrow want to make with this? it never really goes anywhere, seems dumb and the posters, etc. just look cheap.on the positive side, the film is competently shot and edited. the cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it's clearly done by professionals and, i had no problem with the special effects. the ships look like ships in outer space. although, as i write this, i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him. what were they thinking? why didn't someone say something? see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives? i guess, ultimately, that's the thing. whatever positives you try and grant this sci-fi/horror debacle, you become overwhelmed by it's lack of quality.poor udo kier.

the daytime tv of films. seldom have i felt so little attachment to characters. seldom have i been made to cringe by such dire dialogue. nauseous london thirty-somethings mincing round lurid bbc sets spouting platitudinous mulch. avoid this film as if it were your grandmother's clunge.

"go fish" garnered rose troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms. the entire film rings hollow. i cringed the whole way through.its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality. well not much more here to be learned than from "in and out". by now most of us actually do know, that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes. seldom has this revelation been portrayed on the screen with so little wit and style.pathetic.

i found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.the dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. the stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. as it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.apart from the attractive irish man - this film was a dud. and not even in a "so bad it's good way". the last 20 minutes were particularly painful. perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before, then this film might have something meaningful to say. otherwise - darlings, you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing.

this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b. its title promises far more than the film delivers. it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality. the people are agreeable, even the obligatory flamboyant type. the lead (kevin mckidd) overacts insofar as there's a reason for him to act at all. simon callow, playing a horny straight, is always worth watching, and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie. however, the rubbish about his men's group "meditations" or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order. they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non-stop inaction. the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip. don't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack. let the thing run; you won't miss anything. hugo weaving's character is superfluous. he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all. the outcome of that sequence isn't explained, and hugo's real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story. the movie is a total disappointment at the end, because there is no resolution. the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits. this is an interlude with no structure.

ok, so this film is well acted. it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. the straight man "deciding to be gay" and the gay man "deciding to be straight" i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes, after that i got really offended. as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles. the leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled. all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not. unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos.

when, oh when, will hollyweird write a decent movie based around computers? i cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story.no computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface. it may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts.as for "tracing" people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way. network security alone would prevent that from happening. the key stroke logging was laughable to say the least.regarding the software that was supposedly being installed, no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested, retested and tested again on a sandbagged system.but probably the worst possible part of the movie was the "virus". there is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system. and as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds, that just beggars belief. there is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow deletion of system files.i could go on but i can't be bothered.a porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage.

[ as a new resolution for this year 2005, i decide to write a comment for each movie i saw in theater (10%) or in dvd (90%). i must admit that dvd have revolutionized this habit. for instance, i can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential trait of the personality. in my country, non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations: french voice is terrible, very far away of its original tone ! the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices !!!! and well, if everybody found my comments unuseful, well, in 2006, i will stop my reviews... ah,ah.... so, enjoy them now !!!! ]my summary means that the story, locations, cast is not very enjoyable...only....sandra bullock is there.. she is a talented actress, able to get the viewer to catch on the movie....it reminds of a feminine "the fugitive".... so if you look for a moment of escaping your life, watching this movie makes it worse because sandra's life is a mess....she got nothing left to hold on to, only her poor mother (who is alzheimer ill: again the touch for depression)....in fact, she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie, has a sadder life throughout it, to finally get back to it at the end.... what a happy ending !!!!maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd's life....very far away from the best computer movie of all time: *wargames*

we can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world.those who understand binary and those who do not. those who understand binary put this movie to its grave along with hackers, while those who do enjoy this movie for the sake that none of this crap could happen. ever. for a movie to attempt to be a modern movie with fiction applied to it. it has failed. horribly. only a 11yr old and below can enjoy and only 30yr and up could be scared to have their identity taken. it losses out on the main market for a resale value(i watch it now it is more boring than when it was first released).

computing . can there be anything more boring ? sitting in front of a computer all day typing away at some keys all day every day , tap tap tapping . that's much of the problem with this movie , the heroine sits in front of a computer vdu tapping the keys and no matter how many looks of agitation she gives , or how much suspenseful notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close ups the director uses there's not much excitement down to the fact that there's few things less exciting than watching somebody on a computer there's a few other problems too much of them factual errors regarding how computers work . is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet ? i guess that when the net was made 10 years ago very few people would understand how computers worked so the screenwriters would have been able to bs at length but since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer the audience are certainly very clued up on the factual errors of this movie . and of course there's too many instances where someone acts stupid or out of character at crucial times in order to progress the plot which makes the net a very mediocre movie

rating: *1/2 out of ****"the net" is one of those films that won't remain in your mind till the next one hour. well... just if you keep thinking how bad it is. it's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage. one of those adjectives i've just used above is the reason which made me add 1/2 a star to the one i would have given. so is it a case of 'so bad it is good'? no. it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'. bullock in a (surprise!) very bad performance plays angela bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. she works at home, doesn't have any friends and her neighbors don't know her. suddenly, she sees herself involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her. her identity, bank accounts, etc, etc, etc, are all deleted, and she is now ruth marx. the conspiracy involves even the government and... wait! haven't we seen this before? yes, thousands of times. "the net" tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the '90s, showing the computer as a villain. big deal! it is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. take the scene of the boat accident. i just laughed when the camera started to get slow...what makes everything even worse here is sandra bullock. how awful she is! has she already made a decent film? "a time to kill", okay. but she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.the vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in "2001: a space odyssey", the best, most intelligent and most complex film ever made. it's not needed to compare "the net" with it, is it...?the only reason to see "the net" is to laugh, as i've said, and to see what it tried to be. the results, well, are a shame.delete this film from your mind!

when you make a film with a killer-kids premise, there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible, creating believable characters and situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something which the makers of "silent night, deadly night" did, for example, on an equally controversial subject: a killer santa). the people who made "bloody birthday", however, do neither of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun (or a knife, or a noose, or an arrow) in his/her hand. the result is both offensive and stupid. the whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years). it's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids, but it's very sloppily made. (*1/2)

after reading fool for love in a drama class of mine, i was looking forward to seeing how sam shepard's wonderful play would be translated to the screen. much to my dismay, it was nowhere near as entertaining as the play. the film seemed to drag, the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie, and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked out of this film version. it's a shame to see this come out this way even with shepard's involvement, playing the role of eddie. do yourselves a favor...see the play next time it's being performed in your area or simply read the book instead.

a very un-tom and jerry short. jerry narrates this tale that revolves around tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival, butch. tom is best friends with jerry here which irked me a bit. the cartoon is also presented in cinemascope. overall i found this tom and jerry cartoon sad and depressing. the should have just put "puss gets the boot" on the dvd instead and i would've been happy. this experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of warner brother's 2-dvd spotlight collection set. it's the last one on the set and i'm hoping that warner brothers chooses to release a second volume soon.my grade: c-

summary: not worth the filmas an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

this movie was nothing like the book. i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down. this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway. the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action. none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book. for a gone with the wind fan (of both the book and the movie) this was deeply disappointing. if you loved the book scarlett, don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen. they only share the title in common.

margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess! fine costuming and sets can't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley (as the title character) and the ever-bland timothy dalton (as rhett). even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script, which is astoundingly cliched and predictable. add to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing, and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer. scarlett is just amazingly lousy, and i can't imagine how it ever got made, much less made it to video.

alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's. margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels. i was a huge fan of margaret mitchells book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money.although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton, this is a really terrible film. the script is horrible and full of clichés. ann margarets cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her.the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy, feral villain - lord fenton. sean bean's performance is along the lines of "the man you love to hate" and portrays an unsafe sex symbol.but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script.don't waste your money on this film, unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance.

when people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said little. these children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film). lets start with the blonde - debbie - she's a slut of a girl, i mean come on she wears mini skirts, she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face. she acts so innocent. next we have the second child - the geek - who thinks he's so cool, with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile. the next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him. this film angered me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them.

'bloody birthday' is an odd and, at times, humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'the good son'.set in a small californian town, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions. ten years later, our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree, doing away with parents, siblings, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go!for a slasher film, it's very tame in terms of violence and gore, which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to. instead, it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. the main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth.'bloody birthday' is rather mediocre as a horror flick, with few scares and little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers, it is a bit unique in that way. one to watch if there's nothing else on.

is it a poorly acted, cliche-ridden pile of trash? of course. anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place. thus, i will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10:violence and gore: 4 -- for this genre, there are very few deaths, and the gore is almost non-existent. anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. the only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things, which raises the bar a little.suspense: 1 -- okay, i feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids.nudity/sex: 7 -- lots of boobage from three different women, one of whom is the mtv vj julie brown. there are two sex scenes, but little is shown in them.unintentional humor -- 4 -- there are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary, but all in all, it's just bad, not funny bad.overall -- 4 -- it's not unwatchable. there are a few fun moments, and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie. however, only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks. this definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it's not all the way at the bottom. the real downside is the disappointing ending. it almost ruined the movie for me.

formulaic slasher film, only this one stars three ten year olds (all born during a lunar eclipse) as the killers. nice, huh? a little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre, others beware.*1/2 out of ****

sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror. if you can just toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself... this (unfortunately) was not the case with "satan's whip".written and directed by jason maran, "satan's whip" attempts to drag us along on a boring snore-fest of a film, with no real pay off at the end. i'm guessing that the black & white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue, and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on. the story in itself is not that bad, and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic. this, combined with the slow-pacing and lack of any real (red) gore made "satan's whip" one to forget quite quickly. i will give it a "4" rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle, but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time.

this is a little slow-moving for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only effort on imdb. the camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good, and the acting  although variable  is better than is often found in indie genre flicks.as the lead, robert field is rather stiff, which is especially unfortunate given that his character, claude, is the film's narrator as well as the centre of its action. however, it was the entry of christopher (brandon despain) that i considered the turning point of this film  and not in a good way. a twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion, and slow-moving becomes drawn out and overly wordy.on the up side, pete barker is consistently entertaining as father william. he's the easy stand-out in what is a fairly ordinary offering. while the first half hour caught my interest, i ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out.

this is one of those star-filled over-the-top comedies that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead. unfortunately, one night at mccool's is a classic "b."goldie hawn recently commented about "town and country" that it's a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed. you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script, they also mangled it daily. maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say, "it's the script, stupid." this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through. they're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical, but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre.is it an unmitigated disaster? not entirely. there are some smiles along the way, mostly due to the efforts of the actors. i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking, "eh. it was okay." so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review? the ending. if, as it's been noted, the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending, then it misses spectacularly. i really wish i could speak specifically about it, but i hate people who give too much away (even in warning). suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent-over paul reiser (nothing given away here. it's in the trailer), get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking, "eh. it was okay." the rest of the movie is tacked-on and creatively bankrupt. and you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. if you loved "there's something about mary" or "meet the parents" (both great movies), then don't bother to see this movie. go have those teeth taken care of instead.

i'm afraid i only stayed to watch the first hour of this movie as it really seemed to me to be mindless tv-trash and a waste of talent. liv tyler plays a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the part any real kick. as she slowly seduces a bartender into a life of crime it is difficult to feel any real concern over any of the characters. even john goodman delivers his weakly comic lines with an absence of panache, as if the witless humour needs to be recited slowly in case anyone misses the joke. the ending is supposed to be good, but the starter and main course left me with no appetite to find out.

horrendous "comedy" in which a beautiful, crazy woman (liv tyler) "comedically" destroys the lives of three men (matt dillon, paul reiser and john goodman). dillon hires a hit man (michael douglas) to kill her. what is happening to comedy? the year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever (saving silverman, sugar and spice, freddy got fingered, tomcats, etc etc). this is one of the worst. there's not one, repeat, not one funny moment in it. the jokes are either stupid, unfunny, smutty or real sick. also there's a strong hatred of women in this garbage--the only main female character (tyler) is constantly used as a sex object. also extreme, bloody violence is thrown in at the end. the only bearable moments come from reba mcentire as a psychiatrist and andrew dice clay in two roles--both psychos. dillon, goodman and reiser have hit an all-time career low with this--the only way to go is up. and poor tyler! she quit doing intelligent, gutsy independent films for this? and douglas???? what was he on when he agreed to this? an utter piece of crap--to be avoided at all costs!!!!!!!!!!

one night at mccool's wants you to think it is a hip and clever black comedy. it pushes its "quirky" characters and "outrageous" situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime. the premise is about a gold digging woman, named jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder, so she can have all the worldly possesions she so desperately desires. you know, this wouldn't be a bad strategy, if she chased after rich guys. this film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and andrew "dice" clay. please. that major flaw in jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker (and that's unintentional). watching it, it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere. one night at mccool's just could not decide what direction it wanted to take, so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. it tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera, and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian. there is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the protaganist (played by matt dillon) about how the sex is with jewel. it seems like matt doesn't know, neither do the viewers. why was he dating her anyway? one night at mccool's also wants to be funny. sorry, bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didn't even work on three's company. what's worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. kind of like a sophomoric coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety, nor could its lackluster dirction sledgehammer in any shocks. what the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way.

i give this piece of hollywood trash 1 out 10! seriously! i mean, i like comedy as much as the next guy. i also can take just plain stupid comedy and actually sit back and laugh with it. but this film had nothing to laugh at or with.i like nearly all of the actors in this film. so i thought i'd overlook what many people told me about it (my fault for not listening). i was just mortified at how stupid this script was! just ridiculous and not even in a funny way. the only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when seeing other movies or on tv. i was very disappointed and i really would like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then still sign up to be in it! bad decision on their parts...*********************major spoiler************************okay - here's my biggest question on this film.......if the characters are looking back on this story of jewel (liv tyler) after the fact....then how can paul reiser have gone to a therapist remembering the past!?!?!?!? he dies in the last scene by being crushed by the dumpster!!!! can anyone answer me that?!?!?!?!? major goof on the part of the film makers.....nobody noticed this?!?!?!?!?!?!

i don't usually watch hollywood dribble, but i was dragged along with some friends to see this one, which turned out to be amusing in places but totally devoid of any originality. don't worry, you won't have to think - tarantino-like storyline leaves enough over-obvious hints for us to correctly predict where this one's going about fifteen minutes before every "twist" - i sat there worrying that the film was building up fairly nicely for a hollywood flick but that it would have nowhere to go at the climax. and boy were my fears realised - ymca couldn't save this one, but liv tyler almost did. i suppose being male and in my twenties helped, but she delivered a really good performance - obviously she didn't have to do much except look absolutely stunningly over-the-top sexy, but what she did she did well! mccool's is certainly not going to go down as one of hollywood's great successes (or should i say "shouldn't" because the mainstream american film industry is not going anywhere at present, and hasn't for a decade at least, save the odd hit like american beauty, titanic and saving private ryan, and even those had major flaws), but if you're a teen male, do yourself a favour and see liv - she is one hot chick. rating: 5/10. see also: anything by quentin tarantino, any american teen film over the last decade, anything with sex as its main selling point.

this show drives me crazy. it goes against everything a family should be, even if it is intended to be a comedy. the show is suppose to follow dave and vicky gold (michael rapaport and anita barone) as they raise their three teenage children: hilary, larry, and mike. a good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good show.i don't think i've ever heard cruder talk from parents to children and vice versa. the only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex. i know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it. the one episode i was just watching involved the parents giving their daughter, hilary a car, not once do you think they are related in anyway by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how hilary is like "their slave."the show fails on the comedy level the most. i haven't laughed at this show once in the numerous times i have attempted to watch it, and i'm a person who gave such films as animal house and dumb and dumber very high marks. michael rapaport is a very good actor and why he choose to ruin his career by making this piece of filth show is beyond me. parents, make sure your children never and i mean never watch this. teenagers, you'll probably get a laugh out of this just for the blatant sexual references but nothing comes out of it and afterwards you feel rather empty. 1 1/2/ 5 stars.

i grew up watching sitcoms such as seinfeld, roseanne, simpsons, etc. etc. in other words mainstream television. over the years many sitcoms have come on the air and of those a very small percentage are genuinally smart and funny. the war at home is a prime example of the majority of modern american comedy.i give the show a 3 out of 10 because it is what it aims to be, a comedy, but it doesn't seem to go out of its way to be a good comedy. a good comedy should have you swept off your feet with its big jokes, you shouldn't be able to see them coming and in twah i see just about every joke coming. the characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes i have seen yet on screen, and the acting isn't very good save for the father who portrays a stereotypical beer drinking sport loving american idiot perfectly.poor acting, unbelievable characters, and jokes that don't catch you off guard detract from this show to a point of where it is unwatchable. if you don't have cable and would like to see a comedy worth watching, try boston legal. it is more worth your time.

what was he thinking?!?!?! how sad an actor as tremendously talented as michael rapaport- who stole our hearts in "mighty aphrodite" and fascinated us in "ill town"- has sunk to this pathetic level. the writing on this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped. shame on all involved. there is a trend: major movie actors that are no longer hot merchandise are turning to tv- often with disastrous results (reference the stinkaroos on cbs and nbc; however, abc has a hit with "boston legal"- hip writing and great nostalgic use of bill shatner). to waste michael rapaport in this "all in the family" rip-off is an insult to viewers and mostly michael himself.

a stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh track that must be from i love lucy. i got rid of tv because of shows like this, but picked up the 1st season at big lots for $3.00. should bought the van damme movie instead.if i was a conspiracy theorist, who believed that a small group of people are working against real families and keep coming up with this drivel/propaganda in order to undermine family values i would point to this show, married with children, family guy etc. but i'm not so i won't.btw i'm not christian, love the simpsons and peep show. i watched two episodes and thought that if shows like this are popular, who are they popular with? then i remembered all those fotos of the people of walmart that have been circulating around the web and thought ah ha!. it is no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is prime time.

i'm one of those gluttons for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days-i still will check them out every once in a while.my observation is that most of them aren't very funny even the ones on major networks that are getting high ratings ,i just don't get who is finding them gut busting funny. while a few have made me crack a smile ,none of them made me laugh out loud,i usually change the channel after a few minutes. now on the fox network they churn out new shows like changing your underwear,for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom,wrong dead wrong. they have beat this dead horse so much it is to the point of hiring just anyone they can find to write a crappy pilot with bad dialog and just churn them out.let's take a brief look at the latest piece of junk that fox has churned out called "the war at home"i watched about 5 minutes of it and that was generous. in this particular episode,the daughter is mouthing off to her parents doing the i'm an adult now rant.the dad gets fed up tells her "ok fine,go ahead and do whatever you want,if you screw up it's your problem" to which she replies"well i guess your mad but hey at least i didn't get aids"(cue the laugh track,no way that can be a live audience unless they have been paid to applaud such garbage)-i found the crack about not having aids to be in such bad taste. well hey at least i don't have to watch any more of this crap. take a hint fox, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.ok well you have the simpsons but it is now getting really old and tired as well.

what fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, made up of mean, obnoxious, spoiled kids, and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to being a parent?? i'm sorry, i don't get it. the one episode that i was barely able to stomach watching involved one of the kids demanding a bar mitzvah, with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money. of course, the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior has to have the biggest and bes-test party of all, and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event. the ditzy, brain dead, boy crazy teenage daughter bounces back and forth between wanting to be jewish and then catholic, when she see's the "cute" religious tutors.the one borderline "heartwarming" moment in the entire episode, was when the putz of a father, who has been convinced the entire time that the bar mitzvah is solely a money making scheme, see's the son studying his hebrew lessons, and is momentarily duped into thinking that perhaps, his conniving offspring is being sincere about the right of passage into manhood. this warm, fuzzy feeling is immediately ripped out of his chest when he informs junior that since he has not yet had a bris, a certain "procedure" needs to be performed. the bar mitzvah is called off, and the mother is out several thousands of dollars when the kid refuses to comply.this show is garbage, and i am saddened that i shall never get back the 23 minutes of my life i wasted watching this piece of crap, because nothing else was on tv ...

i watched the first episode of "the war at home" because i thought it was worth replacing "arrested development", boy, was i disappointed. it should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped-off of "grounded for life", "titus", and "married...with children" since they are all similar in plot and overall mood. the so called "punch lines" are all repetitious and formulaic, even more, those "punch lines" aren't even funny at all, to me, they're more along the lines as being crass and crude. the main character dave gold acts like a white trash thug, who thinks he's being funny and cool, which he's not. (even hillary (dave's daughter) said so in the episode "gaza strip").in the episode "dream crusher", hillary wanted to be a singer {but was actually pretty bad}, dave and vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked. after that, she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to harvard, after telling dave and vicky so and left the room, the two of them began mindlessly mocking her. also, in the first episode dave said of hillary's {black} boyfriend "does she actually think we're gonna let her go out with this guy? i'd rather drink my own urine", that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television. and dave is constantly making fun of larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a geek. also, let's not forget that he also made fun of larry's (fat) girlfriend. dave is the father he's supposed to stand up for his son no matter what. "the war at home" is without a doubt the worst tv show for family. that clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda. it's like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something, but the lines are all somewhat forced, idiotic and pathetically juvenile.another reason why the show's horrible is the acting, mike rappaport and kyle sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. rappaport has to always move his hands around when he's in front of the camera, he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with "boston public". sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts (he also did this in "malcolm in the middle"}.so to wrap this whole thing up, you all got your reasons of what's wrong with this show 1.it's unoriginal 2.the acting sucks 3.it's not even funny 4.all the jokes are the same 5.has lousy script 6.the characters are pitiful and unlikable 7.the dad's a rip-off of archie bunkerfox needs to take this trash off the air, because anything's better than this.

there are shows and films i've seen and subsequently read reviews of on imdb.com that i've disagreed with, and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion.reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving tv network employees being ordered to browse the internet, posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programmes they themselves are responsible for.how else would one explain a review opining that this show is "sure to become a phenomenon" a full year after it's become clear its going to be nothing of the sort?i won't waste words describing this mess, but suffice to say if you enjoy, wives who emasculate their husbands, husbands who emasculate their sons, children who are disrespectful jackasses towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to legitimise characters that are basically just unfunny one-liner spewing automatons, then watch this show.i, on the other hand, have some seinfeld dvds to get through.futurama - cancelled. titus - cancelled. arrested development - cancelled. the war at home - renewed.no justice.

i have been living in istanbul for 24 years and i (a 39 years of experience would suggest) do know what istanbul has gone through all those years.faith akin is still quite young (born in 1973) and falling in the great mistake of being orientalist when looking at turkey (just as his other movie gegen die wand did) this movie seriously lack contemporary urban turkish life and misleads the audience when giving out (quite false) clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of istanbul.anyone who could speak turkish could easily attest that many underground bands & groups depicted in the movie (siyasiyabend for one ) are so miserable and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as 'representatives' of the contemporary turkish music. much less a piece of crap which many turkish listeners even do not know about at all.we turks have long been accustomed to 'superficious' westerners who look at turkey with some orientalist point of view: trying to fit the actual turkish image into their mind molds.. what is new in this movie is the fact that now a turkish originated director (faith akin) is making the same mistake: looking at turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better. all of a vain effort.just ask any turkish friend of yours: what sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names : zeki muren, baris manco, ajda pekkan, teoman, muslum gurses, ibrahim tatlises, ferdi ozbegen?.. and many others who have shaped so far the real music we are listening today?faith akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people's minds with false images about the contemporary turkish music.

what can be said about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks? the hero starts out in ninjaville, japan, goes through an identity crisis (saving a shinobi), makes a voyage to america (saving a slave named sam) engages in a little wild west action (saving a french/japanese native american named julie), goes hunting pirate's gold, and then heads back to japan to fight a war. the film obviously has no clue where it's going at any point in time; i think the director modeled each scene after the last movie he'd watched. if you're going to watch this film, i suggest renting the subtitled so you and your peers can openly discuss how dumb the movie is without speaking over the movie, potentially missing another dumb plot twist.movies the director was watching during the making of this movie - an american tail, fievel goes west, star wars, indiana jones, the goonies, teenage mutant ninja turtles, kung fu, vampire hunter d, the ten commandments.notes of interests - most fear inspiring line of all time. about 90 minutes (or 19 days) into the movie, the lead character has just bested an american villain, and just as one heads to the vcr to end the pain the hero proclaims "let's go back to japan", and the agony continues for another week.

above all, you must not take this movie seriously. it takes itself seriously, unfortunately, but that can't be helped. this anime ninja flic has to be the crowning achievement in spoiling what could have been an endearing, if unoriginal, story with bad plot twists, ridiculous time-killing cutscenes, and one outrageous guest appearance which will either make you laugh or groan (or both, like me).while i'm typically a fan of ninja/samurai anime (ninja scroll and rurouni kenshin to name a few), this one has to be the exception. for the record, from a technical point of view of its time, this movie was very well animated and constructed. it is just the plot that stunk. the authors of this movie clearly decided (for what rational reason i don't know) that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character halfway around the world in search of a treasure that (he learns) his father fought and died for. in the process, he saves a black slave named sam, meets a french girl who is living in an apache village, makes friends with a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him, meets more family members then he knew he had in the weirdest places and circumstances (and whom all subsequently die at some point in the movie).even so far, these ludicrous plot twists could be excused, but then come the two "guest appearances". #1: after having a ridicuously cliche showdown with two cowboys, jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "mark twain". at this point, you're probably saying "what the ****?!!" this "meeting" serves one purpose: it entirely discredits a movie which tries to add to itself an educated historical background. i found it disappointing that the authors went to all this trouble to research the 1860s us and didn't manage to realize that "mark twain's" real name was samuel clemens. #2: when jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it used to belong to captain kidd. i can hear the groans of disgust now.finally, there are the running scenes. these scenes show various characters running, with the landscape moving statically behind them, for several minutes, and there are a lot of them. it is these scenes which make this movie, 2hrs 12 min, to seem to last a week and a half.if you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitled movie that just asks to be made fun of, this is it. feel free to poke fun at every possible aspect of it, and have fun. just don't take it seriously. 3/10

i have no idea who these others are but this movie is plain awful. they have to prop up joe pesci when he is a minor character. bait and switch movie just like the studios did with adam sandler and jim carrey, etc. the dvd i watched states "this obscure gem revolves around joe pesci's mob character who is a hothead that start a war" etc. etc. joe plays the part of joe, he does not even carry a gun, plays a whimpy character and gets spoiler - (whacked). so much for the movie revolving around pesci. the only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy when they passed gas while waiting for a score. if you watch this movie after reading this, i warned you. please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.

bad news for anyone wanting to film a full-length parody of a lifetime network movie- the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it, albeit unintentionally. all of the lifetime tropes are there- a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married), and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints, forcing her to stand up for herself. especially jaw-dropping is the scene where the heroine, after enduring a break-in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to relieve the stress by going shopping! having seen first hand the harassment of a co-worker by some creep she met at church, i know stalking is not a joke, but it certainly is in this movie.

warning: this may contain spoilers!!first of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just that....lifetime movies. some are great (really), some are good and some are bad. unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category. it actually started out with some potential....single, divorced hard working mom (who gets out of work at 2:00 am) cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let's just say he doesn't take it too well. the stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and escalates to her home being broken into and completely trashed. so she goes to her mother's for the night and the next morning her mother's car blows up. this seems to be just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping!!! so the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does mom do? she goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a pizza!!! i couldn't believe it! then it really gets stupid! and the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. too bad because it seemed to have possibilities.

think you've seen the worst movie in the world? think again. the person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising. the cover makes it look like a good, scary horror suspense thriller. but, no. what we have instead is nightscream. a movie that makes a "sweeeoooowww!!" noise every time a credit flashes across the screen. the biggest name in the entire film is probably casper van dien who hardly has a part.i voted a one for this one only because i couldn't vote any lower. if i could vote something like negative five-thousand, trust me, i would have. so, for now, i'm going to give nightscream 1/2* out of 5 just because it ended.

this is horrible even for a tv movie. i can't believe it took three people to write this movie. i am not familiar with the novel on which this film was based, but it has got to be better than this. i'd rather watch a "full house" marathon than this stupid movie. i gave it 2 out of 10 stars only because it was made better by commercials.

nightscream is a tv movie so it's bound to be pretty dire especially as it's a supposed horror film. this young girl is haunted by dreams as she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman one year before. she is amazed when everyone in the town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl. the townsfolk are amazed when she keeps entering dream like trances where she reveals accurate details about the murder and murderer because the police got it all wrong apparently. thinking that they are in danger of being found out, the murderers (there are two of them) start to hatch a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth. by this time you will have probably fallen asleep and why do the makers of the film have the 'mist-making' machine on full throttle in the dream sequences.

while watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard tv movie... though through out the picture the plot changes (if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot) are by the book and unoriginal... and with every one the movie kept getting worse!candace cameron bure, famous for her role as dj tanner on the hit tv show full house, is not very convincing as a possessed twenty something.. trying to avenge the possesers death. i believe she is fine actress.... just not in the thriller range.the filming was trashy, and like i said the plot stale... though watching it i knew i was in for automatic cheese, i had no idea how much worse this film could get...i highly do not recommend this movie... unless cheep filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for

i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this. this, my friends, is one of the worst tv movies i've ever seen. there is no excitement in this film.the story starts out with drew summers(candice cameron bure) driving to a small town while in a trance. she stays with a couple who coincidentally, had a daughter named laura fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike. thing is, laura was killed over a year ago. her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered, making it look like he had killed her.while settling in this town for a while, drew starts to have visions and nightmares. these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isn't the killer after all. throughout the film, you find out that ray ordwell sr.(denis arndt) is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her.the movie is too long and very boring. the film just drags on and on and on and on. amazingly, i saw another tv movie after this called (cloned) 1997 which was good but i'll review that one later.i give this movie 1 star out of 10. avoid this tv movie. it is not worth your time. this is the worst tv movie of 1997!

matthew aldrich. this is a name worthy of remembrance. this is the individual that took fingers to keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time. cliché. predictable. an insult to the public's intelligence.is he the sole beneficiary of blame? of course not. renny harlin took this abysmal excuse for a script and made it into a movie. sam jackson and ed harris actually read it (or not) and chose to star in it. culpability abounds.this is the denise richards of film scripts. there aren't enough razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is.in all fairness, samuel jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the manner in which it's presented is highly creative, but, at the end of the day, it's all just trimmings. pretty trimmings.package it any way you want- garbage writing is still garbage writing.

tom cutler (jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleaner-upper. in his latest job, he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isn't aware the crime hasn't been officially reported. uh oh, this can't be good. you hear about cleaners all the time, but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up. this one is different in that tom cutler works with the police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene. hey, someone has to do it. you know the police won't. the movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up. this is almost a good thriller, but a side plot involving tom's daughter (palmer) makes this story somewhat awkward. i guess they had to fill in some time. oh, they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot, but it was still a reach and awkward. see?this was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension, suspense and the pace was somewhat draggy. the music didn't help either as i noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey. you know, journey music. get it? ha!the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller. violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: no

i normally don't try and second guess a crime thriller, but cleaner was just entirely too predictable. samuel l. jackson playing the character tom cutler, along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film, however, that was about it. without even thinking i knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes i had already figured out who the killer was. rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a turnabout, i watched to its completion. what a disappointment, i was right from the beginning.the casting of characters was a good, as well as the acting from jackson and harris...except for eva mendes. from the starting gate she didn't play a believable character in correlation to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon. maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the story itself. her role as ann norcut should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her. this would've made the build-up a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic. nevertheless, cleaner is watchable, not memorable. i've seen episodes of csi that were more thrilling then this.

request you to not watch this movie... it starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end... predictable,not entertaining at all,wasted movie... save your time and watch better thrillers.... the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie... but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start... no great suspense.. no great direction... nothing phenomenal with the acting... shy away from this... low rating... nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie is...really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it...

it starts really interesting - the story develops around the main character, who runs a "cleaning business", specialized in cleaning up crime scenes. as a former cop, he runs into some strange situation, when one job does suddenly "offically vanish". furthermore, he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption. his "columbo feeling" is justified, the deeper he gets into the background of the story. the good actors (jackson, ed harris, eva mendes) play in an suspenseful story with some twists --- but only up to the last 25 minutes. (up to here 7 of 10 stars). spoiler:::: suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot-out, involving the 14-year old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development... why not having cutler giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship? or having the daughter discovering some facts? or ... many possible much better story finishes are imaginable... a truly wasted ending!

not even original in the plot. ho hum. there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of hollywood movies. i don't really "get" samuel jackson's acting most of the time in his other films, but he was rather good in this film. he rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an "in your face anger." i liked eva mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy, she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress. luis guzman was actually really good also, except that i disliked the change of his character towards samuel jackson at the end of the film. how can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second? is there no original thought left in hollywood?

a plot that is dumb beyond belief. however, that said, it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare. and that is as it should be. it isn't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma.hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna kerns. she proves that just because it isn't on the page doesn't mean a role can't be seized and dug into. and she does so with gusto. good for her.ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy, but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script.and to grant show as well. a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps (ryan's hope, melrose place). he is always versatile and underrated. his primary drawback seems to be his impossible-to-ignore good looks. he is a sturdy, well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do.the rest of the cast is basically window dressing.the direction is adequate and the script, as i alluded to, is fairly idiotic.watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing. it's fun.

i had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well i wondered if i had read the wrong reviews. please, a boy meets girl next door at 11 and both aspire to love and being basketball legends. grow apart, but watch each others progress. guess what! both get scholarships to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman. our young hero unable to cope has lapse in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies, and guess what is picked up by lakers. dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period. so for 5 years they go their own way. she returns from spain having lost the zest for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she professes her on-going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. he wins he marries she wins he loves her. well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl. the end has her playing basketball and he has baby duties. sorry 2 is my high score. my partner she scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read mills and boon

one of the most boring movies i've ever had to sit through, it's completely formulaic. just a cookie cutout of a movie, you could predict about every scene in the movie just from knowing the genre, as this movie adds nothing new. the dialogue is never funny, interesting, or intelligent. the acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything looks to have been done by an amatuer filmmaker. nothing fresh, memorable, or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is long gives it an easy thumbs down. sorry, fans.overall grade: f

the acting in this film was of the old school: corny and stiff. irene dunne is luminous, and comes off the best even though she has some very unnatural lines to say. still, her ability to convey emotion comes through.old movie buffs will find at least some redeeming qualities in this film through observation of cinematic technique of the 1930s. otherwise, it is not really that worthwhile.

the ealing comedies constitute their own specific sub-genre in the history of film. they were wry, droll reflections on british life in the late forties and early fifties. they are always amusing but i feel it is misleading to characterise them as comedies. they are breezy and good-humoured, rather than laugh-out-loud funny. however, the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak (epecially kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers).i have an affection for all of them, but the lavender hill mob is probably the one i have most difficulty with. compared to the others, it seems somewhat perfunctory. to me, it is an outline sketch for a movie, but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras.everything about it is a bit undercooked. for example, nobody is given any real context or background. henry is simply a dutiful drudge, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go unrecognised, while albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living. this establishes a motive for their crime, but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan.other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story. the elderly resident in henry's guest house could (with her love of detective stories) have been made an unwitting thorn in his side, but is merely used as background 'colour'. similarly, the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot ticking along.as a result, the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices, which i find both frustrating and faintly irritating. the not-very-ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems, despite albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan (by sidney tafler's clayton). the gold is then smuggled to france without mishap. everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn't for a minor hitch, lamely based on the french pronunciation of the letter 'r', which results in six of the gold eiffel towers being accidentally sold to some english schoolgirls.this leads to a series of frantic chases as henry and albert seek to retrieve them. these scenes are well executed, but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the schoolgirls by a series of wholly factitious accidents. it is as if god is deliberately intervening to give them a hard time. this kind of plotting always has me grinding my teeth.when they finally track the last eiffel tower to a police academy exhibition and snatch it from under the nose of john gregson's police inspector (why is he there, anyway?) all shreds of plot logic are abandoned. the final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began.the movie doesn't even bother to tell us the fate of albert (stanley holloway), lackery (sid james) and shorty (alfie bass).this genial little caper has the professionalism of the ealing team behind it, so it is far from being a bad movie. i suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than i do (and why shouldn't they?), but i cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made, if only more time and effort had been expended on fleshing out both the characters and the story.by the standards established by ealing, lavender hill mob is a missed opportunity.ps: one curious footnote is that audrey hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on, but archie duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution. i guess she just had a better agent.

i watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and i won't make that mistake again.the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy, but you don't see what it is. flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. when the ending is finally reveled, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn't happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. the only connection these people have is that they have all had a "bad day"--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom.if this was supposed to be a "crash" clone, it's a complete failure.

a nicely evoked 1930s setting provides much interest for a viewer in the early 21st century; unfortunately, "london belongs to me" has little else to recommend it besides lashings of quaint english charm. all of the problems rest with the deeply unfocused story. the main plot concerns the actions of young lad richard attenborough, the problems he gets into and how the community in which he lives bands together to save him from society's laws. or something. the main issue here is that attenborough's character brings everything upon himself and, quite frankly, is guilty of almost every accusation brought against him, so it's baffling why the film (and all the characters) have so much sympathy for him. he's treated as a victim of circumstance when he really, really isn't; and what's more he isn't shown to have very much remorse for his actions, only caring about getting away with things he didn't mean to do. alastair sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot line and you wonder what he's doing there (though sim is, as always, superb). you know there's a problem with the structure when the main plot impacts constantly against the subplot but not vice-versa. and, following a sedate pace and a careful build up, the plot completely falls apart in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfying and unexplained conclusion which doesn't even show us if attenborough's character has developed at all from the previous proceedings. the film doesn't end, it just stops.the acting, direction and the general feel of the film can all be commended but unfortunately the story and structure of the piece jars constantly. a last point of trivia: alec guinness based his performance in the vastly superior film "the ladykillers" on alastair sim's performance in this film, right down to both the characters having almost identical first scenes.

this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through. 30 minutes into the film and i couldn't take any more. seriously, do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo-arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured. boring, although the acting is fine; the kid is just plain irritating. some scenes are a little strange with very weird close-ups. i don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white, but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably. there was just nothing to watch, and although its a sad tale, supposedly, its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters.

i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a shill.the acting of the female lead is actually quite good, but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it. this is the very definition of dullness.so far, this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes. that must mean the director, director's girlfriend, producer, actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10.for the rest of you, who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story, avoid this.this man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10.fda note: while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep, no medicinal value is implied or offered.

this film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband through suicide. she is tormented by her son who refused to speak after that.child grief is rarely explored on film, so it is refreshing to see a film like addison's wall. however, due to the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. apart from a few key emotional moments, everything in the film is very plain. the abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable. addison's wall could have been much better, such as exploration of the contents of the wall, a more intensive care program to help addison to go through his trauma. instead, the film feels very unfinished and non engaging.

this movie tries to say something profound; i'm just not sure what it was. too much is left unresolved in the end for me to figure out the main point. a couple scenes really have me wondering what was left on the cutting room floor. i don't think the wall was very well developed i never got what was actually going on there. when the mother finally unveils it i just couldn't make any connection to the boy's silence. what was the point of the boy not talking? was he just delusional or did he acquire some sort of power. what was the scene with the burnt girl all about? another power the boy has or what? i don't understand how that developed any character or moved the plot. i got the bully bit but what happened to the dog? did the dog come back or did mom get rid of fido for good somehow? there were several additional plot elements that were more clutter than use. like the radio talk show in the background discussing the iraq war. i think that was supposed to create some sort of comparison to the grief and insecurity the mother and addison were experiencing but for me it was distracting and strained. i didn't buy the link very much. i also found the teacher getting on addison about not saying "here" for roll call a bit much. the mom seeing the doctor was pointless, how did it serve the plot? was that to show how desperate the mother was getting, or was it something about the medicine that i didn't get? was that the dad coming back in the last scene, or just some guy? so did writing on the wall work? what happened to the dog?

conclusion: very, but very, very boring, yet i watched till the end, hoping for some upside-down effect, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. the old black&white game didn't helped at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but this was not the case. the script, the plot, etc were linear, had no substance, nothing in-going. when you deal with psychological, you deal with analysis, therefore with details, that unity-diversity formula....there was no essence, no detail. just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of movie-makers...well, this is not the one.

a depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use shades or drapes in her windows. he steels assorted things from her, peeps at her, does prank calls, and plays assorted unpleasant tricks on her. oddly, he keeps none of this a secret from her. at first, she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her. then later she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel fevered activities.there are some illogical items to note. one is that the guy peeps into the night through a pane of glass from the more brightly lit side. in real life such a thing would not happen. the more brightly lit side of a pane of glass acts as a mirror. he would be able to see exactly nothing. also, everyone out in the night would be able to look inside at him sitting in his well lit room.one other illogical item is that the creepy teen takes a job as a milkman, and his one and only customer each morning seems to be the lady he is picking on. easy work, if you can get it.i saw a short film about love at a public showing. by the end, there was not a single open eye in the house. a short film about love is the foreign language movie for those who do not like reading subtitles. not only are there very few words spoken in the film, but much of the movie is silent. a certain rest in peace.

this is an excruciatingly boring, slow-moving movie. we can feel some sympathy for the socially- and sexually-inexperienced and awkward tomek, but the motivations of magda are pretty hard to see, and the ending, at least for me, was inscrutable. maybe it's about how we all need love, but i'd get more out of a good busby berkeley.i'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines, so i'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and institutions. i wonder if it's meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government.finally, watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in magda's stove.

surprisingly kieslowski's this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes cliché script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes. there is an isolated young boy. he lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building. it seems! that he wants her. he is one of the youths who are not good at communication with the opposite sex. however, he likes that woman, when the woman comes to his house with a man, tomek gets pain. then, we understand that kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. he does not do something else, because may be he knows that it is his salvation. one day, he stops that woman, suddenly, he seems a shy boy, but proves that he is not, so he explains her almost everything. she lectures and refuses him. everything is so realistic like the other kieslowski films, no problem. the problems start when tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love) turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman, at the beginnings the woman refuses, but after a short time, she starts to change her mind. this u-turn makes the movie cliché firstly. the personality of tomek is weird? or a result of a poor observation? i disappointed with this character, this is my opinion and i will try to tell why. when he goes to her house, magda treats him very friendly. she asks what do you want from me? to kiss me? to make love with me? to go out with me? at this point, i remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. see? returning to the scene, tomek rejects all the proposals. why? because he is shy? i don't think so, but his communication is blunt, ok. after the leg scene at home, some events make the movie misses its aim. i think that the aim of the movie is (should have been according to the story) to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy owing to lack of communication and being aloof especially for men. i mean that at this point, what does the movie say? it is blurred and disappointing. it is seen that he is not hunger for love or a female or sex. then, what? and the suicide attempt scene support this weakness. so that he touches her legs, he wants to kill himself! by the way, as i mentioned before, some say magda is a femme fatale. totally not. she endeavors in order to make tomek happy. does she avoid having contact with him? no. does she insult him? no. does she amuse him? no. and does she deceive him? no. she has some troubles with her (ex) lover, so she is not o.k. however, she does not take revenge for it from tomek. she is not an angel, but not a femme fatale also.

would a different translation have made it chillier or scarier? are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language? does it even matter? you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting. well, this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. if this isn't about homosexuality, murder, dismemberment, psychopaths, insanity, deviant psychology, then it is about acting - acting helped along with lots of dialog, so, enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually is.for english speakers, "twelve angry men" might be a better choice. there's a bit more interaction, and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog. you don't have to wonder if you're missing something.i would recommend andy warhol's "empire" to those who like this film.

i think i would probably not hate this movie if i spoke polish. i selected the english version at the first menu, but it gave me polish dialogue with english subtitles, just as the polish version did. maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into english very well. to exacerbate the issue, some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all. the acting was pretty bad, especially the female lead, who was melodramatic about everything! one scene that bothered me was when a german woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds. i couldn't see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film. maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience. much of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by the americans. first, the "american" uniforms did not look anything like u.s. army uniforms. second, none of the extermination camps in poland were liberated by the americans. i would think that a polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an american born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the russians. all in all, it's just not a very good film if you don't speak polish.

the expert, starring jeff speakman, is the definition of dull!!!dull, characters, dull situations, dull direction, dull actors, dull cinematography, dull music.i don't really understand this movie. is it supposed to be an action movie? it's almost as if speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in the expert is below your average tv drama. and there are some typical "speakman pummeling bad guys" scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama, which is totally wrong for speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star. in the end, this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland. the worst aspect of the expert is the music. the composer is a jerry goldsmith wannabe, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply doesn't belong in this kind of (dull) movie. it's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score, which makes the entire movie look even more confused, goofier and dull.don't waste your time watching this, even if you're a jeff speakman fan.

oh, well i thought it should be a good action, but it was not. although jeff speakman stars there is nothing to watch.only two fight for almost 1,5 hours, yak.a lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it. the plot is clear from the beginning. if you want good action don't rent this movie.

jeff speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than don "the dragon" wilson, for example), and with vehicles like "the expert", you can see why. there are three major problems with this movie: 1) the plot - or should i say plots - are all over the place, there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose, 2) there are only 4 fight scenes in total, some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark, 3) the music score is overzealous and overbearing. strange as it may seem, this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic, instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching. with all that said, at least there's james brolin around to lend a touch of credibility. *1/2 out of 4.

amitabh and jiah khan, raised great expectations, by their press conferences, though it was quite easy for the critics, and the fans too, that after all, this much hyped, ram gopal verma factory product, is going to fall flat on it's face, in all the probabilities ! why, because jiah was so immature and childish, and bacchan, mixed up guilty, and unsure . they themselves didn't know, what the hell they were talking about, to the press, keeping up with the tag line, that some love stories are not to be understood, or some such rubbish ! why the title is nishabd ? ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of sanskrit, as vidhu vinod needs to study mahabharata, tagging in line, another glorious flop of the year, eklavya ! comparison with the sweet hearts, and lolit's is inevitable, as the so-called plot line is supposed to have inspired by them. but sadly, ramu has hardly made any serious effort, to delve deeply into the psyche of the aging, and the young ones. is lolly pop sucking the ultimate indicator of the innocence ? and contrary to that streak of childishness, the leg show at the dining table, with a vijay, that is bacchan in that role, bursting into squeals of shameless laughter incessantly after wards ? this girl, is in fact at her seductive game, luring poor vijay to think, she is in love with him. the legs,too are skinny enough, and that act of putting the water hose through the legs, is down right obscene. it's beyond any one's understanding, how can a girl , coming as a guest to some body's house, can be so brazen, brash, and over powering ? and why the hell that stupid wife, played by revathi, remarkably well, though scripted poorly, and characterized unrealistically, encourages her own husband, to dance with a sexily saying young girl ? that part of vijay, trying to gain some refreshers to his humdrum life is absolute bullshit. because, apparently it seems that he is happy as he is, with a well settled life, and a hobby to recreate. this reminds of blame it on rio, the older daddy, and his young love, superbly played by michael caine. bacchan looks terrible in close ups, and over all, where as kevin spacey and jeremy irons looked debonair and handsome, which is why the young chicks some times get attracted to older men, for their charming persona, compared to the vulnerability of young boys of their age. only good thing about this movie is those green , sprawling land scapes , winding roads, and pleasant cinematography. no substance, or even any sparkling show of emotions, drama , or even intriguing, stormy sex like in lolita, this shallow movie has no wonder, fallen flat on it's face, and had to be wound up from the screens during first weeks ! next time round, before mindlessly copying any such theme from hollywood, ramu should do his home work, and bacchan should think twice ! you can not fool all the people at all the times, mr. bacchan!

good attempt at tackling the unconventional topic of may-december romances. however, the treatment is totally unrealistic. sure, sixty-year old men can and do fall for younger women, but they're usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values and viewpoints ... not neurotic, immature near-underage girls. of course there are exceptions, and they come close to being called pedophiles! sorry rgv, but it's not credible that a sane and accomplished sexagenarian would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers ... all for an 18-yr old that doesn't have a practical thought in her head and that behaves like an unstable escapee from a mental institution. you don't have to have a phd in psychology to see that amitabh's character is seduced by sex, and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issues.as for the recurring scene of vijay perched on the edge of a cliff, contemplating suicide, that's about as close as he comes to having anything in common with jiah, by behaving like a smitten teenage boy.on a positive note: the actors did a good job, and cinematography good.

this movie did not give mr. bachchan justice. he is a great actor and i was very disappointed in the movie and there was not much plot to it. matter a fact this is the first movie i have ever been disappointed in with him in it. it starts out with her coming to his home with his daughter and he is a photographer. he takes pictures of her in the garden has she's hosing herself down. he is a sixty year old man that has nothing to do but to take pictures of this girl. the movie makes no sense. the whole movie is about her chasing him around and her telling him how much she cares about him. then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she is not bored and is daughter finds out. i just didn't think this movie was up to bachchan's standards. he is better than this movie. i always pictured him as an upstanding person and then i seen him in this movie and i couldn't picture him in this movie. the movie didn't hold my interest at all. i couldn't wait until the movie was over. and you won't either.

there is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. lolita did it. american beauty did it.but. they did it subtly. they did not make it so apparent from the start that the director is gearing them up to make them fall in love with each other. not as naturally as two people would (age no bar) but forcing them to be around each other as if they were supposed to fall in love.all in all, there should have been chemistry. it would have solved the biggest problem. people with reservations against the subject would also have been engrossed and perhaps convinced. it would have become the perfect love story, no matter the impracticality.i found it difficult to believe jia's character at times. what i found more difficult to understand, is why vijay - a photographer and an artist, who seems serious - would have had an interest in a girl so frivolous. unless he himself has some frivolousness hidden in himself, which did not come out at all.there is a lot of use of dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. it is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right. so rgv is himself calling the relationship unnatural.the camera angles, background score, editing, and even the juxtaposition of shots and symbology emphasises and overemphasises their relationship. is the indian audience so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand? especially when the two of them were dancing together... it was apparent what was happening. what was the need of slowing the scene down with dramatic background music? i feel the subject was very well chosen. but verma should not have made the film with the fact in mind constantly that this is a controversial subject. if it is, then handle it delicately, why don't you?

the worst thing i have ever watch.the movie is pure trash. all the things is bad on this movie. the direction, screenplay, arts, cinematography, cast or anything else.may i say more?the main character is an boy. it has to have 20 years of age approximately, but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old, in addition he is an very bad actor.the editing tries to save it, but with that very bad material in hands they can't do miracles.as i said, the cast is poor, the text is poor, that it doesn't help the actors.i learned how to "do not" make a movie.

i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all.in this case however i have to say it was bad. i am a scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second.there was no proper storyline. i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces.the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary. half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. a 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together.this movie was bad.dominic

it's a shame that such a lame plot should be hung on such picturesque locations, with some documentary style reportage shoved in for extra length. a shorter film may have held the tension a little more, and a more charismatic lead may not have mangled his lines so much. the female lead also, was not allowed to do enough resulting in a pretty but boring affair. it builds towards the end but the lead actor's own redemption is too little too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. not awful, just a pity. unexciting but nice enough to grace tv schedules of the early hours.

of all the adaptations of books by alistair maclean, i feel that this qualifies as the worst, but don´t blame maclean!. it would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title. we have no suspense, no sense of foreboding of mystery, no chance to really empathize with the main characters. we spend the entire duration (or at least i did) waiting for charlotte rampling to shed her clothing (for charlotte, this appears to take a remarkably long time!). still, a glimpse of charlotte rampling´s tits really can´t save this disastrous film. maclean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit-pickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books. poor old alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out. at least "bear island" - which also uses the maclean name but apparently none of his novel - was a little exciting. the excitement here is in waiting for the final credits.

proof, if ever proof were needed, that hammer should have left their vampires firmly in the victorian age. after all, vampirism is all about repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in 1972's london, with its thirty-something thesps pretending to be randy teenagers.remember, by this time, hammer was floundering badly. the public had tired of the drawing room horror of the 1950s and 60s, so the studio was trying everything to bring them back, including ample nudity (lust for a vampire, et al) and updating their characters - neither of which apparently worked as hammer was pretty much resting in it grave just two years later. shame ...but i still have a great fondness for the classic hammer period from 1957-1965.

being too young to have experienced the hammer films when they were fresh and new, i am discovering their hallowed horror films as i find them on dvd. i know it was almost a decade and half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original hammer dracula in this late entry to the christopher lee series. the original hammer vampire story had lots of atmosphere and a terrific story to get involved in. lee was a great dracula, a vibrant vampire if that possible, in the early outing but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that mostly stands around and looks threatening. the modish young people talk like cartoon characters (even though my aunt lived in england during the 1970s and she says people actually talked with those awful clichés). i had no interest whatsoever in who lived or died amongst the younger crowd. they were all pretty terrible characters anyway. i did enjoy seeing a young and charismatic caroline munro; but she leaves the story too early. lee and his historic nemesis peter cushing add an air of authenticity to the film but they can't draw blood from this empty film. it's d.o.a.

though i had sort of enjoyed the satanic rites of dracula (1974), i knew i shouldn't expect too much from its even more maligned predecessor! surely the least of the hammer draculas (marcus hearn on the audio commentary for the creeping flesh [1973] even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir!), the film really flounders due to its totally unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - updating of the myth (the modern-day setting actually suited satanic rites rather better)...even if, truth be told, it's still vastly preferable to dreck like dracula 2000 (2000) or van helsing (2004)!despite christopher lee's vociferous bashing of the film, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire (even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting); likewise, peter cushing delivers his usual committed performance. the only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by christopher neame (son of director ronald) as johnny alucard(!) - even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is! unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (both of them horror regulars) - stephanie beacham and caroline munro - can't rise above their physical attributes.the camera-work is by dick bush (who had shot the blood on satan's claw [1971] and, for hammer, when dinosaurs ruled the earth [1970] and twins of evil [1971] - but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with ken russell) which manages some nice atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage-ride scuffle at the (properly gothic) beginning; the hysterical black mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of dracula; and the final confrontation between lee and cushing's van helsing.

veteran british television director alan gibson's "dracula a.d. 1972" qualifies as one of the least appetizing entries in the hammer studios series about bram stoker's immortal bloodsucker. actually, this represented the first time since terence fisher's memorable "horror of dracula" (1958) that christopher lee and peter cushing fought each other as mortal enemies. they would reprise the same roles a few years later in the final hammer dracula: "the satanic rites of dracula." further, it was the second-to-last dracula for hammer in which lee performed as the infamous fangster. for the record, "dracula a.d. 1972" was the seventh hammer dracula.the exciting prologue from 1872 prepares you for something vastly different than what the rest of this disappointing horror flick yields. eternal rivals count dracula and his nemesis professor lawrence van helsing are literally at each other's throats atop a runaway carriage in london's hyde park for a vigorous opening scene that makes everything else look comparatively anticlimactic. the carriage crashes, and dracula emerges hugging half of a wooden wheel with its shattered spokes embedded in his chest. of course, christopher lee has to grip this broken wheel against his body, but the imagery is striking enough in its own way to pass muster. the count expires and so does his opponent van helsing. however, one of dracula's disciples snatches the count's ring and scoops some of the vampire's ashes into a vial for safe-keeping.don houghton's screenplay hurtles the action ahead a hundred years to swinging london in 1972. we meet a smarmy young man, johnny alucard (christopher neame of "no blade of grass"), who loves to raise hell with a group of hippies that crash parties and drive the british police with their antics. alucard happens to be the descendant of one of dracula's servants. now, alucard has the count's ring and a vial of his dehydrated blood. alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to arrange a black mass. he invites his trendy friends, among them laura (super sexy carolina munro of "the spy who loved me"), gayner (marsha hunt), and jessica van helsing (stephanie beacham) to attend this black mass because it offers them something different. not surprisingly, they resurrect the count, and the evil bloodsucker sets his eyes on jessica. meanwhile, after laura's body is discovered drained of blood, scotland yard inspector murray (michael coles of "doctor who and the dalkes") solicits help from van helsing's modern day offspring lorrimar (peter cushing). dracula wants to exact revenge on van helsing by taking the latter's granddaughter as his bride. lorrimar tracks down alucard; they fight in his chelsea apartment, and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water. remember, running water is just as lethal to vampires as sunlight and crucifix. van helsing finds dracula in the deserted church with his daughter awaiting the count. van helsing and dracula tangle. van helsing flings holy water into dracula's face. the vampire falls into an open gravesite with a stake awaiting him and he decomposes again.the chief problem with "dracula a.d. 1972" is that we don't get enough of lee as the count, though we do get considerably more of cushing as van helsing. furthermore, scenarist don houghton keeps dracula confined to the ramshackle church and never allows the vampire to venture out into the city. despite its low budget, "dracula a.d. 1972" could have been a lot better. the scene where the contemporary van helsing has to jot down alucard and spell it backwards to get dracula seems almost laughable. you'd think that he'd know about this backwards spelling trick. unless you are afraid of horror movies, this one will make you yawn. occasionally, gibson presents us with a superb close-up of dracula with his bared fangs and blood-shot eyes, but this is about as scary as this chiller gets, and that isn't saying much.

the idea of bringing dracula to contemporary times isn't bad--after all, it might revive the series a bit by injecting a new story element into a series that hammer has all but exhausted in a long series of generally excellent movies. however, because the present day turned out to be the crappy early 1970s, the results were pretty silly and looked more like love at first bite (a deliberate comedy). seeing christopher lee in a film filled with 70s hip lingo and electric guitar chords and laughable rock music just seemed beyond stupid. to make matters worse, the acting is much more over-the-top here--with an intense and silly performance by "johnny alucard". i also thought it was really funny that it took van helsing's grandson to notice that "alucard" is "dracula" spelled backwards--no one else figured this out for themselves! wow, what cunning!! so because so much of the movie was bad, why did it still earn an almost respectable score of 4? well, when the story came to the expected showdown between van helsing (peter cushing) and drac (christopher lee), it was exciting and ended very well. additionally, and i know this will sound very sexist, but if i had to watch a bad film, at least stephanie beacham's character wore some really nice outfits that revealed her ample...."talents", so to speak. so at least it was a pretty film to watch.by the way, the film ends with the phrase "may he rest in final peace" at the end, though this was not the final hammer dracula film with lee. he returned for "the satanic rites of dracula" just a short time later and it was in many ways even worse than this dud of a monster film.

if you first saw this movie with mary of the fourth form, then it's perhaps possible for the haze of nostalgia to encourage your charitable side. if not, it doesn't stand a chance. the young things' hipspeak is complete nonsense, people may have used the occasional word you'll hear here, but not huge batches of them in sentence after sentence. it doesn't so much date dracula ad 1972 as blow it to pieces, from the moment anyone under thirty opens their mouth it's impossible to take the film seriously and as for it being a laugh, it's not even a smile. the idea of throwing dracula into modern times is a good one and worthy of a far stronger script than don houghton can provide. the river thames and chelsea male are no match for puppet bats, model castles and terrified extras, but you can't help but feel that with better writing it would have been so different.

film starts off great in 1872 with a violent, bloody fight between dracula (christopher lee) and van helsing (peter cushing). dracula is impaled and dissolves to dust--van helsing also dies. somebody gathers dracula's ashes and buries them in the grounds of a church. cut to 1972--here's where the film falls apart.we are instantly hit over the head with loud, bad 70s music, horrible fashions and silly dialogue. when this was made hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get a hit. putting dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea. the fashions, music and dialogue date the movie horribly. we're introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their 20s who decide to have a black mass--"for a giggle". naturally they have it at the church (now abandoned) and naturally revive dracula. it's a good thing a descendant of van helsing is around...but dracula goes after his niece (stephanie beacham) in revenge.lee and cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever they're on screen the movie gets a much-needed shot of energy. the opening and ending battles are the highlights of the film (although the ending is spoiled a lot by playing lousy 70s music). also the main ringleader of the kids is named johnny alucard (christopher neame)--a truly stupid name that dates back to the 1940s. the film also has scream queen caroline munro looking absolutely great. the film is well-directed and pretty well-acted but the plot is stupid, the constant barrage of 70s fashion, dialogue and music gets annoying real quick and i was basically bored silly.most hammer fans agree--this was one of the worst dracula movies--it's followup (satantic rites of dracula) was the worst--and the last hammer dracula film. this gets a 2--just for cushing and lee.

in this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep hammer's dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power long time already, our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging london of 1972. exactly hundred years after he was destroyed by his archenemy van helsing, an occult disciple named johnny alucard (get it? get it?) gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church, among them van helsing's great granddaughter jessica, and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects dracula in a haze of smoke. dracula's only mission is to wreak havoc upon the entire van helsing lineage and fragile jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this. this is probably the only 70's film that goes immensely over the top in trying to look likea 70's film! considering the previous six dracula films were all set in the victorian era, director alan gibson really wants to stress the fact we're in the 20th century now and thus he stuffs his film with insufferable hippie-characters, hideous 70's fashion trends and awful 70's music. christopher lee and peter cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances regretfully show it. the opening sequence (a flashback) and the showdown climax are fairly enjoyable, but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary. the greatest elements in this series of films have always been dracula's dark castles and the exhilarating coach races and, obviously, this installment lacks all of that. luckily for the fans, hammer studios contemporary released other films revolving on vampires that are much better ("the vampire lovers", "twins of evil", "the legend of the seven golden vampires"). not recommended.

title: dracula a.d. 1972 director: alan gibson cast: peter cushing, christopher lee, stephanie beacham review: sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time. in this case...our time capsule is hammers dracula a.d. 1972 which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at home.the story is about these group of kids (were not a gang! were a group!) that love to hang out at a café shop called "the cavern". one day, johnny alucard (hmm strange last name...wait...it spells dracula backwards!) a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks. he offers them a night of black mass and black magic. to which they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". so in no time flat, the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashes.this movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home. he knows non of the people at his party, yet there they all are partying the night away in his house. doing drugs, making out and dancing on top of tables. the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time. everyone says words like "way out" and "groovy" and they finish many of their sentences saying "all that jazz". so yeah, its pretty evident that this is the 70s. to top it all off, there's a band that sounds something like "jefferson airplane"...i mean you'll be drowned in all things 70s. and as i watched this i kept asking myself "how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this?" and thats exactly what happens. old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs. many of the scenes in the film are great....but sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesn't fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things. something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element. that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for me.but all in all, putting all the distracting 70s music aside (an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered) the movie was pretty good. but i will mention this. the story was just a re-hash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula. in fact the story is damn near identical. lets see...a young lad inherits draculas ring and ashes...check. he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into...check. black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated church...check. the list of similarities goes on and on. so this movie ain't very original if you ask me.there are a few things that make this movie worth while though. for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining. i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. i couldn't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove! it made the movie fun for me, but we are here to get spooked, were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing. did we get any of that? well yeah. there's a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans. first off, there's the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic! they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled. that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment. then there's draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint. some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog. cool shot! i loved it! we have a cushing and lee face off at the end. and i couldn't help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air. i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula. its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other. and i think to myself, aren't their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero. oh well, anyhows, draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it, vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until there's only ashes left.all in all, an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film. its trapped in the 70s and though that makes it a fun watch (and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula) it still doesn't gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammer.rating 3 1/2 out of 5

after seeing the previews awhile back, i looked forward to seeing steve martin in a comedy that i thought might be a keeper. unfortunately, i was wrong. problem was, the previews were the only funny parts to the movie. the rest of the movie was pretty much a bunch of junk, scenes that have been done to death and characters we've all seen a thousand times.this movie was proof positive that if you put enough cash on the table, you can talk anybody into anything. steve martin is a favorite of mine but this one was a big clunker. the only actor in the movie who was worth watching was eugene levy; he was the best of a mighty lame group.

being a long-time steve martin fan, it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script. the screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it certainly is about the least imaginative movie i've seen in a long time - i knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began. the african-american stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well. but the thing that was the worst for me was to see martin in a movie without a trace of wit. he probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script. he must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort.

the previews were so funny that i couldn't wait to see this movie. i just got home and i have to say i couldn't have been more embarrassed at this movie. yes there were times where the jokes were funny, but the stereotypical roles were painful. joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the "negro spiritual" was just in poor taste. needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd (i was one of a very small handful of blacks).

(very serious spoilers)this movie was a huge disappointment. there are so many problems i dont know where to start. so, i'll talk about what is good about the film.the cast was great. steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy. queen latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black gal. and eugene levy, well he pretty much plays himself. add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well. and if watching these guys for 1.75 hours is worth $8 to you, then you wont be disappointed.but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes. first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone. all the white people are uptight bigots. all the black people are ghetto ebonics-speakers. the blacks are hip, cool, with-it and poor. the whites are nerds, stiff, and rich. (except eugene levy, he is clearly taken with queen latifa and "speaks the lingo" - so latifa nicknames him a "freak". so - if you're a white man and you like black women and you know street slang you must be a freak). the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character. she comes to martin's home under false pretense, but martin takes a liking to her anyway. she's supposed to be wrongly accused of robbery, martin takes up her cause. 3/4 of the way through the film we find out latifa's character escaped from jail. so, our sympathy for her goes out the window.there is no real plot. the movie plods along from scene to scene with latifa showing up in some place where she's "not" supposed to be (like a country club or martin's house) and martin trying to hide her. thats the running gag. then in the last minutes of the film they decide that they're going to finally deal with latifa's assertion that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery. martin goes under cover as a homeboy to extract a (let's face it, unusable) confession from latifa's ex boyfriend, and everyone lives happily ever after.finally (but there is a lot more wrong with this flick) this movie appears to be a hodge-podge of clips from other movies. the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin movie "the house-sitter". where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and shakes up his stodgy middle-class life. martin and latifa meet online - ala "youve got mail". the whole "quirky nanny fixes rich man's life" goes as far back as "the sound of music" and "mary poppins".i wouldnt see this movie again for free.

c'mon, let's put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest...it isn't funny. i was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations, and i'm not referring to the obvious black/white commentary in the movie, but to the slams towards other ethnicities, such as betty white's characterizations of the hispanics. should we just chalk up her agreeing to do this movie as a sign of senility...is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash? or is it the fault of the writers? how about the third assistant makeup person??? nope, the fault is with us for perpetuating this kind of crap (in the guise of comedy), that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough...racism is for real and it isn't a laughing matter. we're all different, let's celebrate that diversity, not poke fun at it and promote divisiveness.

steve martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor, and i loved "planes, trains and automobiles" and "bowfinger" --- but "bringing down the house" definately isn't one of martin's funniest works, and it doesn't even seem as if it's trying to be, which is just plain sad...i don't know; maybe i didn't like this movie because of the fact that i rented it along with "harry potter and the chamber of secrets" and "phone booth", both of which are excellent films, or maybe it's because i'm used to so much better from martin, or maybe it's just because i'm in a frickin' bad mood today...regardless, this film just wasn't very funny or entertaining, and i never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the film's gags, which is really a shame, since the previews of this comedy were so promising! i was expecting "bringing down the house" to be an all-out comedy bash, and i certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter-racial laughs from martin. instead, we're 'treated' to seeing queen latifah jiggle all over the screen, trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character. the funniest thing in this clunker is eugene levy, but even he doesn't get the screen-time he deserves.i would've really liked to enjoy "bringing down the house", but i didn't and i'd find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most die-hard steve martin fans. skip this one and rent "planes, trains and automobiles" instead...you'll have a much better time.

4 out of 10.this film was neither funny as a whole nor was it even worthing investing any kind of emotion into the characters. eugene levy is probably the most funny.... the rest of the cast do their jobs, but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that never get filled. this just wasn't very much fun, despite being funny at times.

hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film even if they have to keep dragging out stereotypes and putting them in the most impossible and stupid situations. this effort is a clear example of that and i really do believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible. story is about a divorced lawyer named peter sanderson (steve martin) who has been chatting with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her she turns out to be the opposite of what he was expecting. charlene morton (queen latifah) is a stocky black woman who has no intentions of dating peter but instead wants him to look at her case where she was convicted of robbery. he wants her to leave for good but she keeps popping up at inappropriate times and to save his job he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts involving her case.*****spoiler alert*****peter has his kids staying with him and charlene turns out to be helpful in raising them but suddenly a news bulletin announces that an escaped convict named charlene morton has broken out of prison. peter tells her to leave when the fbi comes snooping around but he figures out that she is in fact innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens him.this film is directed by adam shankman who keeps things moving at a nice pace and it is a good looking film technically speaking but the script is just so improbable and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film called "the landlord" is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess. i have always been a big fan of martin and i think he's one of the most talented persons around but he loves to work constantly and at times just seems to pick any script handed to him. on the other hand, i've always had a problem with latifah and the way she barges into the life of martin is so over the top that she instantly becomes ingratiating. basic premise that hollywood loves to use is the hip black person showing uptight whitey to loosen up and then pass on some street logic that will help them with their lives. that's basically what the story is here but of course they have to let martin dress black and overact like a retarded eminem because hollywood knows that this is what viewers want. well, i was pretty much insulted by everything in this film and it's not because i don't have a sense of humor but unfortunately (for hollywood, anyway) i use logic and common sense when i watch a film. yes, i enjoyed eugene levy's talking jive but are we really suppose to believe that he would be instantly attracted to latifah? i guess weirder things have happened and how many times does a main actor get shot only to be saved by something in their pocket? wouldn't a cell phone shatter if struck by a bullet? even if your the most die hard martin and latifah fan i wouldn't recommend this. i know i've said this before but this isn't an attempt to make a good film, it's an excuse to try and make money!

steve martin looks like he's had a face lift. something very strange about his face. i usually like anything steve does, but this movie comes off as trashy not funny. didn't think charlene encouraging him to be rough with his wife was a good message to be sending out to teens watching this film.

this was one of the worst films i can remember seeing. i am sure i have seen worse, though, if that mitigates me slamming it.the humor isn't funny, there are stupid stereotype jokes that, again, aren't funny. i was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film. it was a complete waste of time. i enjoyed martin in earlier films, but not this one. same for queen latifah, she was excellent in chicago and in set it off she was good too, but this role was horrid.i mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script. i feel strongly you can't save a formulaic, unfunny script with decent actors, this movie as a case in point. still, all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film. i am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted, made, released theatrically, and promoted.

talk about your wild life. barely a b-movie, but what the hay...corny sci-fi and lesbian sex. from the mind of writer and director cody jarrett, a cheesy slice of fun. a chemical company is dumping waste that is causing mutants in a fish farm. the hot kristi russell stars as dr. barbara michaels, an epa agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. she just happens to enter a lesbian relationship with bartender trixie(ariadne shaffer)and their love scenes are about as good as this film gets. a man-size frog incites chaos; causing a car crash, raping the chemical company boss's daughter, raping a girl under the bleachers at a football game, stiff-arm tackling a runner in the football game, raping a nun...all before being shot twice in the chest after an antidote was found all ready. the special effects...well, not special; a guy in a rubber frog costume without the genitalia to prove himself. tough tadpoles, do you still want to watch it? go ahead, but bribe any witness to secrecy.

i was truly looking forward to this title. it sounded and looked fun. the idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs, but instead this title only bores. first off, there is almost no froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment. i have to sit through 75+ minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the froggg humping a bare breasted chick. why? on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot. i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp, i wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue (creature from the black lagoon stuff), i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the froggg going on a killing spree, or it maybe escaping a silly trap. something exciting! geez, have fun with it, be creative! who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick? my advice to the filmmakers: keep going, your concepts are good, but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired. have some fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most important...put more creature in a creature movie!!!

i had high hopes when i went into the theatre-- having seen the trailer i was as hyped as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful premise.however, it's disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor composition of songs-the words are chunky and cheesy, probably because it was composed with a more western theme. i wouldn't find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with french or english lyrics. in mandarin, they just sound strange.the musical items were also cut together badly-- far too quickly to be enjoyable, and the shots of the actors looking anguished lasted far too long.the special effects are the next disappointment. suffice it to say, it is highly obvious where the special effects start and stop.it's not moulin rouge, and it's not in the mood either, inspite of the occasional (and very similar) slow waltz theme. altogether, and hour too long to tell a simple story.

the only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance. if you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another nicholas sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films, such as "message in a bottle," "nights at rodanthe," and "a walk to remember," think again. nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn't transform these characters. if anything, it makes them even more miserable than they were.a soft-spoken special forces army sergeant, john tyree (channing tatum of "g.i. joe"), has a memorable two-week fling while on leave from the military with an impressionable college girl, savannah curtis (radiant amanda seyfriend of "mamma mia"), who is spending spring break in south carolina. savannah doesn't drink, smoke, but she tells john that her head is filled with profanity. inevitably, john and savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep-inducing by any standard. tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class. just as they are getting hot and heavy between them, suicidal terrorists crash planes into the world trade center. john reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with savannah.meanwhile, another guy, shaggy but likable family friend tim (henry thomas of "e.t.: the extra-terrestrial") who has a motherless, autistic child named alan becomes the object of savannah's sentiment. she is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. she delays what seems forever before she finally contacts tyree with the eponymous letter. indeed, she dumps him for a man with a disease! later, she confesses to john that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry tim, so she doesn't make that fateful call. predictably, john agonizes over savannah's lack of communication. during a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in germany. while all this is transpiring, tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin-collecting father, mr. tyree (richard jenkins of "step brothers"), who suffers from asperger's syndrome. it seems that his father is on his last legs after john gets out of the hospital. the lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of tyree amounts to a pretty low blow. tyree, his father, and tyree's commander, keith robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance. "dear john" gives new meaning to lethargic love stories. yuck!

ok, it's watchable if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do. the suspension of disbelief required to get through this movie is significant though. first, in today's modern society do you believe college coeds get that committed to someone in that short of a period of time even if you are a "virtuous" habitat volunteer who likes autistic kids? and the 2 week romance blossoms into a letter exchange that leads to john's "conflict" of whether to re-enlist right after 9/11/01...really? he asks her what to do? every guy we know was not gonna be sitting on the sidelines after those towers came down(my husband was one of them and i love him and am proud of him for going) john's character is so flat. he's nearly expressionless the entire movie. he's good looking but not spec ops...he seems unsure not confident, quiet instead of a hell-raiser, no tattoos, gets into a "fight" with the preppy boys that is nothing more than a pushing match really...walks around without a cover on his head nearly the whole movie...and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulets upside down?). the war scenes are dumb...john and another guy heading off on their own...huh?, then other guy gets shot and john drags him 10 feet and starts giving buddy aid before securing the area or back-up arrival or even having their backs against cover...it's a gunfight for god's sakes, you don't stop fighting until its over...heck i wanted to shoot john in the back. back home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine...we hated her for removing her shirt in his presence...wth? break his heart and then tease him into adultery? she's a head case trollop. best part of the movie is when he drives away from her...at least he had some self respect and honor there. overall unbelievable story and we generally did not care about these characters or their love. dismal!

i was extremely excited for this movie! my expectations were under control because i read the book first sooo i expected differences. what i didn't expect were how great the differences were. starting off by the characters physical appearances...like channing tantums lack of tattoos n amanda seyfried not being a brunette lol but i let that go...the character developments were not there at all...you didn't have time to love amanda seyfried character and you couldn't feel for her or for john when they first separated...i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated that she left first then him...it took the emotional separation away...and why did they change tim from the book...why did they make him a dad instead of a brother and why did they make him sooo old looking and the movie lacked that intense moment when they find out what happens at the end (didnt want to spoil it lol but for those who watched it u know what i mean) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy did they change the ending...in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and it emphasized on channing tatums character's decision whhyyy did they twist it...it just made it look like a rushed ending...it was terrible...thats what disappointed me the most...the ending of the book should have been exactly the same :(

today, being president's day, my wife and i had "the notebook" dvd, checked out at our local library. it's a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar, as we are big movie goers. i'm a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book. i'd noticed references to "the notebook" in reviews of other movies which is why i brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity. we both really liked it. it made my wife cry; we could relate to many things in it with our own, continuing love affair and even i fought back choking up.this afternoon, after lots of chores, yard work and eating, we decided to actually catch a matinée. when we got to the theater, having seen most of the current batch of films playing, we elected to see "victoria day" which for some reason was not at the theater, even though both imdb and my phone movies showed it playing there. so, instead we looked at the poster for "dear john" and that it was written by the same writer as "the notebook", making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed 'tn' so much.what a disappointment! first, the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as 'tn'; and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities -- two dozen or so -- quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but, as another reviewer commented, "a poor man's notebook!" it had a real 'cash cow' feeling, meaning the sparks simply threw a story together, based on the exact template of 'tn' simply to make a quick buck. not only that, after the 'bug-eyed' trollop improbably 'dear john's-john' for the wimp cancer patient, we ridiculed the movie with each, passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end. there were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4:45pm monday matinée and my wife even told me to keep it down so i wouldn't ruin it for the others...it was so bad.seeing this on the heels of 'tn' ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and sparks blatant, cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious. we only wish we could've seen "victoria day" instead...no matter how bad it might've been after seeing this poor entry to cinema. and oh..., for the last 30-minutes, i kept saying "...don't give that cow the coins ...don't give that cow the coins?"

ok, let's start with the good: nice scenery, channing tatum is easy to look at, amanda seyfried has nice hair, that's about it. how much of this movie went on the editing room floor? probably the plot, action, good dialogue, and point. terrible acting, horrible choppy dialogue. let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who always cries at movies got to the part that was meant to evoke tears, and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying! the movie seems to want to take a stab at too many issues- war, loss, autism, cancer, but fails so miserably to cover any one topic satisfactorily. make sure you have something to munch on and your cell phone to return text messages!

after reading the reviews i am so relieved to know that i am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! i am a huge nicholas sparks fan, have read all of his books, most of them more than once. of course i loved the notebook and a walk to remember...i haven't yet seen message in a bottle or nights in rodanthe so i can't comment on those...but i did go see dear john this past weekend and i was terribly upset! the movie was not good at all! when looking at the movie alone, and not thinking about the book at all, it was still a terrible movie. i did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that i have got from other movies i enjoyed, especially the notebook. i was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared...ever! from the very beginning all i could notice was how they changed everything! the only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named john who is in the military and a girl named savannah who is not....the part about his dad being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book. everything else was totally off!!!! first of all, in the book, allen was tim's little brother, not his son! why they had to change that, i don't understand. it made a lot more sense how it went in the book when tim was just a little bit older than savannah and they grew up together and allen was savannah's inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic children....that didn't happen in the movie....ugh...and in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night...why did they leave those times out??? i could go on and on and on but then i would run out of space! so basically, if you are a great fan of nicholas sparks, don't waste your time or money on this movie...just read the book again...because it's terrible and nothing like the book!

we don't know if darlene loves all three gentleman, certainly they are wary of one another, yet they live together. viewers might surmise that the feelings of rivalry between the gentleman and the feelings of all of them toward darlene might make for an unbearable home life.in the eerily beautiful rural brazilian landscape (emphasized by the frequent use of polarization and the use of kodachrome stock), anything might happen, and the alternatives for any one of them. save perhaps ciro, may not be alluring enough to encourage them to change their circumstances. they seem to bear the intolerable because it is familiar-the unknown frightens them into complacency toward a fate which is more challenging than their characters can utilize. thus it crushes them, rather than strengthening them. the web in which they are caught is made of the sanguine filaments which bind us all. perhaps the sadness i felt after watching this movie has to do with it's portrayal of the inevitable fading of our youth's bright colors in the unforgiving light of time. the three children will enter the world fated to relive their parents lives to one or another degree. well filmed and portrayed, the story is tragic in it's essence. walt disney it ain't

i have to say that this movie was really quite awful. the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematography.i found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the cliché lines did nothing for me. the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and did'nt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie. the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary. the ending wasn't satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didn't make me feel anything for the characters. this movie was boring and did nothing for me, i recommend this movie to no one.

this 22 minute short, short of a precursor to the later much better "rock and rule", features two folk singer mice who are going nowhere. the female mouse, jan, signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star. so it's up to daniel mouse to save her soul. made in the late '70's this has all the trappings of said decade (crap music, crap clothing and hair style, awful folk tunes) this cartoon is featured on the second disc of the 2-disk collector's edition of "rock and rule", it also comes with a making of that runs almost as long as the show itself.my grade: d+

this film was reeeeeeallyyyy bad! was it meant to be a comedy as i couldn't help laughing the whole way through it? what a waste of two hours! donald sutherland was wooden not that he was alone, everyone else was just as bad...and how miscast was linda hamilton???

i clicked onto the encore mystery channel to wait for the movie i wanted to see, island of dr. moreau. i caught only a few minutes of shadow conspiracy. an old man runs to meet charlie and grabs him by the arm. suddenly, an assassin in a bright rain coat taps the old man in the head (with a side arm) from across the street. after waiting for "c" to turn around and look, the "a" tries to shoot "c" and clearly misses. "c" was a much easier target, the old man couldn't have run far. duh! there is a chase and "c" is on an elevator "a" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the cable, which is parallel to the "a". he hits and severs the cable, impossible. later, this time with a specialized rifle, the "a" lines up on "c" from maybe 50 meters, but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and taps the rider instead. how does charlie get his parts? does daddy go to the producers and say "look, my kid needs work..." it reminds me of his stupid sit - com. all the actors are good except, yup ... you got it. i usually have to endue 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for c.s.i. to come on. let's see, what can i do for the next hour. i know, i'll trim my toenails! much better use of my time.

i would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately i can't. who can write so bad scripts (i saw the movie five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be sutherland - needed to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in redford's movie, "ordinary people" and others ! -).though i don't like it, but i had no choice, i saw the movie in french, but i know that hearing the real voices of sheen, sutherland and hamilton would have not change things, except maybe making it more pitiful.what makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff (i forgot to speak about mr waterson, far away from the woody allen's movies he once used to play in).we had another movie on another french channel : a silly james bond with brosnan (i am not talking about the real bonds with connery(please it's the end of holidays, wake up !).

funny thing. charlie sheen, donald sutherland, sam waterston, and stephen lang have all had incredible performances. who can forget sheen as the callow naif in wall street, or sutherland as the the cynical korean war surgeon in mash? waterston and lang have both also had successful tv and film careers (law and order, killing fields, de niro's tribeca, etc). so what in the world would any of these fine actors be doing in a stink bomb like this?shadow conspiracy's plot of a washington coup d'etat is not really that bad, unoriginal maybe but not that bad. sure it's been done (seven days in may - a fine film!), but with a little tweaking, it could still have been entertaining. shadow conspiracy's main problem is in the execution. early in the film sheen, political strategist extreme, ridiculously and implausibly resolves a potential public relations gaffe by blackmailing a congressman. later, gunplay with lang's mute hitman tearing up half of what is supposed to be georgetown is explained on the news as "gang wars". has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in washington? sheen is about 20 years too young, way way too young, to be so senior in a white house administration. sheen's response to avert a political crisis is so ladened with false machismo, he looks as though he attended the david hasselhoff school of acting. and when was the last time gang wars spread to georgetown? we're talking about a section of washington where citizens voted against having a metro stop so that they could maintain their exclusivity.i agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button. i taped it off hbo a year ago and then took 3 separate viewings to plod through it.in summary: don't buy this film. don't even rent this film. if you see it at blockbuster, run away as fast as you can.

would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy? no? how about if i told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet. what? you don't believe me? ... ok. yes, i made that up. it's too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time - another movie equaled more money - as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton ... why? don't even get me started on stephen lang. he was so much fun as the party crasher in 'the hard way' and now this junk.ah no matter. everyone involved should feel ashamed. if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed - it's twisted - but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here. flat out, the story stinks and we're actually supposed to take this yak seriously. makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope. seriously, i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me. maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it's way to theaters!?oh ... sam waterson, how great you are in law & order. why are you here? demoting yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin. then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p. cosmatos who's "directing" credits include rambo: first blood part ii amongst other gems. hmm.... case in point?

rarely have i seen an action/suspense movie that was so boring. none of the action scenes are exciting the story line is nothing special and except for a couple of actors the acting is bad. charlie sheen (platoon, major league) stars as the white house chief of staff, who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead. donald sutherland (a time to kill, fallen) plays a friend who he tells everything he can and linda hamilton (linda hamilton, terminator, dante's peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. charlie sheen is ok as the star, donald sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance. linda hamilton gives a poor performance. with a bad movie, i can actually like it if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable stuff.

i still wonder why i sat through this entire thing. it only had about 3 minutes of actual entertainment, the rest of it was just a total bore. the acting isn't that great and the action scenes are soooo cheesy it's not even funny. i kinda wish i could say something good about this film but i can't think of anything right now. there probably was somethings in it some can enjoy but the ending of it is gotta be the dumbest idea ever. what type of person would get a little toy remote controlled helicopter with a burned in machine gun in it to assassinate the president? this idea could have never been done in the first place let alone have anyone dumb enough to try it, i guess the writer must have been to obsessed with the toy car scene in the dead pool but actually tried to make this look serious.

this film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc.i couldn't say the acting was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces by hamilton and sheen - but then i really wouldn't have to. risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains. still, if my life was flashing before my eyes, i think i would fast forward this 90 minutes.i have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published. yes, very resistant suit that sheen wears. i made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again.

this all looked quite promising. an up-and-coming presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders, as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the white house. it stars the excellent donald sutherland among several capable actors. yet very few people have a good word to say about it.the whole thing really needed some depth. you can pick up the idea that the president is being too left-wing with his ideas, and some within the government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out. conrad appears to simply want the country to be governed his way, rather than the way of the elected leader.however, the action scenes had a few logic holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather haphazard assassination method - and linda hamilton's character is completely uninspired. her 'the president's my father' 'diversion' was ludicrous - that would make the president about 10 when that happened. worse still was her predictable final scene with bishop.they could have made a challenging, inventive political thriller, but either bottled it or failed. they could've gone to town on special effects, but the good ones were wasted. they could have achieved so much more in general. this was barely worth the £1 it cost me.

reading through most of the other reviews, i tend to agree with most of the comments. the one thing that i would add is the disjointed way the movie has been directed and produced. i think that some of these new wave movie makers think that they are being clever using unusual (sometimes jerky) camera angles, and flitting from one scene to another. it goes down well with these movie festivals, and with some of these indie type critics, but it spoils the movie for me. i noticed in the reviews, one comment saying that none of this movie makers films have become blockbusters. this would maybe prove my point, as the film has that 'rushed to finish' feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film appears to be lacking a smooth flow. as for the comment about kiefer sutherland being a big name to put on the poster, i would bet he cringed when watching the final cut. this is a story with real potential, spoilt by trying to be different in it's production. worth watching, but not many would come back for a second view.

set in the mid 1800's when the british is clearing new zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies. the daughter of a british army surgeon, sarah(samantha morton), falls in love with the son of one of the maori leaders. the maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for the europeans to deal with. by the time sarah's child, which she calls "boy", is born, his father is dead. by the age of six, "boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and sarah will begin her search for him with a man(kiefer sutherland),who is deeply in love with her.two-time oscar nominee morton is definitely the star of this movie. sutherland is a total waste. also starring are: cliff curtis, stephen rea, temuera morrison and david rawiri pene. this movie is rated r for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. i find the title river queen very misleading and the dvd cover with sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime.

as the above suggests, i was ultimately unimpressed with this movie. it is lovely to look at, the scenery is lush, but the detail of the story, in particular the characters, are totally unbelievable. films don't have to be believable, but films like this, with a political edge and social commentary do. similarly, i have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again, films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw. this is absolutely the case with sutherland, who is frankly rubbish as doyle. his accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent is his performance, and we end up with a caricature of irishness with no personality outside of his nationality. i find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job. all in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when you're trying to be the mission, this kind of thing wrecks your chances of success.speaking of accents, there were a couple more problems, one being the striking modernity of boy's accent which acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time. more surprising was samantha morton's much lauded irish accent, which was variable to say the least. her voice meandered between strong north and soft south, even in the voice-overs, where i would've expected any such discrepancies to be picked up.however, these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of sarah. she never seems at home with the english, and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a no-brainer. perhaps a lot has been lost in editing, perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things could've been fleshed out, but i can only judge what i've seen.now the biggest problem, sarah's (morton) relationship with doyle (sutherland) is incomprehensible. the fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son, the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me. as you may have guessed. this movie didn't work at all for me, but it is top notch to look at, you really won't see anything more stunning in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife liked it.

kate is a jaded young woman who has trouble meeting and dating guys. throughout the movie, you get to meet several of her loser boyfriends. and throughout the movie, you are subjected to kate's cynical negative outlook on love and relationships. this negative viewpoint is continued throughout and presented as ultimate truth. i had a real problem with this. why would anyone want to be taught about love, life, and dating from someone who is obviously so messed up? it would work if that was the joke, but it is not. for the jokes in the movie (which are neither funny nor original) to work at all, you have to believe what kate is saying: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad or no sex, that the highest level a relationship can evolve to is when you are able to fart in front of your partner... you get the idea.there is no movie in recent memory that comes close to upsetting the stomach as much as love & sex. why did the filmmakers waste their time on such trash? every joke in love & sex is something that i have experienced in another movie or in my own life. there is nothing original or creative about the story, the production, or the style. it is cynical, dumb and pointless. mind numbing!

to keep from being bored during "love and sex," first i tried to think of all the movies this was imitative of: "breaking up" with russell crowe and salma hayek (though that had a more original ending), "about last night" with rob lowe, and a lot of tv shows. second was admiring just how gorgeous framke janssen is so i couldn't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date. she is certainly in line to give julia roberts a run for her money, literally-- and wasn't julia in some movie with this same plot or other? third was trying to figure out why the writer/director bothered to give jon favreau's character the jewish name of adam levy; he even refers admiringly to eating a ham sandwich.fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why i was in the theater.(originally written 9/2/2000)

maureen o'hara is always beautiful and appealing. here she plays an actress terminally ill. we don't know with what.it is a bit of a precursor to "love story" in that respect.william bendix is good, as is most of the supporting cast. john payne is meant to be grieving but he seems to sleepwalking. the girl who plays the child he and o'hara adopts does her best with a contrived plot device: of course! adopt an orphan. she will live on after the passing of your wife. it's a sweet movie but it doesn't feel sincere.i was hoping to be moved. i was, by o'hara's gentle performance. but i don't like to feel manipulated.

before "miracle on 34th street," maureen o'hara and john payne made this, this, this film. i was going to describe it, but can't find words for how badly this film turned out. the subject matter of adopting a child and maureen's illness are both very serious and sensitive issues, but that notwithstanding, this could have been done a whole lot better than it was. it was so extreme in its portrayal that it didn't come across as real at all. probably its problem started with a weak script.another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie. (see my review of "a stranger in my arms.") the beautiful o'hara was often saddled with clunkers like this, another being forbidden street (britannica mews,) which i may review eventually.if you have any emotional ties to this from childhood, you'll be kinder to this rather lifeless, colorless, and lackluster film. but for something along the lines of this, maybe you can find its tv-movie remake. it has to be better. it has to be.

oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies... i don't even remember how many i've seen. maybe it sells... but not to me. not scary at all. the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these... also the pulling of the kid. i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies. cellphone scene is also nothing new... the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked... i mean it lacked all dramaticness... ok this is for kids 14-16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique... we'll let me tell you. there's a million of you =d this is one of them. 3/10 i've seen worse but you won't be missing anything by not seeing this!

if this is not heavily featured on every list of "what not to watch", it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence, which, as long as that remains so, is the acceptable alternative. i'm not kidding you, this is a *bad* "movie". joseph meeker returns from the dead, with various vague, undefined supernatural powers, the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new, increasingly comical-looking and ridiculous(and never scary or creepy... in general, when this goes for the latter of those, it winds up just being bizarre, and attempts at the former just don't work, period) outfits and stereotypes/archetypes, and he is portrayed by david keith(whom i respect in... well, at least daredevil), doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent(which could also have to do with script) and often over the top performance. a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch. the editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is(and what on earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks?). cinematography... oh, dear. framing, coverage, effective use of angle(that one could be attributed some to editing, too, perhaps), please, guys, stop me when i say something you've ever heard about the existence of. as far as the technical side goes, this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than unexposed film. but why stop there? the plot is just poor. the basic idea's been done, and it's been done so much better than this(the crow would be one). the way it's told is gimmicky, and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks, it still doesn't satisfy. pacing is about non-existent. the lead is distinctly unlikeable, and there's more personality in a barn door, not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden. kelly perine and thomas ian nicholas? what in the name of all that is good and just(pun intended) are you doing in this? perine, you were already funny before this, on the drew carey show, nicholas, well, i haven't seen you in anything preceding american pie, but if nothing else, you *were* funny later on, and in those productions, the amusement was intentional. dialog is... the less said, the better. language is unrestrained, and tends to be stupid. the violence is shoddily done, and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it(hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy). characters, don't get me started. why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting, at times utterly illogical, events? the more you think about this, the worse it gets. it's not even passable as a "bad horror flick", or a b movie(it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet, and go further still), it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine. i recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is, and don't say i didn't warn ya. 1/10

before i begin, let me get something off my chest: i'm a huge fan of john eyres' first film project: shadowchaser. the film, a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).judge and jury begins with joseph meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called "bloody shootout" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  michael silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). but once executed, meeker returns as a revenant (or as kelly perine calls "a hamburger without the fries"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making silvano's life a misery.let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film. it is a supernatural action film, with meeker chasing silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator, a french chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle), to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife.director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. but that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. the acting is surprisingly good, with keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by kove, as well as paul koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.

the main character is a whiny, irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party. she loses it at the drop of a hat, acts pathetic, is schizophrenic, and left me wondering why on earth she doesn't understand why these 'friends' of hers haven't called her in three years. (get a clue, sister - you're a juvenile mess!) i couldn't stand her or the friends. i never felt connected to any of the characters. to make the entire movie even more unbearable, someone went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity (this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decade!)the acting wasn't awful, but not really believable either, and in the end the only thing that i did care about was the two hours i'm never going to get back. don't waste your time - go catch up on a dentist appointment instead!

a woman who deals in art starts to have a passionate love affair with a man named john. they make love everywhere they go and they play sexual games. the problem i had was that was all they did. there was no plot at all to this movie or i just didn't see it. the hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie but i wanted something else to happen. perhaps he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret. i just needed something and all that there was was a bunch of love making scenes. not that's it was bad or anything, i just wanted more things to happen in the movie. perhaps a coworker was sleeping with him too. anything! i was greatly upset that this was all that there was. mickey rourke was so hot back then. i wonder what happened.

i can't really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie. a woman meets a man, he wants to play games, she too, but only until she realise what she's missing. she leaves, and that's it really. it took 9 1/2 weeks before elizabeth (kim basinger) left john (mickey rourke). she should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery.

the only reason i bought the dvd was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when liz (kim basinger) strips to the music of joe cocker: you can leave your hat on! that was the best part of the whole film. not because the scene was any good; only the song. i am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good. disappointingly so!especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon. instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels obscurely from one idea to the other. for example when john (played by rourke) is able to leave her on the top of the big wheel, liz (kim basinger) is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of john's sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing liz; and like one reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing. this "dangerous" side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong. the theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well.is the film sending the message out that this kind of "foreplay" is fine! if the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad-masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point. instead the film awkwardly jumps from one "sizzling" scene of rourke feeding basinger and blindfolding her to another. in a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is maybe trying to relate; thus for me it doesn't have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas.

kim basinger and mickey rourke star in this controversial story of a wall street exec and an art gallery employee who hook up and begin a very experimental sexual relationship.while the acting by rourke and basinger is ok, the flim doesn't allow their characters to truly form. allegedly there was a lot of film left on the cutting room floor that delved deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them - basinger's character considering suicide - that would have made the characters more involved for the viewer. as is it is a glossy, well produced, with mtv style editing piece of soft core voyeurism. 4 of 10

this is high-gloss soft-porn; a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing: sex. they actually made sex boring, sad to say, because i defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was. what this is, is an excuse for kim bassinger to show off her great body and for mickey rourke to smirk a lot. that's it. rourke's smugness is so bad it's sickening and bassinger, despite the great figure, looks cheap more than beautiful.kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - it's unable to compensate. let's face it: this movie was made for only reason - to titillate male viewers. on that level, it probably succeeded. if i recall, it's why i gave it a look being a fan of bassinger's looks, but i actually expected a story, too.those trying to pass this off as "arty" and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves.

what's up with this movie? does mr. lyne and his writers think that a sado-masochistic fling between two screwed up yuppies can carry a feature length movie? maybe if it had some comedic elements (which is doesn't, at least intentionally), or there were some additional dramatic elements (which there are not), or maybe if it was hardcore. no, it's simply the history of the affair; a chronology of a bunch of r-rated trysts. ho-hum, who cares? "nine ½ weeks" deserves every razzie nomination it got. it's a loser.and by the way, what's up with roger ebert and his rave review? where was his head back in 1986?

mind-numbingly boring, utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable. that pretty much sums up the disaster that is indecent proposal. starting with a decent premise the whole thing just unravels and becomes a complete mess. basically the story boils down to the question, "would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars?" here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie. quite frankly, we'd have been better off if we didn't have a movie.our married (and financially troubled) couple are played by woody harrelson and demi moore. they go to vegas to get rich. yeah, that'll work. anyhow, a billionaire, played by robert redford, takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer. for one night with the wife he will give them financial security. the aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. the script is so predictable you can say the characters' lines before they do. the performances leave much to be desired. harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. and it is quite safe to say that demi moore will never have to clear space in her home for any academy awards. why is she a movie star again? in a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none. only redford escapes mostly unscathed. he's appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch. but he can't save this film. awful script, lousy acting, plodding pace, zero entertainment...indecent proposal is downright awful.

this was one of the biggest pieces of crap i have ever had to watch. i mean, seriously. how would anybody else feel if they were in woody harrelson's shoes and your wife was even considering it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. after all, she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money. woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it. how can you trust her? who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married? i don't care how desperate they were. that's the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life. then, he flips out on her. apparently, he had no right to mistrust her, other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome. oh and wait, then he's supposed to apologize to her after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. of course woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has roy hobb's card in her wallet. then, at the end of the movie, she's apparently so in love with woody still and misses him so much, that she was not going to leave hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave, and she bleeping thanks hobbs???? are you bleeping kidding me? was she under contract as his sex slave or something?? i mean what the bleep?? oh and wait it gets better. she bleeping kisses him passionately before she gets out of the car. yea, she's not a whore. oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go make out with you one last time for good ole' sake. smooch smooch, smooch even though i'm still married to a guy i left for a rich guy. i have never seen such a piece of crap in my life. how the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending? what was this movie supposed to represent? nothing came out of this! this was the most pointless movie i have ever seen in my life. two pathetic desperate people. if i were woody, i would tell her to go drown herself in that body of water they were near. apparently, he had no self respect. what the hell was roy hobbs thinking by taking this horrible role. i feel like puking after watching this. this movie was so bad, it was seriously laughable. i want those two hours of my life back that i wasted watching this piece of ****.

a good example of the differences between american and foreign cinema can be seen in a film i recently watched on television: indecent proposal.indecent proposal's two protagonists, david and diane murphy are played woody harrelson and demi moore. i'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well, but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me. love, affection, playfulness, attraction  none of these materialized on screen in their interactions together.since i knew that eventually robert redford would show up, it was clear from the beginning that the good part, the meat of the movie, would be the scenes between him and demi moore. poor woody harrelson just could not muster any emotion at all for the film. he seemed to be holding back, preoccupied with his receding hairline.ok, so fast forward. what idiots these two (diane and david) are for thinking they can win back the $50,000 they owe by gambling. no acting faux pas there, just hideously bad, lazy, unforgivable writing. of course they lose all their money. surprised? i know i wasn't. enter robert redford (john gage in the film)  a romantic, perhaps emotionally frigid man, an updated gatsby. a very good role and though not a great, great actor, next to those two, redford looks like olivier. he immediately falls in love and lust with diane and we the viewers for once feel it. this is how to love a woman! not david's way, trading gum mouth to mouth with diane on a slimy pier. (did i see that right?) as gage, redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. yes it's meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a rich man, but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it! other wardrobe symbolism includes david's now-ironed shirts at the end of the film, signifying resolve, getting it together after a long interlude of forlorn wrinkled shirt wearing.and what is it with california garden parties as depicted in hollywood movies? suddenly everyone appears british, complete with lacy dresses, three piece suits for the men, hats (hats!) and of course the parasol. yes diane, her transformation to rich man's fiancée now complete, is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol. though she insisted that she couldn't be bought, she succumbed at last to the sexual tension. here is where the film branches off into pure americana. i mean, of course david and diane will end up together, my question is: why? diane was bored with david, why not let her ride the robert redford wave? and i mean for a good long while? how can she pull herself out of the sexual-romantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily just because woody harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party, sits himself down and looks demi moore in the eyes. that's just not how it goes. he was so weak.but we must have our happy ending. we have to swallow the moral lesson. we're not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise. director lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the juvie set, the young'uns.in addition to garden parties in which there's nary an suv, tee shirt, or baseball cap in sight, such films also feature a reliable public transportation system that connects far-flung california cities and municipalities. how else to symbolize the return to middle class or working class life?

this story had the potential of a good film. the difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one. however the movie was ruined by the horrible miscasting of robert redford as the villain who offers $1,000,000 to sleep with demi moore. like redford has to pay for it. redford's boyish good looks and all american charm just don't cut it as an unlikeable, threatening, boor. redford's acting skillls are insufficient to make his character menacing. i can see it now, $1,000,000 to sleep with robert redford. ok says the lady but you will have to give me some time to raise the money. jack nicholson would have been perfect as the sleazeball.

this movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements. this movie is a jumpy horror flick with no meaning at all. the slashes are totally fake looking. it looks like some 17 year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old kid shot it. with the worst acting you can ever find. people are tired of knives. at least move on to guns or fire. it has almost exact lines from "when a stranger calls". with gruesome killings, only crazy people would enjoy this movie. it is obvious the writer doesn't have kids or even care for them. i mean at show some mercy. just to sum it up, this movie is a "b" movie and it sucked. just for your own sake, don't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie.

i found this movie to be mostly a p.o.s.it was low budget,but that isn't the problem.the problem is,the movie is just lame.it doesn't really make a lot of sense.yes,it does explain why things happened,but that's not what i mean.there was just no reason for it all.the movie also moved very slow.the last ice age was quicker than this.also, i think they went overboard a bit in the kills.i don't mean they were too gross,but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head,or stabbing his victim. maybe i'm being petty,but i just didn't like the movie.the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of "when a stranger calls" and maybe that was the whole point.but so what.for me "when a stranger kills" is a 4/10*

to sum it up in a nutshell, this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes.the acting was sub-par, the only decent actors of the bunch being trisha, the killer and molly. the music was slightly lame but fitting and the special effects were much too overused. the story/scriptwriting was poor, the unnecessary torture/romantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing ending.the start of the film was rather slow, the fake-looking gore not much of interest. trisha arrived at the house, and there was some premise for a good storyline.trisha started to receive the threatening phone calls, which heightened the suspense. this momentary suspense, the best feature of the movie began to build, but then the friends crashed the place, wrecking all potential suspense/horror in the film.the plot then becomes obtuse from here on. chemistry sparks between the two couples, and then the killer picks off frank and the other girl. this scene was dragged on and unnecessary.the killer then makes her way for trisha and ties her up. there is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long. as the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all, and it bores more than shocks.in summary, the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this film.3/10.

"when a killer calls" is an unusually nasty slasher flick, with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences. the decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of "when a stranger calls" by pretty much putting in -- almost word for word -- the phone call sequences from that movie. they seem very forced.additionally, the filmmaker commits the cardinal (but all too common) sin of having the heroine's friends being repulsive jerks. so for the beginning of the film, we really like and are rooting for the babysitter (a nice believable job by rebekah kochan), but then she's joined by standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is ruined.the flick sort of works, but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you'll be expected, so be fore-warned.

there is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities. they are all self-centered, obnoxious or two dimensional. my husband watches it, claiming that there is nothing else on, but i would rather watch nothing.the only sitcom that i can think of that was worse was yes, dear. at least that one didn't get 9 seasons.being overweight does not make a comic genius, and kevin james does not have the talent of john goodman, jackie gleason or john belushi. leah remini may have talent, but if so, she is wasted on the shrewish wife. jerry stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. maybe there is a reason for that.this is a perfect example of why sitcoms are derided.

i saw the movie after checking its rating on imdb. back then, it was at 8.0 and i thought, "wow! that must be a good one". i thought wrong. the beginning of the movie actually keeps what the plot promises, but then it goes exponentially down underneath its basement. i think without the character of richie nix, it might have been alright - although he is the reason the story line takes the course it does. the character is just too extreme for my liking, and hard to endure. also, the journey the main character takes from the beginning of the story till its "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been omitted - the alternative is, i just did not understand the movie.although i must admit that it is "easy watching", and i had no problems sitting through the whole movie, when it had finished i was somewhat unimpressed by the ending. all in all, rather mediocre.

so, as far as i gather, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people, and this is just as scary as the paranormal. the "paranormal" imagery associated with the villain, donnie, is purely symbolic. he's actually just a normal human being.the problem is that i just don't buy it. donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal. he's not even that scary at all. as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has only newly become a murderer, he's significantly less disturbing than most well-known real-life serial killers (eg: he's like a very watered-down version of ed gein). which is why scully's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off (something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine), before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all, is completely out of character. she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches.so, as comic book guy says... "worst episode ever!"

here's what's good about "the slaughter rule:"--ryan gosling, clea duvall, and david morse all give great performances. gosling is, as always, pretty darn outstanding. the locales are often breathtaking.here's what's bad about "the slaughter rule:"--everything else. the script is horribly muddled. and while i can certainly appreciate a non-"feel good" movie, this movie is just boring. great performances can't make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make it sense. just getting through the first hour became a chore.i stuck with it because of gosling, but eventually i did myself a favor and changed the channel. spoilers on here relayed the ending to me. i didn't miss much. do yourself a favor--if you want a good gosling flick, check out "the believer."my score: 2 out of 10.

ok, so i saw this movie at this year's sundance, and i was sorely unimpressed. it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham-fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close-up of ryan gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. after the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watch-able albeit not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. the highlights certainly include both gosling and morse's acting, gosling being an up-and-coming star, and morse being an extremely well-established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. as a sidenote, after the screening i was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind me--he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject.

big disappointment. clash by night is much to talky and stagy and the dialog doesn't resonate as true coming from these characters. this is melodrama at its peak. the acting is truly over the top and very unreal. only marilyn monroe and keith andes as supporting players give this film any zip. wish they had more to do. i'm somebody who looks at details in films. two big questions...1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working, then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father? 2. when stanwyck is packing to leave town, why is she seen packing at her brothers place where she hasn't lived for at least two years? also, when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre, who's taking care of the baby again? such details really irritate me and cause me to give films much lower ratings. what were the writers, directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking? nuf' said.

i've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems, in the cruel light of 2007, a very sloppy late-rko assembly-line product. all that endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. the editing is downright careless: scenes just end, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. the dialog bears the stilted traces of the odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. but what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. i love stanwyck, but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. douglas, overplaying at being lovable, then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy, as is ryan, snarling and shouting most unnaturally. the less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: keith andes, whose character is kind of a neanderthal by today's standards, nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as stanwyck's (much younger, one presumes) brother, and marilyn monroe, as his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. on monterey's windswept coast (and all that monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the town looked like), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. a final point, and a spoiler: perhaps the breen office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey, but i give the marriage a month.

so many people have taken shots at platoon and born on the fourth of july among other calling them "leftist propaganda film." now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. to me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.the acting and writing was a little to clichéd for my liking. mel gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner randall wallace for yet another one. throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical "just tell my family i love them" or "tell ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed" lines. the was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that i felt like i had to vomit. how about that scene were gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this "no colors" applies to what to put in the washing machine. its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. another scene is were gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.the directing displayed this all perfectly. the countless scenes of gibson and his family or soldiers praying. i'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while i wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. how many scenes with the american flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. the director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in vietnam. what exactly was won their. the cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the american flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. i love america but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.this may seem like a rant and maybe it is but i cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. this movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. to me it says if your not christian your wrong. would god or jesus want people to kill i don't think so. to me this movie was offensive. at first this movie was funny with the countless clichés and overacted scenes but then when i looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. i guess though it is my fault that i chose to watch this movie. i hope no one takes this comment offensively because i am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.if you want a real depiction of the vietnam war watch platoon, born on the fourth of july, apocalypse now, the deer hunter or the killing fields. even full metal jacket which i absolutely hated was a better depiction. i have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong. a real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.

does anyone remember braveheart ? it starred mel gibson who also directed and was scripted by randall wallace . the film contains over 200 errors . does anyone remember the green berets ? that`s the john wayne western where the duke saves a homestead called vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . if you watch we were soldiers you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .first of all what`s with that scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? i mean what`s the connection between scotland and `nam ? maybe wallace is using it in the vain hope that because braveheart was bombarded - undeservedly i might add - with several oscars then so might this film ? whatever reason it`s included it really jars . gibson plays hal moore as a cross between william wallace and john wayne and i was expecting him to say something like " they`ll never take our freedom - the hell they will " and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with the green berets like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the wayne moviewhen not reminding the audience of other movies wws also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in america not asia . hal moore might have brushed up on the french experience in indo-china but if that`s the case then he was unique because the american military went out of their way not to read up on the french indo-china war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict westmoreland replied he had nothing to learn from the french " who haven`t won a war since the days of napoleon " so i was confused as to the portrayal of the nva in this movie , when in 1965 the american high command , brimming with hubris held the north vietnamese and vc in contempt . it`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of vietnam are superlative warriors . they are , but very few americans believed this in the mid 1960sthere`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? no bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the la drang valley . likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the americans out number the nva ? i put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . take the scene where the american burned to a crisp is flown away screaming " tell my wife i love her " . this should have an emotional impact similar to that death scene in platoon but here there`s no impact . in fact i found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words " tell my wife ... " while mutilated or dying , i counted at least two other characters use the phrase . did characters actually say this at the battle ? i`ve no idea but since randall wallace wrote the script i do have reservationsi sat in shocked awe watching apocalypse now , platoon and the killing fields made my eyes water , i laughed at full metal jacket , i kept looking at my watch with the deer hunter , and after seeing we were soldiers i felt totally patronised

coltrane and idle are members of a bank robbery gang who double cross their leader during a robbery. they hide out in a nunnery school and disguise themselves appropriately to avoid detection from the mob and the police. alot of catholic humor and slapstick but the script is kinda thin as are the laughs.. there is a good shower scene though... on a scale of one to ten..4

this film has been compared to the hilarious british comedy "a fish called wanda", although i can't see why. the only connection i can find is the monty python one (eric idle in "nuns", john cleese and michael palin in "wanda"). otherwise the two are incomparable.idle and robbie coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead, so they decide to rip off their boss and make for rio. when the getaway goes wrong, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns.what at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable, average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humour. once again there are the occasional high spots, but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings. an attempt at a "wanda" type manic finish fails too, along with the effort at "men in drag" humour, which is hardly surprising. when you think about it, men trying to be women is funny, men trying to be nuns is ridiculous.friday, april 22, 1994 - video

eric idle, robbie coltraine, janet suzman - it should have been almost impossible to go wrong. of course it has some funny moments - the scene in the showers when robbie coltraine echoes lon chaney jr's ghastly werewolf line "i can't help myself" is hilarious. but ultimately the plot, script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 "hail mary"s. when i was a child, carry on films filled this niche slightly better, which is a really sad indictment of a film with such a promising cast.

first of all let us discuss about the story. it is a copy of the movie "hitch" with an added indian flavor to it. one guy, who is a love guru, and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies, and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. salman khan is the love guru, and govinda is the lame guy.now coming to artists' performance, salman khan overacts throughout the movie, he tries to be funny, but fails big time. you can see salman shouting throughout the movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. govinda pairs opposite katrina kaif(oh, my god, she is one heck of a girl. a real beauty)is in real life a 50 year old dude, and katrina is a girl in her early twenties. in the movie govinda looks like grandpa of katrina kaif. what a pity! coming to execution of the movie. this movie feels like a b-movie, and a poor imitation of the movie hitch. where hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this movie is shallow and purposeless, nowhere there is justification or clarity.just forget this movie, for it is nothing but boring, typical bollywood fare. actually i give 3/10 because this is the lowest i go.

this movie is widely admonished as being a copy of the will smith feature hitch. that movie was dull.this movie isn't so much dull as unbearable. govinda looks way past his prime. he is not at his best doing roles like this. it is similarly unconvincing as his performance in deewana mastana.salman khan is at his eye-aching "best". and that's in the few scenes where he remembers to put clothes on. it could only have been through nepotism that this eye-sore's scenes could be saved from the trash bin of any movie's cutting floor.another case of bollywood embarrassing itself with it's shameless cloning. another case of the bollywood audience majority embarrassing themselves by making this a hit.

this movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. i wouldn't call it a movie, it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories, which are not all that funny. there're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. he's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1/2 hours. i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy.i think this movie is just an extended version of "hitch", padded with a lot more characters and dancing.if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made, then i'm pretty sure i'm not interested in any of his previous ones.

the movie is not bad in itself...till you see the original movie hitch(2005) starring will smith. the movie is a straight copy with even the dialogs for most part of the movie simply translated from english to hindi! the plot in the original is tightly executed. the hindi version fails to keep the viewers interested. the over-the-top kind of comedy of david dhawan seems to have gone overboard with govinda hysterically shouting at all times...sometimes more time is spent in understanding the reason for that than the plot. :)if you know english, which i assume you know given that you are reading this, see the hollywood original. at least watch "hitch" if you have watched partner to be able to compare. this is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, i am sad to say, is shamelessly lifted by "inspired" people like david dhawan.

the supposed writer and director mr.dhawan has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster hollywood movie "hitch" starring will smith. many scenes are also exactly the same. the plot was just copy pasted and some low grade humor(probably mr.dhawan's own creation) and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standards.although salman khan and govinda's acting did give us some smiles, however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of plagiarism, specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying pirated discs!

i do not remember, at least in the last ten years or so, a movie that i have liked less than mama mia. from the non-existent acting to the atrocious singing, i was cringing at least once per minute. i don't believe i could even recall one brief segment that i tolerated. i do know that i will never watch this disaster again. i cannot believe that with such high expectations due to the talent - colin firth, meryl streep, pierce brosnan, that a movie could be such a flop. but to see the lack of acting skills shown, the seemingly drug-induced dancing, and then, horrors of horrors, to hear the singing of pierce brosnan(!), i cannot see how this movie will not make it into the hall of shame. definitely, a movie that never should have been made, and just in case you missed it the first time, one that i will never watch again.

i cannot remember a more trivial, mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind. how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others ? only if they don't like admitting they made a mistake. it seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations. no real substance to it all happy and shallow. yeah that'll please the masses. well not this member of the masses. what a trivial load of drivel. i wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. and to think i paid £7 to see this ! i think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days. so i like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what ?

having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the dvd for my wife for xmas, i had to watch it. i did not expect much, which usually means i get more than i bargained for. but 'mamma mia' - utter, utter cr**. i like abba, i like the songs, i have the old lps. but this film is just terrible. the stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced cliff richard's musicals in the sixties!meryl (see me i'm acting)streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! her grand piece - 'the winner takes it all' - is meryl at the met! note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan! some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. the camera cannot stop moving like bad mtv. one can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. but what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot? blair, campbell and new labour really have reduced the uk to zombies - critical faculties anyone???

this movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an abba soundtrack - yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing. the musical presentations in the movie, southpark, was much better than in mama mia. the director of mama mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need are abba songs.just to give a sample of the awfulness: an aging meryl streep is shot with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. why do that to one of the most talented actresses out there?

after sitting through this film, i have decided that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i knew it the moment i was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they (omg!) meet again, and then watching the same thing, only done by women old enough to be my mom. and that was only the first few minutes. yeesh. so here are my comments...1. middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.2. pierce brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag. nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement, for that matter.3. the songs were so random. it was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy nilly, into the incredibly contrived and stupid plot.4. my three year old nephew could have written a better script.i was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie. and i normally really like movie musicals. of course they are bound to be a bit corny...but this was ridiculous. what a waste of talent. i mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie...i am embarrassed for them that this is now a part of their career. i regret wasting my money and time on this piece of crap.

i love musicals, all of them, from joyous oklahoma, to poignant porgy and bess, to the touching romantic "damn yankees." and i know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.in a "real" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. it is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. so, in guys and dolls, "my time of day" describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.for this lover of the broadway musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. there, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. while here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals. they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in "sweet charity."let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. perhaps, another day, another mood, i could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.but i can't help but imagining what richard roger, oscar hammerstein, cole porter, irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. i think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and i can not help but to mourn the great loss.

i don't know where most of you were at, but where i watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly at the campy plot line, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of brosnan. the only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. i was a dj in the seventies and even went to the abba concert at northlands coliseum in edmonton in sept of 79, so i did appreciate them then and i still do now. but this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. the sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be meryl's worst production. i cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. so save your money, wait for it to come out on dvd and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.

everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut to the chase.forced frivolity. miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun. the brilliant meryl streep gives it a great try. pierce brosnan just plain embarrassing. inexplicably set on a greek island. lots of squealing, shrieking women. lots.it was a silly juke box musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen juke box musical. if you like abba, so-so. if not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. i readily admit that i didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of god. why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight? ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have great night out on the town? that's the feeling of this whole project. it just felt so good when it stopped.

there's no better way to describe the horrendous experience that's to watch mamma mia: hitler must be looking up, saying to the pseudo-director phyllida lloyd 'you monster, what have you done?'everything about the movie is wrong. just wrong! even its success, which is unexplainable. i can understand when those crappy parody movies, like epic movie, make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they're cheap (of course they are!). but when something like mamma mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide, you think 'what the hell is wrong with the world?'and to think we have meryl streep, one of the greatest alive actresses of the world, in it? what was she thinking? 'i need the money', she could say. well then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. it's not that meryl is good in a disastrous piece of, err, 'movie'. she's also disastrous! when she sings, even though she's got the vocals, it's ridiculous. worse than her only pierce brosnan. he used to be james bond. now he's singing abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. really? and when i mention abba, not that i have anything against the band and their music. though it doesn't help them when actors started singing (badly), dancing (worse) and the extras join then (they pop out of nowhere! frequently!) to present one terrible musical sequences after the other. you wanna cry when the music starts. and i love musicals! but this is the first in the genre where you pray for actual silence.i could keep going. the list goes on forever. you could write a stephen king novel with the complete list of mistakes in this movie.to sum up: go watch it! really! you've got to witness to understand!! and since it's already a huge success, who cares if it makes a few more dollars from you? and it's not liking you're selling your soul to the devil. meryl did that before. for the whole mankind. and now the world must end, because we've committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.

relentless like one of those loud action movies. the entire cast seems to be on speed. i didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. i wonder if she's ever seen a stanley donen, vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical. structure, please! this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba. the costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself. no chemistry with her friends (christine baranski and julie walters) think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you'll understand what i was hoping for. i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth. the audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.

this is a new approach to comedy. it isn't funny.the joke is that this, in and of itself, is supposed to be funny.the story is based on a french short story, located in paris, and the characters have french names. louis aubinard, for example ... played by ... bob hoskins? the movie also stars the equally french jeff goldblum and natasha richardson. the situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those carry-on movies from years back.i believe these are also jokes - to cast these actors who make no attempt to act french in any way, to have them cavort in the manner of broad english dance hall comedy, and to leave the whole bloomin' mystery unexplained to the audience.in the humour department, this is practically the algonquin round table, isn't it?the movie tries to be charming and quirky, and i guess these characteristics are sort of funny. not as funny as duck soup or love and death, perhaps, but funnier than the deer hunter or the battleship potemkin.it is an example of personal filmmaking. it makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience, but stays true to its premise and its internal logic. although all the situations are unbelievable, they are logical within the film's own bizarro world.i generally like this kind of eccentric movie, but i found this one to be paced too slowly, to be dull-witted, tedious, and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit. it just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways, and wastes some wonderful talents along the way. it has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars, who are all otherwise distinguished players. i found it to be the biggest waste of talent since the betsy, and i wish i had never seen goldblum and hoskins in this thing.so, call it an interesting miss, and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill.

this movie is not that good at all.its pretty stupid, pretty annoying, and very poorly done.i really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film.although i didn't hate it as much as them, i still found it to be a pretty bad film.the only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times, and also i feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay.what i mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast, not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival, and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film.instead it isn't but instead what it is now, a crappy film.the acting is atrocious i felt as if i was watching a couple of teens act for like a halloween show or thrill ride or something.the kills are pretty cheap(as is the film itself), and basically everything else is low-class.overall this film really is bad and you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film.3.8 out of 10 stars

i have to say that there is one redeeming speck in regards to this "film". it firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel. now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie. other than that i regret watching this debacle. what shameless abandon the making of this "film" was. what a waste of $100,000 (that's right folks, one hundred thousand dollars). this "film" reminds me of that "adult video awards" show in which of group of "industrial prostitutes" stand up a praise themselves, believing that they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. ironic then how i've watched blue movies with better acting, directing and writing. i also found it funny that the executive producer, justin ament, just had to be in the "movie". he plays deputy jake barker. i'm sure his "acting" career has taken off... ted pfiffer, the writer, has a part. he no doubt was wallowing in the clichéd glory he created. it should be noted that carrie finklea has a lead role in the movie. you might remember her from gus van sant's 'elephant'. though i'm not too sure that she'll want to write this film on her resume. and i'm not sure which is a more depressing point; money was spent to make this film or people are going to watch it. along with 'torque', 'godsend' and 'sky captain and the world of tomorrow', one of the worst films, if not the worst film, of 2004.

whoa!terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did i mention terrible?you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie, but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me.well, someone brought this home for me to watch, and when i looked at it i just wanted to strangle the person, because they used my money.i will certainly be taking it back soon, but i might as well tell you about it while i have it in memory, for i definitely want to forget it.this movie doesn't deserve to even be called horrible.it's beyond horrible.quite possibly, the worst film ever.the acting was so, so, so, so horrifically disgusting, as well as the deaths being so entirely lame and predictable.i didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was, which kind of frightens me a little.don't see this film, shame on you if you're even looking at this movie page, and i have extreme pity for you if you're looking at this movie page, because you think this will be decent.final word: yuck!!!!!!!!!!

i usually like hongkong - martial arts - fantasy movies but i hated this one. once upon a time in china, shogun assassin, a chinese ghost story and even big trouble in little china are my favorites but this film sucked! too much fancy tricks and stupid story.4/10

i love most jet li movies (with the exception of romeo must die) and i bought this movie in a very cheap three-pack with "the master" and "twin warriors". while twin warriors was very impressive and i was thoroughly intrigued by it, and the master was a bit "karate kid" but also enjoyable, i thought this movie was terrible. i'm not just saying that because i'm used to better movies. i'm saying that it was almost down there with "kazaam". the fight scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung-fu plot". if you are going to have a plot this stupid (see 'man turns into woman to become all-powerful then falls in love with jet li') you best have some great fighting to go with it. if you are looking for an original hk jet li movie, i suggest you go rent "shaolin temple 2" (aka kids from shaolin).

like in so many movies of the past, you would think hollywood would learn this by now, makes for a very disappointing movie, not to mention, make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransom.maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us. why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost? just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the end.i had to listen to part of the director's comments in the special features section, from the great moves that redford has made in the past, (sneakers for one) surprised he agreed to star in such a film. the director's comments and reasons were weak.the best parts of this movie was the scenery, can't wait for spring to come.

i had never heard of "the clearing" until i was really bored one day with some friends in the local blockbuster and it grabbed our attention. the description on the dvd jacket grabbed our interest, but once we popped it into the dvd player, the boredom was only beginning.the story was dragged out for waaaay too long. it seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping. the most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie, however. after that, the outline was followed exactly and that made "the clearing" unoriginal. the flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the victim's family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film. and i also found that i did not like the ending, so that probably led to me not liking the movie at all.the acting was not horrible...it wasn't the greatest, though. robert redford has given much better performances. willem dafoe's tragic character was the only one i really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie. helen mirren's portrayal as robert redford's wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heart-splitting event.in my opinion, "the clearing" is nothing to rave about. use your movie rental money on something else...like "garden state," perhaps?

i'm sorry but i don't understand how the studio get's away with this. the movie is just not worth it. maybe as a theater-play but certainly not as a movie! and why do they call it a thriller??? offcource the acting is good but i did'n't expect anything less from these perfect actors. robert redford plays very well and willem dafoe is convincing enough as the softy "bad guy". helen mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me ;). i'm also a fan of her british detectives. still they just can't save this ow so boring movie, i'm sorry. i hope we don't get to many movies anymore from this director "pieter jan brugge" cause he obviously doesn't now the meaning of the words "suspence and thriller".

what an atomic bomb of a movie. the story goes nowhere and comes fron nowhere. it leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying "is this it". what happened to redford. he was once a fair actor. now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a take. wrong. what an unemotional film. i don't mean to be so so cruel, but what crap of a movie. unbelievable amateur crap. if i was in this movie i would be so embarased that i would not show my face. i tell you what, if i was associated with this movie, i am in big trouble. this movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to.

business executive is kidnapped, made to wander miles and miles in a woodland for days and days exchanging dialog with his kidnapper.and we have got to listen to all the nonsense......meanwhile his snotty wife and family are at home with the fbi wondering what to do...... .....at no time does she seem concerned about the fate of her husband except when it comes to the ransom..... a "love story"? give me a break!the plot is ludicrous. and almost every scene is filled with an air of expectation that something significant is going to happen but it never does.the result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more silly when we learn the fate of the kidnapper.this is garbage:2 out of 10.

newly released on dvd in the us; just stay far away from it.i usually give plenty of room for stupidity in horror films; i'll settle for nearly anything remotely suspenseful, supernatural, spooky, or even just a vaguely interesting concept. this one simply stank. i knew there was trouble when sara's "best friend" in college, who had considerable screen time, wasn't even listed in the credits on imdb! i wasn't surprised not recognizing any actors, but that character ("daysha" or "day-glo" or whatever her name was) apparently didn't even exist! i'm so embarrassed that i actually paid a rental fee for this garbage; deeply, deeply ashamed...

i know a couple people who look just like the lead actress in this film (or, at least, like the character she portrays.) they all give me the creeps and i would be the last person to ever lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. she has one mean and ugly-looking expression. if you can conjure up a bit of sympathy for her, let me know.of course, i might have the same expressions of concern and fear if i had an imaginary friend who had been killing off my real friends and acquaintances for the last 15 years.and for our european friends on the imdb, i'm saddened to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the us teach courses on paranormal phenomena, relying on the pathetic defense that it represents "academic freedom" and open inquiry.this film is not worth your while. you will have no sympathy for any of the characters (except for aunt lydia, who gets offed pretty early) and the plot makes no sense.

bad plot, bad acting, bad direction.it had possibilities but just didn't achieve anything.this film looks like someone started with an idea, googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music.others had to stop watching because they were scared 2/3 of the way through - i had to take a break purely because i just didn't care anymore.reminded me of an episode of days of our lives with marginally more suspense.just bad.

the film starts well enough. it is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father. the young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious spectre, who kills the two aggressors while she covers in a downstairs cupboard. then, we catch up with her 15 years later as a drug-addled student researching the supernatural, living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead. she has no real friends, was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which no-one else can see. so yep, life is grand. things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her mum's sister, who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched into her forehead. hmm, i wonder who the police's main suspect will be? this is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing. could she be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature? clue: if you think the former, you've picked up the wrong movie from blockbuster. go back and get the correct one, short-sighted gimp.as i said, i was all ready to fast-forward to the good parts, safe in the knowledge that i wasn't missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense potboiler. but the first ten minutes grabbed me, and i decided to give it a chance. i was quite pleasantly surprised: it certainly wasn't a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which i looked forward to finding the solution to. alas, 45 minutes in, i realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library, doing nothing. we then get a cheap scare, followed by quarter of an hour of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend. things only got worse from there, as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another, followed by an ending so anti-climatic it's like being promised the moon and ending up with a teeny weeny meteorite instead. pathetic.if it was bad all the way through, it would have been far easier to swallow. the fact that it starts at a canter and barely ends with a whimper is not just disappointing, it is heartbreaking. how can something which began so promisingly end up being so formulaic? i don't know, and i don't particularly care. i'll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time: don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay, then 5 minutes finishing the rest. you tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppily as you have here... 3/10

wow, what a bad film. not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible. the plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling. what's that line from a famous critic? "she runs the emotional gamut from a to b." yup. that about sums it up. not even good for camp value! i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this? and gosh, her friend's a ghost? you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.this film (and i use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public. if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative! this gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower. on the bright side--at least it's not a full two hours long.

i know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great, but i have to disagree.sure, it's a good book! it was actually one of my favorites when i was verrry little. but it's just not meant for theaters. maybe for a little half-hour short, but i don't see how they can turn a short kiddie book into a whole feature film.it is a cute movie, but i would only recommend it for really little kids. older kids will have no interest it. adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones. but anyone ages 7-adult will have a snore-fest.sorry if you disagree with me, but this is my opinion. :)

up until around 1970 lucille ball was one great comedienne. she was such a perfect clown i only wish more people could have seen her with bob hope in "the facts of life" because she could do dry deadpan, too. as well as slapstick..yep, lucille ball was wonderful . . . until "mame."trying to see lucille ball in "mame" is physically impossible because there is so much vaseline on the already filtered lenses that you'd need windex to see lucille ball in some scenes. so even if you see lucille ball in "mame," you can't really see lucille ball in "mame". which is a blessing.that's about the nicest thing i can say about "mame," the movie of the musical of the movie of the play (this could go on, but it started with a perfectly funny book called "auntie mame"). giving this a bad rap is like beating a sponge. so it does not matter that the music is croaked rather than sung. most of the songs weren't much, anyway. there isn't any difference in the first three. "it's today," "open a new window," and "we need a little christmas" are all the same song. celene dion should do an album with them, they're so big and dull. the killer ballad "if he walked into my life today" needs a confident gorgeous voice (edyie gorme won a grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor lucille ball did not possess when she made this movie. (true, elaine stritch can't carry a tune in a bucket, either, but at least stritch can put over a song.)if you still feel your life is not going to be complete unless you see the movie musical "mame," notice how there is dancing in it, but whenever lucy/mame starts to do anything beyond a palsied shuffle the camera cuts away, returning right when the number is over and the star poses with the dancers. again, it's just as well. jane connell got to reprise the role of pathetic agnes gooch after lucille ball had madeline kahn fired to ensure no comic originality would upstage the star. connell is a stage performer who, like carol channing and ethyl merman, can't scale down her performances for films, so she joins lucille ball in being embarrassing, though for different reasons.the lavish gowns are by theadora van runkle (van wrinkle?) and they provide the color missing in all but one of the cast. bea arthur as the actress vera charles, mame's best friend, ignores everyone and does her own fun thing. if only she was in more scenes. she's too old for her role, too, but at least she didn't maim it.

lucille ball's version of "mame" in my opinion is one of the worst performances ever saved to film. after seeing lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times, i can tell you that i really love lucy, however, this movie is a fiasco of unbelievably bad casting, music and dancing. robert preston is the only saving grace with a part tiny enough to miss if you blink. i don't know what she was thinking, and i can't imagine how she was advised by the studio or director, but i actually cringed watching this embarrassing performance. i could be really cruel and suggest watching it for a laugh, but it's too pitiful even to qualify for that. don't waste your money or your time.

"mame" is a disgrace to many things--to lucille ball, to a story which has been told better many times over, and to the musical genre altogether. ms. ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be heavily sedated. bea arthur is good, but it is not enough. the production is very shoddy and cheap looking, the songs are sub-par, and nearly every joke misfires. also, lucy couldn't dance well, so the music had to be slowed down to a funerial pace. avoid at all costs, but do see the delightful "auntie mame."

this movie could have been a lot better than it was, if hadn't been a disney film. i thought that the young girl playing shirley was all right, you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right. the teenage shirley temple wasn't right at all. i think that they should have spent last time on her childhood, the first hour should have been about the young shirley, then the last hour should have been about the older shirley. this was a boring movie, and not a good shirley temple story.

this movie was awful! ashley rose orr, while a talented tap dancer, and singer (actually a little better than temple was in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. she plays the character as the shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her onscreen or offscreen persona. so what we get is an overly cutesy, and wholly unrealistic (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. if one wants to see that side of her, one can just rent one of her movies. the only bright light here is connie britton's portrayal of gertrude temple. i don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well acted. save yourself the trouble and rent the poor little rich girl.

i didn't think this movie was very good at all. basically they took a bunch of one-liners from various shirley temple movies, threw them together, and had orr act like shirley temple acted on-screen. "oh my goodness!" was said quite a number of times. if you are familiar with shirley temple movies, you will recognize several lines direct from her movies. the trouble is they have orr saying these in shirley's everyday life. in the end, what we get is a hodgepodge of re-created shirley temple movies, instead of any sort of real look into shirley temple's life. save yourself the trouble and rent shirley temple movies, it's a lot better than watching orr try and recreate shirley's acting style.

did we all see the same movie??? i can't believe the raves some of the others are giving this really awful bio which, believe or not, was authorized by shirley temple herself, based on her book child star. gives me the feeling that some are awfully easy to please.first of all, ashley rose orr, whatever her modest talents are, in no way, shape or form even resembles shirley temple enough to be cast as her in this sort of straightforward biography of the world's most famous child star. she gives no indication of why or how this child was so revered except for trying her hardest to do a shirley impersonation which never clicks on any level. none whatsoever.and that is the major handicap of the whole piece. but as if that isn't bad enough, any drama inherent in shirley's story of her climb to almost overnight stardom has been completely white-washed with insipid writing peppered with occasional song and dance moments that don't even approximate what shirley did (as for example, "the codfish ball" with buddy ebsen which was probably the high point of shirley's choreographed dance routines).simply putting a girl in a polka dot dress doesn't make her shirley temple. none of shirley's own brand of charm, warmth and appeal is even remotely suggested. all we see on display is a pale imitation of the original proving, once and for all, that there was only one shirley temple.it's worthless to write anything further about this mess. none of the others are more than ordinary in lifeless roles. my advice for shirley's fans is to read her book--or better still--watch her movies.this is the pits.

i am a huge shirley temple fan. when i saw this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented child shirley actually was. ashley rose orr made possibly the worst on-screen shirley. imagine an 11 year old playing shirley temple from the age of 5. that in itself is wrong. but getting her to 'mimick' shirley's voice? and her singing is woeful. the dancing was good, i'll say that. as previous users have said, there was little dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. not even amelia earhart... i would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that shirley temple created. there was too much focus on the wizard of oz, when in reality, shirley was just considered for dorothy. the film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role. shirley herself said that she is glad judy garland got to play her. for me the star of the show was the lady who played gertrude temple. otherwise, stay away! for great shirley temple films, watch heidi, poor little rich girl and little miss broadway.

this was an appallingly bad film! ashley rose orr was horrible, she had none of shirley temple's charm at all! those ghastly smiles she would do when she scrunched up her piggy little eyes in a way that i think was 'supposed' to be cute and make the audience go - "aahhhh bless!" it just made me want to slap her. she must have simpered "oh my goodneth!" about a hundred times throughout the film. also she could barely utter a sentence without accompanying it with a fake giggle. horrible horrible film .. if i could rate it minus 10, i would. don't waste your money on this piece of rubbish, go out and buy a genuine shirley temple film!

i actually saw this movie at a cinema. at the time, i was working shifts and went there during a matinée on a hot summer day when i couldn't sleep. the cinema was air-conditioned.it was an early multi-screen complex and i somehow got into the wrong venue. i had intended to doze through something else. but as things transpired, there would be no sleeping. shortly after the wrong movie began, i was additionally disconcerted by a group of female cleaners who came in and used it as their social club. i was the only other person there, and it is a measure of the movie's appeal that they habitually expected the place to be empty and asked me if i minded their presence. i didn't.within about half an hour, the cleaners' conversation proved to be more interesting than the entertainment i had paid for.this movie oozed out of the screen with the cheesiness of very stale mayonnaise. the kind that has little dark, hairy, tufts growing on the surface. i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning. the cleaners provided an anticipatory cue by putting their fingers in their ears.it was about some city bird going to live in the sticks amongst a load a backwood folk, putting them straight but at the same time being taught a moral lesson or two herself. like you do. a sort of 'journey of discovery'. there was a sententious smugness about the whole production. in particular, the leading actress had an irritating habit of staring at every hick with a kind of intense beatific compassion, as if she herself were the patron-saint of thickies.and i believe at some stage she wrote a book.long before the end, i had become fascinated by one of the cleaner's hushed and breathy tails of sexual impropriety.one suspects that there are some to whom sitting quietly for a couple of hours and not having to think, constitutes a meditation. the best that i can say is that i would not want to share their salad.i have never seen this movie advertised as showing on television, which surprises me. it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.if you ever work shifts, be sure to get into the right theatre. or hope for some cleaning ladies.

some of the early talkies survived to become classics. 1929's "the squall" is a classic all right, but not in the way it was intended. melodramatic in story and acting, today it seems ludicrous, particularly the casting of myrna loy as nubi, a seductive gypsy. imagine nora charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal. outrageous! however, as many people know, when loy first came to hollywood, she did quite a few of these exotic seductress roles.based on a play, "the squall" concerns the aforementioned gypsy who in the film is now in hungary (spain in the play) running away from her cruel master and inviting herself into the home of the lajos family (richard tucker and alice joyce), basically by appearing at the door. one by one, nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm talking her pidgin english ("nubi not bad! nubi do nothing wrong!") and dropping hints about nice presents. the son in the family, paul (carroll nye) is engaged to the beautiful irma (loretta young) and can't wait to marry her. he loses interest when he meets nubi.with the exception of the lovely alice joyce, zasu pitts as a woman who lives in the household and the stunningly beautiful loretta young, the acting is uniformly awful. loy is stuck with the hallmarks of her character - bad english, whining and hysteria. with her darkened makeup, peasant getup and curly hair, she is not only beautiful but right out of the 1980s - quite modern, though richard tucker's putting the back of his hand on his forehead reminds us we're just emerging from the silents.robert osborne on tcm commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures. while it is deliciously bad, it's not deliciously bad enough to sit through again. it's just bad - but a great example of how far we've come and, had someone not picked up on myrna loy's sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career might have been.

no one is going to mistake the squall for a good movie, but it sure is a memorable one. once you've taken in myrna loy's performance as nubi the hot-blooded gypsy girl you're not likely to forget the experience. when this film was made the exotically beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign vixens, often asian and usually sinister. she's certainly an eyeful here. it appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled. in most scenes she's barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loose-fitting peasant blouse, while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel. i suppose i'm focusing on miss loy's appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching. you sure won't be attracted by the dialogue, which is hopeless. in one typical passage, nubi gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic: "always the gypsies, they sing. weird and sad. when the big sun have breath of fire that burn, and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death, they sing." poetic, or what? lovers of purple prose will have a field day. i can't help but wonder, though, if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this project.like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success. the stage version opened at the 48th street theatre in november of 1926 and ran for over a year. the play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic robert benchley, who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin english. according to a much-repeated anecdote mr. benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show. the spanish village setting (moved to a village in hungary for the movie, for some reason) gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but benchley's patience reached its limit when, during a family dinner sequence, a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting "help! help! he keel me!" she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed "me nubi! me good girl! me stay here!" at that point mr. benchley rose and announced to his companion: "me bobby. me bad boy. me go now," and left the theater.the film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to benchley's level of wit. the melodramatic plot concerns the lajos family: father josef, mother maria, and son paul, a student at the nearby college. we would consider this prosperous family "upper-middle class" as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by, yes, nubi the nubile gypsy girl. she arrives at their door during the storm of the title-- symbolizing stormy emotions, i daresay. the girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for sanctuary. after considering the matter the lajos family agrees to hide her from her angry lover, who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away. nubi becomes a servant in the household. kindness motivates the family's decision to take her in, but soon enough that conniving little good-for-nothing nubi has paid them back by seducing every able-bodied male in the vicinity, starting with the lajos' servant peter, then working her way up to son paul. nubi breaks up paul's relationship with his fiancé irma (played by loretta young, still a teenager), causes him to flunk out of school, and then prompts him to buy her jewelry by stealing the savings of the family's maid lena (zasu pitts). lena, for her part, is still mourning the loss of her own fiancé peter, seduced and tossed aside by nubi when she turned her attentions to paul. ultimately nubi sets her sights on the pater familias josef, and i suppose if the running time had been longer she also would've gone after uncle dani, maria, the village priest and god knows who else.i guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody, but during its first half the squall nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap: we watch, hypnotized, as the bad girl works her spell on the men-folk and wreaks havoc like an irresistible force of nature (almost like-- a storm! ah-haa, another metaphor!). but as the plot machinations grind on the campy fun fades. during the later scenes nubi is de-emphasized and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the lajos family, and after awhile these people get to be a real drag. the son in particular behaves like an absolute heel, yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings; everything, we're told, is the fault of nubi, that no-good tramp.the men of the cast are dull. aside from miss loy the only actress who can handle performing in talkies is zasu pitts, terrific as usual. the mother of the lajos household is played by alice joyce, a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles, and who retired soon after this. loretta young's fresh prettiness provides a nice contrast to nubi's dusky allure, but her line readings are so awkward it's kind of endearing. no, there's only one reason to watch this flick, and that's nubi herself. i can't think of another actress who could've played this silly role and managed to come off half as well. i'm not an objective observer, however. i have a desperate crush on myrna loy and will watch her in anything, even the squall.

this is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows, a certain dixie boy johnson. whether this person ever really existed i don't know, but considering the cast lists a certain "lee lasses white" and roscoe karns playing said character as well, i assume the man did exist and that this is a white-washed (pardon the pun) version of his career. the plot, such as it is, follows dixie boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth, his abandonment of the child to friends, and his return at his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation. another forgotten man, benny fields, plays dixie boy. the man has a lovely baritone voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on screen. gladys george valiantly tries her best to enliven the works to no avail. judy clark does the best impersonation of betty hutton i've ever seen although i believe she thought she was being herself. the scoring replete with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved oscar nom. worth a look.

this movie starts with interesting set design and a promising premise, but fails to provide the cult-movie goods. set in a gritty parallel universe where everything is owned by the "blump" corporation, it concerns a horrible stand-up comic who finds success when he grows a third arm out of his back.all the potential for great cheese is here -- washed-up 80's star judd nelson, wayne newton, offbeat visuals and strange plot digressions, obese women in skimpy lingerie, necrophilia -- but it never pays off.the pacing is the main problem. each scene is excrutiatingly slow. nelson's stand-up routines are supposed to be funny because they're pathetically not funny. but each performance drags on until it's not even tangentially funny, just boring.imagine someone telling you the longest, weirdest joke imaginable, full of smirky self-congratulation for how funny and weird he thinks it is. imagine after a stultifying two hours of this, you never got a punch line. you've just saved yourself the trouble of watching the dark backward.

i have had this movie, in the back of my head sense i saw it. i have wanted to tell people about it time and again, but never remembered. now i found it. now finally, i can tell people precisely what the absolute worst, most crappy movie i have ever seen in my entire life, bar none is.this movie is complete trash, and is unfit for a garbage dump. all prints and other copy's of this movie should be rounded up loaded into a large rocket, and launched into the sun. only the purifying heat and pressure of the sun might be able to purify the materials this movie is stored on, so that they can be useful to the universe again.i like movies. i like bad movies. and yes this is an opinion. but this movie was pure trash, filth, and excrement of some beast that should never be seen let alone named by man.i would rather watch a uwe boll movie marathon than watch this movie. and i hate uwe boll's films.

. . . and never, ever see it. now, i've been watching bad scifi movies for years. i love watching bad scifi movies. i think that was the only reason i could watch this movie the whole way through. i was toughened up by "nukie," "indian superman," and that awful "fantastic four" movie, just to name some examples. usually, i have to beat my head against the wall after i've seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away. no, not with this one. with "tdb," i had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. temporary fix. i can't believe i wanted to see that. i cried. when it finished, i cried. it was horrible. it was worse than when i saw *shudders* wil wheaton in his underwear in "the curse," which, by the way, never watch either. aside from the fact that wesley crusher's in his tighty whiteys, it's just sooo bad. but this review is about "tdb." the worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said, "this deserves to go on film! it's great!" and wayne newton, rob lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "oh, this is what i want on my film history!" i'll watch "indian superman" until the cows come home, but i am never going to see this steaming pile of dren again.

this movie has no heart and no soul; it's an attempt to whomp up a cult film out of the leavings of other, better, directors, principally david lynch and tim burton. rifkin seems to think that if he overloads on a kind of rotted visual style and fills the street with crud and garbage, he's making a statement. but it's not a statement about anything -- except the director's shrill shriek of "hey look at me! i'm an artist, too." but he doesn't have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for things that worked -- such as some of the actors trapped in this -- for other directors. all of this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a turgid, boring chore to sit through.

a friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen. i was curious, because it had developed a bit of a cult status. i like a lot of odd indie cult movies so i gave it a shot. i have to agree with my friend. it is a steaming pile of dung. i am sorry to the people who love this movie, but i can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film. try peter jackson's dead alive (aka braindead), cemetery man (aka dellamorte dellamore) , or modern vampires.

what could have been some majorly creepy stuff ends up being an incomprehensible, nutty motion picture that even the filmmakers themselves probably didn't understand. had they shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever, it might have been creepier, but as it stands now, this is a waste of time and brain cells. is anybody else getting sick of the whole "little kid drawing creepy pictures with crayon" thing? could there possibly be a bigger horror cliché? probably not. i know, i know, it's from some different country, and it's far too refined and sophisticated for me to understand, so i shouldn't expect the "plot" to be spoon-fed to me, blah, blah, blah. whatever. i still say the movie blows.

i never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused. especially in french and the neighboring countries (in belgium, where i am located, for example), "baise-moi" was announced as the most shocking and the most thought-provoking social drama you could ever experience. yeah right! it might be a little shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse?), but the weak and pointless plot surely didn't cause me to think much. "baise-moi" is another one of those "blame everything that goes wrong on society"-films and they're generally not very convincing. about 99% of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymph-girls? the two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes. nadine just killed her roommate; manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned train-station, late at night. they decide to travel around france together, leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop. although we're constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to sit through. like the girls are indicating themselves all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they run into (and kill) are very uninteresting. if people want to make porno movies, that's fine by me, but please don't pretend that it's art-house film-making. if you leave out the swearing and the hip camera-work, all there is to see is (not so) arousing pornography. cool soundtrack, though!

another french film with absurdity. baise-moi(f*ck me) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f*ck. one of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend. second one is a hooker who kills her flatmate and sees her boyfriend being shot dead. after those incidents they meet at a tube station(both misses the last train)then the whole thing starts. they find a bound and come very close. they abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive around the country and have lots of sex. thats all about baise-moi really. we can see that they have no mercy for their victims. they even kill a woman for her money. both actresses are real porn stars in france that affects the movie in two different ways. they look so comfortable in sex scenes, nonetheless, they can't make the whole film worth watching as ,to me, the film does not require no further ability of acting than that. it is a version of thelma and louise on a different level. i could recommend you loads of things to do instead of watching baise-moi. so, bother to watch if you wanna see a pointless, kinky film. * out of *****

i'm sick of the "open mind" argument. i'm generally quite open-minded, but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be "enjoyed." you know what, there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this. and just because someone out there isn't doesn't make it less so. there is, after all, a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should eliminate that feeling. otherwise we're no better than senseless living things.back to the film. another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men, which may be why men don't like it. but just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn't make it great. maybe men shouldn't be turned on by what's dominating the movie industry, but is the answer for women to do the same? maybe, if you don't like movies, tv, and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, don't watch them.and if you're a director, don't make them.otherwise, some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this "movie" happen in real life.heck, some people seem to like it so much.

well, how to make a movie as provocative as possible? this cartoonishly straight shocker tries by having two low-life paris women (one prostitute, one recently raped ex-porn actress, no less) lash out and go on a national sex-and-killing spree- of men in particular. very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore "thelma & louise"- but it's done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message... and since we don't get very close to the protagonists, the violence actually feels muted and numbing- and maybe that's a good thing. as a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, i always welcome when the "serious" movie industry dares to contain full-on sex scenes. but the question is: does it work for the movie as a whole? is it any good? here, not very, although we're given a new meaning to the phrase "a shot in the ass"! 3 out of 10 from ozjeppe

while it's true that the movie is somewhat interesting, the execution leaves a lot to be desired (much like blood orgy of the leather girls, i spit on your grave, and born in flames, all superior). i don't think it's not porn, but porn is in the eye of the beholder: if it functions as porn for somebody, who am i to say that he/she is wrong? i was rather puzzled by the statement in winkimation's generally thoughtful review ("such a shame") that "for once we actually see men's faces when they come." a few years ago i did occasional freelance reviews for an adult mag and i recall seeing plenty of men's faces when they came. i think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn "stars" (and especially when that male is the director). though i unsurprisingly can't refer to any specific titles, i know that there are some instances in ron jeremy's, uh, work. i also don't know that i'd agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when coming.

there was no need for this movie, plain and simple. the original, although hated by some, was something i found to be actually really entertaining, mainly because it was before jim carrey started to really lose his touch, and cameron diaz was, well, "smoooooookin!" 'nuff said. so why make a sequel/prequel thing? honestly? knowing that jim carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. but then they just make mistake after mistake. jamie kennedy. why is this man still allowed to breathe? the writing and story: terrible. why would i ever want to see a baby wearing the mask? moreover why would i want to see it fly? ever? how did someone think this was a good idea?! the acting is despicable, in fact nearly everything about this movie is. i'm trying to keep calm, or imdb probably won't let me post this. bottom line: don't watch this piece of trash. pick up the original, see how good cameron diaz looked and how jim carrey used to have a career, and laugh. don't waste even a second of your time on this.

(contains really bad spoilers) so what can i say about this....it's a really horrible and awful movie!!.too much cgi and special effects....you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is!!.please at least go watch "dungeons and dragons" which is another terrible pile of trash.son of the mask makes dungeons and dragons way better!!! uggg!!!!!!!!!!!! pure crap!!!!!!!!!!!!i hate this trash!! i would also like to say that "superbabies:babygeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie.probably just as stupid as "son of the mask"."babygeniuses 2 was just as fake as"son of the mask" and also contains way too much cgi!!anyway yeah...this was a bad bad really bad movie....just please avoid it....do not recommend this to no one...please its just way too ridiculous....makes no sense and really bad plot.the baby peing on his dad was just lame!

ok, about 11 years ago the awesome, funny movie, "the mask", came out and everyone loved it and now, 11 years later the mask is brought back in this awesome movie right? wrong!!!!!!!!!! this movie was the stupidest movie that i have probably ever seen!! i mean when i rented it i thought that i would be laughing so hard that i would almost pee my pants like from the first one. but after i saw this "sequal" i barley even let out a chuckle. i mean no offense to the director or the cast of this movie, but what a waste of time and money. so, the plot of the whole story was about this little baby that has part of the mask in him and this evil person is after him for some thing, because that is all i really got, i would have least added some more things to it so it would be higher than a 2 out of 10 stars.

loki, norse god of mischief, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. at the command of his father, odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. in the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. etc. etc. if this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. you can find worse movies, but you'll have to actively search for them.for the most part, son of the mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre-schooler, but in light of scenes such as the mask-baby urinating copiously in six different directions, including on his father, this premise seems unlikely. i asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie, and he responded "convicted felons," apparently forgetting for the moment that the constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.but just making a bad movie is not a sin, or hell would be overflowing. what makes it a sin is that $72 million was spent on this piece of garbage. to put things in perspective, the day after we watched son of the mask, my son and i watched "good night, and good luck," a movie that garnered six academy award nominations (including best picture), and was brought in for $7 million. that's right. just one-tenth of the amount of money spent on son of the mask. this, then is the sin -- to flush good money down the sewer, when it could have been better used in making watchable movies, or feeding starving children, or for that matter, almost any other purpose. the producers should truly be ashamed of themselves.

spoilersi love movies. i've seen a lot of movies. i didn't think i'd ever see a film that i actually hated. son of the mask ruined it. son of the mask is so bad i'm not even going to do a detailed comment like i usually do. in fact, i'm not even going to write a lot. i think all of you should know that this movie is horribly awful. and poor jamie kennedy. he was awesome in scream, but now this film! also, this film takes a smo-can film and turns it into this goofy kids film that not even kids will like. this film also consists of very rude humor. like the nose woman. she has a nose for a head and when she sneezes white stuff spews out of her nose. there is also an exorcist parody. yes, a kid film has an adult parody. maybe they thought the adults would like it. quite frankly, it made the film even more cheesier and crude.here's the basic, stupid plot. tim avery's dog gets the amazing loki mask and turns into a cartoon dog thing. when tim is paying more attention to the baby with special powers, cartoon dog becomes a wiley coyote ripoff. then loki takes the baby with amazing powers and tim and loki have a really cheesy animated fight. tim's wearing the mask. it all ends happy. too bad this movie is horrible. overall, the original the mask was a fantastic jim carrey movie. this, basically is not. please, please, don't rent, buy, or download this movie. i made a terrible mistake renting this. i don't want you guys to make that same exact mistake. i feel horrible that i couldn't write a detailed comment, but really, what's there to comment on?2/10 i'd give it a one, but come on, it's basically a kid film.recommended films: the mask.

sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim, well in this case it was. i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny, i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it.the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem with their sex lives; dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before, ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object, tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman.the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to "i don't believe that anybody could write that" an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash, then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma. the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i didn't think their acting was all that bad... not that it was all that good either. surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic.i certainly wouldn't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film, i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates.

there are no spoilers for this film as nothing could be written that could make it any worse! the dictionary definition of "puerile" should now read: "sex lives of the potato men"! unless, that is, you like dog poo and mucous; in which case - this is the film to see! johnny vegas et all - what were you thinking!

the daily mail's christopher tookey had some choice things to say about this film, among them "watch it all the way through its 82 miserable minutes, and i guarantee you'll be shaking your head and asking: 'have we really descended to this?' yes, we have, for if ever a movie testified to the utter cynicism, tastelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make british movies, it is this abomination". tookey continues "aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear, filthy minds and knuckles that graze the pavement when they walk, this sex comedy is so sordid, unfunny and malodorous that it is enough to put you off sex, and indeed films, for life", before concluding "sex lives of the potato men is not merely a truly vile film, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen". normally i don't listen too closely to the critics, but in this case, tookey was bang on the money. this film goes beyond bad, indeed, it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of 'hilarious' seems to be 'saying tw*t in a brummie accent'. it's depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the goodies, monty python, spitting image, not the nine o'clock news and fawlty towers.ideally, sex lives of the potato men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire vix spin-off the fat slags (2004) and the ill-starred all saints vehicle honest (2000) in the celluloid graveyard, but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule-filling screenings and misguided "best film ever!" raves from people who should know better, so i must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the british film industry, in all its wisdom, has inflicted onto an undeserving world. yes, i really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead, but i actually remember thinking "it can't be as bad as the critics said it was"...but, as god is my witness, it was worse.acting - dire from start to finish, special mention to mackenzie 'albert steptoe's legs on a young man's body' crook.soundtrack - cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle which brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy cockernee doin' the lambeth walk to a watered-down imitation of the specials knob-shiners madness on every single comedy / variety programme in the eighties...and 'ace of spades' by motorhead as the title music? what the hell...trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by the young ones, indeed, ever offered by any comedy show?! cheap shot, way below the belt.script - written by a 12 year old who's just read every single back issue of smut and zit in one long red bull-fuelled session...surely? c'mon, no real, proper, worldly, grown-up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? and mark gatiss was in it...mark gatiss...the least annoying member of the league of gentlemen and goodies fan taking part in such a towering heap of fly-blown cinematic excrement? 'one of the brightest british comedy stars'? not any more he's not! on the subject of league of gentlemen, somebody give me a pair of lead-lined diver's boots and steve 'face like a collapsed rectum' pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before i die...please...cinema, british or otherwise, just doesn't come much worse than this. kent bateman's the headless eyes (1971) is a new-wave masterpiece compared to this repugnant smut.

i found myself watching sex lives of the potato men with a furrowed brow, puzzled why so many talented and witty comedians decided to be involved in a film so totally devoid of humour.poo and wanking jokes are funny when you're eleven. eighteen plus and you begin to lose friends around the water cooler.maybe some enjoyment could be had from this movie if you're the kind of person who frequently plays practical jokes involving dog mess, brown bags and matches, or maybe partake in 'man' competitions on nights-out by imbibing companions' vomit/urine etc when you're not back at your parent's basement punching your teenage wife.even then "sex lives..." it's hard to recommend. perhaps if you're really weirdly into masochistic cranial surgery and spend your evenings happy slapping the elderly or watching toilets flush, you might think a close-up of a bogie is worthy of cinematic distribution.i'd discuss characterisation, narrative or performances had i not zoned completely out following the lengthy tuna-paste/vagina comparison.

i watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. there is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? it has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a british comedy. it also has johnny vegas and mackenzie crook, marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.what it's principally lacking is charm. the characters are impossibly idiotic, unbelievable and alienating, so that instead of a film of men behaving badly the producers have made game on. any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of dozy, sexist british men would have got hold of a few copies of loaded, zoo or even viz to read sid the sexist and the thing would have written itself. instead, the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic, difficult to care about, characters. character comedy - as opposed to slapstick etc - only works if the audience can recognise some human truth to the situation. but watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you can't stop it.sadly, the film is also poorly made. the plot structure is weak, there's little character delineation or development, and many of the scenes aren't funny. time after time the same lame reggae chips in to divide scenes, pointlessly and gratingly. there's a lot of needless repetition - when you've done one joke about parking outside a sex party you don't need to do it again. one wonders what the uk film council saw in the script.this is a world where most men are rakes, and most women are continually up for it. the apartment and alfie satirised much the same world view, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. thus they've ended up with a kind of inferior update of confessions of a window cleaner. somebody british needs to have another go at this kind of thing, and do it properly  a good next project for simon pegg and edgar wright i think...

ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? this is one of those films. it was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. i caught it on tv last night and gave in to curiosity.in the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'carry on...' vein but with 'adult' language. indeed, it harks back to the 60s/70s uk porn industry, cheating punters by promising real sex and not delivering (spot the nipple?) that whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here but with modern cinematography.it has the benefit of mackenzie crook (the office, pirates of the caribbean and much more) and also johnny vegas. the chip shop girl is genuinely sexy. beyond these unexpected positives, it does leave me wondering what happened to england. junk food, low paid work, council estates, desperate lives. as a bonus, there are some nice shots of leafy birmingham. foreigners might find it informative about british attitudes and aspirations. overall, though, i still feel disbelief that i sat through it.

sex lives of the potato men is about the sex lives of several men involved in delivering potatoes. so there are no surprises there. it is, in fact, pretty much what you might expect from the title: that is, it's a quirky comedy involving sex and potato men. at times the film works. it's an edgy, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather unimportant and rather average men who are having problems of various sorts with women. where the film clearly does not work, and why it failed at the box office, is that the quirky, uncomfortable parts are perhaps just a shade too quirky and uncomfortable. instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling masturbating over another man while he makes love to his wife, i think most of us just kind of groan awkwardly and wonder what andy humphries was thinking. well, perhaps we are shown what he was thinking all too clearly.

the good news for imdb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. i should add here that i'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. but sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.i'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. i can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. the acting was extremely thin. the pace of the movie was agonizing. i gave it new chances at every turn (mostly because i didn't want to feel like i was wasting a saturday morning in ny), but with every new scene, it dragged longer, delivering characters in which i took no interest, with which i could not connect, for whom i could not empathize.when i see negative reviews on imdb of small independent films like this, i sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to grind (something like. . he used to date the gaffer, she dumped him, and now he's going to trash everything she ever works on). but here, nope. i know no one who worked on this film. and i wish it would have been great. but the film wasn't dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . those suggest that i connected with the film . . . nope, henry may long was just too long, empty, and tedious. that's the tomas take on this one.

on the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics, particularly concerned with himmler, the ss and their research branch. it also has some good piano music, some interesting footage and some excellent camera work.however it is a very poor piece of historical work. it has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows.himmler set up a department in the ss for research into the origins of the german race. they went all over the world. they did some things and launched expeditions to all manner of places... (nonoe of these avenues were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). they wanted to establish that the aryan race and the german people were one and the same thing through historical proof. they didn't find any. the members of this research group were leading professors, members of the ss and therefore linked to the holocaust, and were seen as ok after the war and went on to lead german institutes.these facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either condemns these people or exonerates them. nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme, the aim of the program is unclear, it hops from topic to topic. the witnesses, though presented as credible, are few and unsupported.sadly this programme does not know where it is going or why and fails to impress. the topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on. i would avoid this.also the 'holy grail'is the german bloodline, nothing to do with the holy grail of christian mythology except in passing. mentions of expeditions to look for the christian holy grail are made but never followed through. the title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and incomplete.

strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of alan and anya ornsby, this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre, but is still way high on the cheese-factor. includes several bargain-basement zombies, outrageously campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by alan ormsby, several gay/kinky grave-robbers, and one straange soundtrack. wife anya puts on a performance that's so odd, one has to wonder if she's really acting at all. there are much worst pics of this kind during the era (look for any al adamson flic), but it's no night of the living dead. director/writer "benjamin" clark, is really bob clark, who went on to create the purile "porky's" early 80's teen exploitation disasters. he has only now resurfaced after 1 inexplicably good movie ("a christmas story") to return to his dreadful ways with "baby geniuses". weirdo alan ormsby later wrote the kinky nastasia kinski/malcolm mcdowell version of "cat people". moocow says check this hippy horror movie out for fun, zombie frolics, and campy dialogue :=8)

"i haven't laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer," says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all those val lewton and george a. romero walking-dead movies we have come to love (or loath, depending on your personal taste) through the years. in this story, a young actor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after, one spooky night, they visit a cemetery island. their artistic director, alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritual.way too much screen time is misspent; the amateur dialog includes lame witticisms, melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries (and can't alan stop that irritating laughter... way too much!). once the action kicks in (which comes close to the end of this film), it's worth the wait. i saw this one on a late-night, local station television program that ran films very much like this one... only this one scared me at the age of 13... but then again, you might laugh your way through it, until the bitter end... ...which is probably the reason, nowadays, why very few people still wear striped hip-huggers.

it seems like an exciting prospect, a modern-dress "othello" with christopher eccleston, who was so frighteningly good in "shallow grave" and (especially) "jude," and eamonn walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on "oz." one would think them both natural shakespeareans, but both performers misfire: walker's othello is a fairly cookie-cutter take on the part, with a whispery delivery that doesn't make much of an impact; and eccleston hams it up appallingly as iago, winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role. it's likely he was egged on by his director, whose florid approach might have worked better with elizabethan language, but who seems a jarring, pretentious choice for this modernized screenplay. and the screenplay itself is less disappointing in being modern than it is in being obvious  it's as if andrew davies sketched out the famous plot and then just wrote whatever dialogue first popped into his head. all in all, a failure. 4 out of 10.

othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film. the bad depiction of shakespeare's characters, and the terrible rendition of the love that desi & john had, made this movie the horrendous filth that it is. by far, othello, directed by jeffery saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and desi. their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend. in the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between john and desdemona is inseparable beyond belief. moments later, ben jago, john's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is. by far, this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself. with that being said, it does have a miniscule amount of good parts. for example, the love that was shown between john and desi, was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book. although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealously that othello had between cass and desi as well as it should. love, jealously, deceitfulness, this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel. the novel however, really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could. for example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. much more detail is also put into the novel. this is why this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it will find it disappointing as well. in conclusion, this film was by far, the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind. by avoiding to see this film, not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives, but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of ben jago popping out at them.

it's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeare's othello, by bringing it to modern day context. however, the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off. there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective, however, john othello, played by eamonn walker, over reacted a lot in this film, causing for the down fall of keeley hawes, dessie brabant, eventually ending in dessie's death. ben jago, played by christopher eccleston, was seen as the main character in the film. he didn't give enough evidence for dessie to be cheating on othello, with michael cass, played by richard coyle. instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she "was" cheating. in the play, it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything. this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons, than what the book was based off of. however, the movie did have a few good points. it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks, where othello is the main chief of the police squad. these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds, and burning fires. you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie, more so than you can in the book. this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand, than the shakespearian times it was written in. in the play iago (jago) gets tortured at the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction, and gets othello's position. he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late. i saw this as a downfall in the movie, because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying, and in the book, he is found out by rodrigo. overall, the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did. i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow, or make it more of a tragedy. i would say that you should read the book first, in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you may find yourself lost, and confused.

in all the episodes, i never saw any real action or drama or comedy.the plot is so repetitive.****somebody gets something old and then somebody else tells them a little bit about it and how much it's worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell for and if there was any work done to it.sowhile i watched about 30 of these, i realized...there is no drama....nobody ever loses a limb or life or gets divorced or hit by a car or air-plane.there are no car chases or explosions- not even a horse race with old carriages.all those guns and swords and nobody goes on a violent killing spree...what gives? no pshycos, no axe-murders, no-gun-totting old englishmen in bad suits...just yap yap yap...you have an old tea set and it came from the country of germany back in 1602 - blah blah blah...i'm still waiting for somebody with a time machine to go on screen and ask about it, but no...it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy englishman or woman serves up some crap about something old being sold in boston or china during the ming dynasty - big effin deal.can't anybody ever kidnap one of the leads and hold them for ransom? is there no alien spacecraft that will obliterate the entire floor? who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake? this is about as entertaining as watching paint dry - only with commentary.there's no sex, there's no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts.this show sucks! what ever happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spewing lasers from a futuristic weapon? antiques roadshow - more like grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show...

it is very possible that i simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me (something similar happened with triplets of belleville), but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate, an exchange student from japan, immediately started laughing at the movie, saying that it sounded dumb. now, i don't agree that it is dumb, the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled. it's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time.but the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me. it has an interesting message about stinginess and greed, but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning, especially because you already knew it anyway. the sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits, for example, are indeed repulsive.there was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp, but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else. there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it.as i said about triplets of belleville, this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim, or its japanese counterpart, but an academy award nominated film? it gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from.

i love japanese movies--having seen at least 100-200. so it's obvious i am not afraid of japanese films. however, sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to westerners. they might be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well,...normal. it's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd ps2 games such as dating simulators or katamari damacy--things that are accepted there that confuse non-japanese. this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted, such as american football, fried snicker bars and paris hilton! well the king of strange japanese films that just don't seem right to americans might just be atama-yama. now the style of animation isn't the issue--it's different but nice enough. no, it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending. that's what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this: there was a stingy man who, for no apparent reason, had a tree growing out of his head. it was little at first and he simply cut it away, but again and again it grew back--so he just decided to let it go. and, after a while, people began living on his head under the shade of the tree. oddly, while they were under the tree, they were tiny but when they left, they were full sized again. then, after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree, the man drown himself(!?) in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was! the end.see! i told you this was very, very odd--but not in a good way like tampopo or happiness of the katakuris--just odd. o-d-d....odd! and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing, i doubt if you'll feel bad to know that this oscar-nominated film did not win. frankly, that makes me happy, as i really don't want this film to spur on such similar films. the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice, but not spectacular animation.this film made my brain hurt....i hope that isn't a sign that i have a tree!

this is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. robert taylor has been primed by corporate head burl ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. he sends him to england to negotiate a deal, where taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. he comes back emtpy handed, having done his duty but having told the truth to the english about his motives. he attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. it could have been gritter, nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics.somehow the costume design was nominated (undeservedly) for an oscar - it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work yet again, no doubt.what is stiking however is the black and white cinemascope cinematography which is excellent - this if anything deserved the oscar nom. (it was mgm's first 'scope film in b&w).not as good as it could have been but not terrible either.

i know it sounds crazy but yes, i am a huge fan of house party 1 and 2 (and proud of it!!). i hated part 3, and then here comes part 4. i was like are you kidding me with this? kid 'n play are nowhere to be found in this movie, and that would've been okay, had they not foolishly entitled the movie house party 4, as if it was in any way, shape, form, or fashion related to its predecessors. every time this movie comes on late at night on usa, i shoot my tv with a rifle. quite frankly, it really is just that atrocious. *hurling*as the only remaining fan of kid 'n play that will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee), i was appalled. remember that stupid little boy group immature? they snuck their way into house party 3. okay, fine and well but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they're not even the same kids from part 3. *confused!!!!* house party fans: do yourself a favor and stick to house party 1 and 2 and class act. beyond that, everything else is ridiculous.

sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch, but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind. house party 4: down to the last minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off. this final installment to the house party series is by far the worst, not just sequel, but film released by hollywood. it becomes very apparent early on in this "feature" that director chris stokes loved ferris bueller's day off with a passion. i say this because it becomes very clear that stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of bueller off john hughes' hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor. you would think that by "stealing" themes and images from a funnier film, your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two. with house party 4, stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, much less a hollywood film. from his confusing and choppy story, the inability to make sense of his characters, and recycled old/tired cliché moments, all stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the house party films. it reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum, and straws and presents it as "hannibal crossing the alps". it just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.so, where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? honestly, i do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long, so instead i would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest. to begin, i still cannot shake the ferris beuller rip-off. it was as if director stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to house party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula. that was a huge mistake. when a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. we think that we are going in one direction, but instead we head in another one. that is exactly what you can witness in house party 4. in one instance we have john-john trying to have the "biggest party of the decade" while also trying to score a record deal (ok, kinda reminds me of the original house party), but then we whisk away to this random island where uncle charles is afraid of flying, grandma gets drunk, and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer. again, we begin somewhat strong, and end chaotic. this is the confusion in which i speak. director stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. he would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series. one would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another house party film he would walk into it thinking that he/she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life, instead stokes just wanted to get paid.i realize that i am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by, but i do believe i still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture. i listened to rap and r&b growing up, but the group "immature" never made it to either my cassette deck or my cd player. why? i don't think they ever quite had a following, but apparently to director chris stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new house party film. didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly? or how about the option to have stokes himself play the comedic car repairman, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor. it was one of those few instances when i actually missed robin harris, and i never thought i would find myself saying that to any film. outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role, i also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film. uncle charles was annoying when he attempted humor. kim whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while  well  everyone else pretty much falls into that category.where did chris stokes spend most of the budget for this film? not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some, there were definitely none present at the "unforgettable" house party, nor the possible dream that perhaps kid or play would make one final appearance. house party 4 followed no preset design, which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down. can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the "escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver" routine for humor? stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance. for once i can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film. house party 4 buried the series, and while i do hear that there may be more in the pipeline, i only hope hollywood realizes that this series has died. hollywood needs to let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future. i think a sequel to who's the man? would get them started in the right direction.grade: * out of *****

a long time ago, way back in the early '80s, a late-night tv show "fridays" came to abc, trying to steal the limelight away from nbc's badly-listing "saturday night live". it didn't but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented "comedians" to the world. like mark blankenfield, for example.which, in a roundabout way, brings us to "jekyll and hyde... together again". which is repugnant in ways all its own.blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after communion. and about as tasteful, too. this is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated "fridays" show stretched out to feature length. and if you didn't like him there, why are you reading this review?any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, that's a bad sign. then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out, things can only get worse.a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story? about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of poe's "fall of the house of usher".aside from a few (very few) gags that give a slight grin, this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities.no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave. what more observant a review could they give themselves?no stars. no, not even for armstrong, who should have known better. "hyde" from this one.

honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, i could take it or leave it. the problem i have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love-fest for the murderer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. the execution of wanda jean, with it's completely one sided view, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. it tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported that view. she seemed uneducated, but so did her entire family, but that doesn't mean they were all retarded. i can completely understand if someone is opposed to the death penalty, but to completely ignore the crime, as if it didn't happen, and try to put wanda on some moral mountain top, is offensive in nature, and that's not the side of the issue i would be associated with.

deep sea 3d is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand.from the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily engulfing us in the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the imax format. a jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre, a shark powers towards us, predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey. it is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes.our ears on the other hand, are not given the same treatment. the film is narrated by hollywood stars jonny depp and kate winslet. both sound so ridiculous it positively spoils the enjoyment of the visuals. depp sounds slightly bored whilst winslet sounds as if she is reading a bedtime story to the village idiot. i was shocked that an actress of her status could have pitched her performance so wrongly. the script is fairly silly and contains very little depth. the soundtrack is filled with strange, unrealistic sound effects which i assume are meant to be funny but in fact detract attention from the material which should have been allowed to speak for itself. danny elfman has provided an excellent score which gives plenty of impact to the ups and downs of life under the sea, when it is allowed to play out without the silly bubble sounds or crayfish footfalls which pepper film.the film is a technical marvel but with it's childish script, annoying narration and misplaced sound effects it cannot be taken seriously.

although this was the first hunter s. thompson documentary i have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as johnny depp, bill murray, gary busey, and a few others. i was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. what kept me watching was some of the old clips from fear and loathing in las vegas and where the buffalo roam. not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. i still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half. still if your a fan i would you'll like anything that has to do with hunter. best regards

i did not quite get barnens o  it is one of the weirdest ones i have watched. the soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by jean michel jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me, or boring  or confusing. there are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up . probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be "when you are alone, you can control things " and "i will show them "- or something like that .the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  "the last summer as a child "he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max. so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you won't miss much if you don't.

i didn't really care for this. had they gotten rid of the comedy/slapstick and focused on the dramatic/philosophical aspects of the script, this might have been worthwhile.the more the film went on, the less i liked the protagonist/mailman. he does have interesting things to say, but he's also a hypocritical, insecure jerk.3/10

i don't know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say, but they badly failed at whatever it was. unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer. i watched this movie simply because drew barrymore was in it, and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it. the whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is utterly ridiculous.

i'm not going to say too much as this movie isn't worth the effort. to put it simply the movie absolutely sucked! this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the storyline was stupid, you couldn't follow what was happening, the characters were so annoying especially the main guy. i wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of it's misery.very, very bad.

some movies are off-beat, but enjoyable, but many movies are just mind-numbingly weird. "motorama" fits not-so-nicely in the latter category. many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense, but those two things can only take a movie so far, and "motorama" simply doesn't have any other merits to its credit."motorama" delights itself on plot improbabilities. its main character, gus, is a cussing 10-year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win $500 million. when interacting with adult figures, none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that he's 10 years old. at first it's incredibly funny, but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable, especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing (to someone that age) imagery going on around him. gus has no depth, and, as an anti-hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces, it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble.that trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances, each mistreating gus in more and more strange ways. besides making the already worn-out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable, the characters share gus' lack of depth and are equally unmemorable. the character's actions can get a little interesting, but the actors themselves don't add anything to them, thus negating the whole point of getting big names (they could've been played by anyone and the character would've been the same). these guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything else."motorama" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but there's too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work. incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer don't, as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident, in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for gus. that never happens, as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect, it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt, one incident after another. with a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable, and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level, "motorama" has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich. why should we care about that?

this oddity contains bunuel-like touches, but doesn't sustain one's interest. a 10 year old roams a bizarro america in a stolen mustang, while the usual cult movie suspects (dick miller, mary woronov, susie tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. like his after hours and vampire's kiss, the screenwriter delights in making you squirm. i remained unaffected, due to the broad acting. you know you're in for it when meat loaf and flea give the most appealing perfs. (and what did this kid's screen test look like? he's insufferable.) recommended to the dozen or so fans of sonny boy ('87).

a 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across america to find motorama cards, which is a gas station card game, that if he can find to spell out "motorama" he has a chance to win 500 million dollars. he meets many bizarre characters along the way. no one can make an 'instant cult classic', joe minion's previous "after hours" achieved that by sheer merit & an amazing director, but it wasn't instant. this movie, on the other hand, is just bizarre just to be bizarre. no rhyme or reason to any of it. the plot is incidental at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos. it's just not a fun film nor a thoughtful one. it's way too slapped together. i've heard many comparisons between this and david lynch films. that's damn near heresy as even lynch's 'worst' film (worst in quotes, as he doesn't have an bad films really) is still miles above this dreck. eye candy: cynthia king is topless very briefly dvd extras: trailer for "joe dirt'

sigh. i'm baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak tim burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. and we got the "joke" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright?but i guess what's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called lenore, the cute little dead girl by roman dirge! as any quick internet search will reveal. i mean, what is this? this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker? "give your head a shake" as don cherry might say.

you may like tim burton's fantasies, but not in a commercial-like show off lasting 8 minutes. it demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace.

the movie uses motifs that could be plagiarized from "wait until dark" (1967), a much better movie by terence young, starring audrey hepburn. "dead silent" is a pale paraphrase. there is nothing new here -- the hidden object in the doll, the bad men wanting it, the bad guy posing as a good guy. the disability, though, has shifted : audrey hepburn couldn't see, the child in ds cannot speak. but both stories hinge on the handicap. where "wait until dark" built up unbearable suspense, "dead silent" lets you guess the outcome, the story being such a stereotype.

whoever likened this one to raiders of the lost ark certainly knew whereof he spoke. he might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. "kay hoog" reminds one more than a little of both lamont cranston (the shadow) and clark savage (doc savage). (the shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first "dark knight"- was also thought to be one kent allard. if one were to take savage's first name first and add to it the kent, you end up with- voila- clark kent. funny, innit?) like indiana jones, hoog isn't above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more blatant and less "charmingly roguish" than jones's). unfortunately, this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials (from any era) in terms of overall quality. one of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback, quite literally breathing down his neck, simply watch as hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon. why they don't bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films.the second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. granted, this was one of the first ever serials and, as such, should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits, even, to tolerance. (at one point, the capture of the hero is effected not on screen, but in the narration itself! talk about cutting corners...) fritz lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, the spiders is a bitter pill indeed to swallow...

well, well... even if you're a fervent admirer of lang's silent films, this early one - the first part of a two-part unfinished four-part serial(!) - will leave you in doubt about fritz's narrative skills. (his directorial skills aren't that evident either, but here and there one senses his talent for building up atmosphere.) the pic's just pure juvenile nonsense, which wouldn't be half as bad, were it not for the long ponderous stretches in between the childish action scenes.but the whole affair almost gets by on its amiable innocence.4 out of 10 inca treasures

this is strictly for pryor fans. just because he was a great, funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a b-movie. the script is awful, it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. it balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither. first there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic, uninspired vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... how more can you pander to your audience?... that prison time is boring, unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep. back in the u.s. the guy for no real reason at all is considered a "war hero". yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps. or are they really? we will soon find out. yawn. there are annoying clichés: his sick mother, his little daughter he never meets, a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc. it is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant. doesn't work at all. overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war. just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian, played in a few good movies and died of ms is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly, unconvincing, unfunny comedy. but if you like richard pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of dadaist poetry.

the story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other. they proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift, it was almost like, 'i hope she likes it'! there is a killing in the film and catherine mary stewart,(julia kerbridge),"reaper",2000, gets involved with the case because of family ties. julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life. rob lowe, (kevin finney),"view from the top",03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. this is not a bad film, but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about, unless you like a film location in canada and a good looking catherine mary stewart, a native from canada.

i was reading in a stuff magazine about some of the goriest, bloodiest films that asia had to offer and i immediately jumped to netflix to quench my thirst. boy what a mistake i made. this movie is one of the worst films i have seen. first and foremost no plot, what i expected to be the plot (see: "revenge") turned into a series of events just happening in a effort to spend their special effects budget of $14.89 and waste studio time. they should have kept their money and not wasted their time nor yours.when a major plot twist occurs, tetsuo ii: body hammer is given a new identity and i wasn't buying it. a flashback is given that should answer our questions, but seemed to me like i turned on showtime at 3:47 am and dropped acid. the movie continues and spirals out of control with cheesy graphics and special (olympic) effects.do i seem bitter about this film? yes. did i see iron man? no. was there a plot? no. was it so symbolic that i didn't understand? no. was there a body hammer? beats the hell out of me. so take my advice and stay away!!!!!! (i must admit though i have had so much fun writing this and laughing to myself about this film that if you want to laugh, watch it!!!)

"julia kerbridge (catherine mary stewart) is working hard to become a doctor. suddenly, julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece, amanda, after her parents are found murdered. julia has a new neighbor, the mysterious kevin finney (rob lowe). her hectic life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young amanda holds the key to a terrible secret. for she too is now the target of the killers. julia must discover whether kevin is friend or foe, and unlock the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again," according to the dvd sleeve synopsis.this thriller quietly falls apart at the seams, but it is interesting some of the time. stalker sean devine's background telephone scene (outside the police station) and mr. lowe's violin (restaurant) are tensely played. but, early on, it's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene. unfortunately, this is not an intricate plot point; and, there are worse story stumbles afoot. overall "dead silent" is not a bad way to spend some time, if there is nothing better on, or you're into lowe and his co-stars.**** dead silent (1999) roger cardinal ~ catherine mary stewart, rob lowe, arlen aguayo-stewart, larry day

rob lowe must have eaten up the entire budget, but i can't fault him for running with the money. even he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. filming, editing, direction, dialogue, sets, makeup, writing, casting (especially the young girl and imposter child psychiatrist), and the story all were just the worst. i have never seen such a horrible movie. pass this one up for any other rental selection, or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the tv. dead silent should be silenced for all time.

the first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up, to predictable and the worst scenario i've seen. won't and hopefully i din't buy it. also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did, suck even more. all i want to say to the people who make this is: don't do whole episode about space, because they suck. the point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before. gets worse from season to season. i got so disappointed and frustrated watching first 4 episodes of season 6 that i just had to write this. only people who are brain washed can watch this crap. seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time. think that my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do.

i loved the first "american graffiti" with all my heart and soul that i considered it to be the best movie about rock n' roll along with being the best teenager flick i've ever seen. the first film spawned the careers of george lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic "star wars" before doing the prequels two decades later while making richard dreyfuss a star in jaws, close encounters of the third kind and other films as well.somehow without those two, the magic died off."more american graffiti" shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where steve (ron howard) and laurie (cindy williams) are protesting against the vietnam war while their friend terry "the toad" fields (charles martin smith) is in the war himself and trying to get out. john milner (paul le mat) is still the hot drag racer in california where he never quite left home. the rest of the supporting actors in the film from candy clark's debbie (terry's girlfriend), to the pharaoh's gang members, along with harrison ford and others really don't do much. the original film showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock n' roll from buddy holly, the fleetwoods, chuck berry, fats domino, bill haley and the comets, buddy knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music. the soundtrack for "more american graffiti" is a mixture of rock, soul, country, hippie music, and whatever fitted the mood during the late 60's of protesting, drugs, sacrifices and more.after watching "more american graffiti" it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first film (with the exception of dreyfuss's character) where it wasn't necessary. this film wasn't necessary either as i was glad to see that neither lucas or dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects.

the gang is back for more! ron howard and cindy williams are now married! her brother is demonstrating against the draft and charles martin smith is doing everything he can in vietnam to get sent home.the issues of the 60's are brought to light here, but it's all over the place, beginning with new year's eve 1963, then three minutes later, it's new year's eve 1964, then three minutes later, it's new year's eve 1965, then three minutes later, it's back to 1963 again. martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago, and a couple of scenes later, this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off, the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture (or pictures, in some cases, as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same time).if you want to watch this film, you have to watch this film, but i'd advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. wolfman jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background, but where'd he go? maybe he couldn't keep up with this film, either, and quit! 2 out of 10 stars!

i really don't think producer george lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as "more american graffiti" turned out to be. but in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. coming straight off the huge success of "american graffiti" and produced basically at the same time as "star wars", this film was the first that lucas successfully took away from coppola without having to bother directing it himself. the result is typical lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. the writer/director bill norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. while it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical "last big night" before school ends and kurt (ron dreyfuss) and steve (ron howard) are supposed to go off to college. one thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. there's a disposition of time, like in nick ray's "rebel without a cause" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. "more american graffiti" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with toad (charles martin smith) off in vietnam, his former girlfriend debbie (candy clark) partying with hippies in san francisco, steve and laurie (cindy williams) involved in student protests in berkeley, and john miler (paul le mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. in a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch john race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original. instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time, just seeing various events on new years eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. it's easy for the audience to become confused, and i think it's fair to say that we do. while the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film.the best parts of the movie to me are the ones with candy clark in sf and charles martin smith in nam. some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other. a good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better, and if the other parts weren't such a drag. speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and throwing in mackenzie phillips for a cameo didn't help at all. it was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why curt isn't in the movie because he's already in canada. instead laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. there's a black kind of satire to some of the vietnam stuff, very similar to what i would imagine lucas and john milius' original idea for "apocalypse now" would have been like. and there's some of that manic fun in the san francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. but still along with that fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if anyone wants to see steve and laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. i think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful, it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything. it just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freeze frame imitation of "two-lane blacktop" and so many better films.like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable. the performances by country joe and the fish are great, and scott glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with candy clark is a sight to see -- i wonder if even back then he had to use a wig? i couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has some small affection in my heart because i love the original so much. every couple of decades i guess i have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as i remember it being. it's a party killer but it's something that every fan of "american graffiti" or george lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. it shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. it makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that lucas actually made such a good movie as "american graffiti" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for bill norton.

like a lot of people, i loved the original; "american graffiti" was one of the great movies of the 70s. the sequel, "more american graffiti" is a horrible, depressing mess of a movie. it wasn't funny, the wide-eyed, likable characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were contrived (such as "laurie's" character having another brother because richard dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and "terry the toad" and "pharaoh joe" somehow managing to serve together in vietnam). they even have a police officer by the name of "falfa" (harrison ford's character in the original) who makes a "cameo". he doesn't even look like harrison ford, who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage.the operative word here is "funny". this movie isn't even amusing. debbie (candy clark) is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope spoking hippies and trying to bail her dealer boyfriend out of jail; steve and laurie (ron howard and cindy williams), the lovebirds in the original, have two kids and have become an annoying, bickering couple; adorable little tomboy carol (mackenzie phillips) has become "rainbow", yet another hippie child. john milner (paul lemat) is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original. even wolfman jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original, and gave it such a great flow, only is heard sporadically.perhaps it was different writers, a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failure.the episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel. it was a movie that didn't need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie "american graffiti" was and avoid the movie with "more" in the title.

as with many sequels, this one just doesn't have the quality or the impact of the original. the first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats. this one just doesn't cut it. the first film had a magical "good time" feeling about it that is totally missing from this film. we became enamored of all these characters (minus richard dreyfuss) in an age of innocence. now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different people. while this is what happens in real life, we don't expect this to happen to our favorite film characters! the film doesn't have the humor that the original had, and we were expecting to laugh. what little humor is there is dark. the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever, while this one is good but not even close to the original's. this film is so totally different from the original that it isn't even actually a sequel. i gave it a 4.

the final frames of the original "american graffiti" provide one-line summaries of the fates of the film's four central male characters. while somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters, the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the movie would want. however, someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by detailing the dreary lives of these characters after the original film ended. bad move. making an insurance salesman and his wife, a nerdy private in vietnam, a drag race driver, and a overgrown hippie into interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this nearly unwatchable movie. while most of the original cast is back, with only richard dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, "more american graffiti" is a mess of silly situations that involve protests, car races, country singers, and the vietnam war. the use of split screens, once thought innovative and daring, is overused here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused goings one. this is a sequel that demonstrates nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel. perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson. even the use of period music, which was a delight in the original, is poorly done here. if you want more "american graffiti," see the original twice.

the trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, or a lemon: there's little middle ground. putting it gently, this is not "berlin - symphony of a city" or "man with a movie camera". unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either.the problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if michael moore had come on board. it doesn't really have anything to say, or rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis. this is just a patchwork in search of a point. (though, quite inadvertently, the movie tells us more about the mind of uncle sam than it intends. there is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilisation, anti-media movie that is so profoundly souped up with technology. 'do as i say, and not as i do'. you just gotta love the yanks, eh.) tonally, there's something sour and misanthropic about this episode. both the prior episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration; this time the tone is consistently glum. it simply doesn't work over this duration, as gustav mahler will tell you.stylistically, naqoyqatsi is a mess. the whizzy digital stuff is particularly misguided. it gives the whole thing a totally fussy, overprocessed look, and it also undermines the 'realist' nature of the analogue 'found footage'. (i mean, i pity the guys. part of the joy of koyanisqaatsi was that it was a homage to the use of optical film. but now optical film's an historical artifact, they have to 'take on board' the digital domain; but i don't think they bring it off. the digital stuff often looks like video links from cnn or bbc world.) and with the "found footage", well, the digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just silly, and the false colour and solarisation kept me thinking of......ahem...james bond title sequences.ahem. odd as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by yo yo ma's performance; it's about as unobtrusive as a lawrence olivier voice-over. the images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma.philip glass himself is on odd form; never expected him to knock off the verdi requiem! (made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired response to any part of this movie). there's even one piece of music that sounds like brahms. (?) perhaps they've changed his pills.from our 'idle questions' department: is geoffrey reggio actually a hopi indian at all? or did he just do a sweatlodge in hollywood hills? oh, and are the various snippets bits of footage from earlier 'episodes' in the trilogy a commentary on the way these movies, too, are part of the global media slushy?

koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film i've ever seen. it's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place. some scenes are not "nice" or "beautiful", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. this is exactly what's happening here. the camera is used to intrude, to disgrace and to ridicule. there is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan. the music is disturbing. just as i rated koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this one is the worst. it's a "pure" movie, too, but this is the negative form, exactly that which should *not* be done.

dear reader, watch out! this movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the impertinence to call it so. if you have not been warned about its content, here it goes: the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling, concept. they could be called, therefore, symbols. the images are accompanied by a soundtrack, it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well. however, the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience, because they are, in an overwhelming number, american icons. though the film is intended to express the idea of "civilized warfare", it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is far too long and tiresome, and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with "war", in whichever conception. to conclude, i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary, a movie which is not a movie, a "something" whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.

people, get a clue! i mean, the writers dont have one, so i would expect you to...this show is such a pale imitation of the '60 show that you can laugh at it! and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects, and is in b&w fer chrissakes! yet the mood and the writing on the old show is miles ahead of this drivel. get hip kids! if 98 degrees or brittany told you to watch it, you would! you know it! just bypass them and tell all your friends you were 'in' with the 'scene' before it became too cool!

what i hoped for (or even expected) was the well known "stop motion" imagery and extreme slow motions, extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes. in short: the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. the stuff that made the other qatsi's hits.i just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.having watched the movie i got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping. that's fine, especially since the message is so valid. but i already knew the message, and it appeared there was nothing else left for me. more then half the film was solarized or colorized or posterized or transformed through some other filter. it looked a lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use. a lot of the images would have been prettier without the filters, like the giraffe and zebra chase. you could say that 'technology or whatever human based malicious source disfigured our beautiful nature' but why use these seventies effects to symbolize that? at the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this cheap looking effect i was ready to leave. the hope that the rest just couldn't be that bad made me stay. but then there was the slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture. but if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames a second, then there's just not enough motion to slow down. please, record the motion-to-be-slowed faster, like was done with the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water (some of) the laughing people and the drill song singing soldiers. i acknowledge that archive pictures can't be redone, but i had already seen a lot of that footage anyway, it could have done without it. it must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage, and the effects can't have been that easy to apply and arrange as well. on top of that, a lot of the work was mixed with each other. it shows that the creator wasn't out to lengthen the movie or to spare himself. but i didn't like the mixed stuff one bit... the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even clever, but the implementation was insufficient. the computer generated images didn't bother me that much, however out of date. the 'bits' streaming along circuits (in the first part of the film) looked more recent and were nice. mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal-mountain was less. i was pleased to hear a cello playing a major role in the music. a little less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with glass' music, but that's a matter of taste. as is all of the above, of course. i do hope that there will be another qatsi story to tell soon, where computer imagery will have a less significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again.

there seems to be a spectrum of cinema. on the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes. in the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. on the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.i'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. such is the case with naqoyqatsi.i had no idea what to expect when i saw it advertised. a few friends were going and asked if i wanted to come along. none of us knew what to expect, and by the end, none of us were pleased.yes, there are breathtaking images. yes, i'm amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to in searching through archival footage. yes, the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to, and probably the best part of the experience. the thing is, this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum i mentioned that i can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole.it's preachy. it's a jumble of symbolism and obvious morality. it's not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way. it's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can even figure out what it's saying).this movie is simply art for art's sake. an attempt to say "look at how deep and thought-provoking we can be by using montage!" when a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject, it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self-gratification.

i was very disappointed in this film. the director has shown some talent in his other endeavors, but this just seemed to be filler. there may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.i would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. as i watched it, i kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. at the end of the movie i was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way. i could only say to myself, "what was that?"there were a few really striking parts of the film, but not enough to warrant sitting through it again.

the peace and beauty of koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world. in naqoyqatsi, we are assaulted by images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent, and the digital -- the destructive constructs of our culture.some liberties are taken with the images, with posterization, distressing, and much slow motion. the connections between the sequences are inscrutable, if there are any. naqoyqatsi is defined at the film's end, a missed opportunity to place the images in context.the film is difficult to watch, the quality of the archival footage uneven, and it's most redeeming qualities are its theme and the hypnotic score of philip glass.

koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. they got too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. the executive producer puts his own image in the film... its just pretentious. maybe if they had more than $3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. i actually thought steven soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but godfrey reggio the director of koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi directed this. i'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film. you would think that francis ford coppola would have wanted to be a part of this film and help get more money together.

the first two movies of this series excelled for their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the midst of society. this movie doesn't have any of that natural footage, which i understand is part of the point, but it really makes the entire video component of the film seem like random images stuck together-- ones and zeroes flying around, computer models of human skeletons, and so forth. occasionally the stock footage is put to good effect (the nationalism/finance segment around 35:00), but usually it makes the video appear to lack any meaningful content, and demands you accept the context of the stock photographers rather than the context of the director. it's no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine. three stars added for the philip glass soundtrack.

please?! if this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, i think i missed his entire point. because i walked out feeling like reggio relied on cold-war-era footage of space exploration, and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology. trails of 1 and 0, denoting technology and math and science -- done that. anyone out there see the matrix? and motion studies of people in motion? ever heard of edward muybridge? at least he uses exact clips of muybridge's photographs of human motion studies.this film was derivative, and the score is just enough philip glass to sound like everything he's done in the past 10 years... avoid this film at all costs!!

the director godfrey reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two qatsi films, is hopelessly jumbled here. athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, laughing heads, etc, mingle without purpose. the parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from getty images et al, and the heavy-handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable. surely someone involved (steven soderbergh, executive producer?) could have pointed out that applying a solarizing filter to nearly every frame was a very bad idea? the crude looping, layering, and distorting of images recalls a freshman photoshop class. and to make matters worse, the computer animation sequences are more artless than a 1980's wall street pie-chart. this is not to say that improved aesthetics alone would have salvaged this film, but some meager effort in this direction may have made it tolerable as visual fodder for the accompanying music. i feel compelled to point out that the score by philip glass will certainly satisfy his fans. not a radical departure, but rather a refinement of what glass does best with lovely violin contributions by yo yo ma. if you decide to see this film be certain to focus your attention on the brief opening sequence. while you may already be familiar with detroit's once majestic but long abandoned michigan central railroad station 89 minutes later you will find yourself remembering this image of 20th century decay as the critical point when you should have headed for the exit sign/hit the stop button, etc. you've been warned.

i've seen all 3 now. i just can't believe how bad naqoyqatsi is. not in comparison to the others, but simply on it's own merit, or lack of. i can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. i gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. they were thought provoking and beautifully done. i gave this movie a rating of 1. if a 0 or negative number was available, i would have given it that rating instead. what a total waste of time it was watching this movie. i thought after the first 30 minutes that i should turn it off, but then i figured that it was just a (very) slow starting movie. i thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. then i realized that it wasn't going to get any better.it's very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities. don't take my word for it, watch it yourself. be sure to see the first two movies before this one. if you see this one first, i can just about guarantee that you'll never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "piece of work".the best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end. that's when your penance on this earth is complete and you can foregoe 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering that you've endured watching this "film". if god is truely merciful, he'll be more generous.

having enjoyed koyaanisqatsi and powaqatsi i was looking forward to this third part of the qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken. rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. although it tries to represent "civilised warfare" in the form of sport, science, trade and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. war is chaos, but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals.naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme. on the plus side, it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century's wars.naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times i had to remind myself that i was not watching an advertisement promoting the american way of life. perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "war on terror". when representing "sport as war" the prominent team logos ensured that the usa was depicted as the winner. hence it missed the opportunity to depict some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilised warfare.apart from newsreel, the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of new york and there was little recognition of "life as war" in the rest of the world. the gallery of faces (waxworks) gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the usa. the makers missed the point that globalisation does not mean americanisation.the philip glass soundtrack sounded much like every other philip glass score i've heard (with the possible exception of koyaanisqatsi) and at best can be described as "inoffensive" neither adding to, nor detracting from, the chaotic imagery.

o dear god i suffered having to watch this film four times in my sisters house and was it dreadful a story of sex and guns and very cheap unexplained acting unless you are at gunpoint being told to watch this avoid it ja rule just proved he cannot act ving rhames also gave the most dreadful acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this i have seem some dreadful films in my life but this would be in my five worst films ever the music in it wasn't good and the storyline i think was made up by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down wrote ten bullet points and then made it into a film absolutely dreadful

i am a gigantic fan of both koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. the reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. i really, really wish i had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. maybe my expectations were too high, but i felt let down.the score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh. it was good enough, though, that i'll still probably check out the soundtrack.but just keep this in mind if you see this film: if you come to realize at any point that you're not enjoying it, go ahead and split - you won't miss a thing, because it won't get any better.i'll even give the executive summary here (warning! spoilers!): lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a nike commercial, shots of smiling people, inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people's wax dummies (wtf were they thinking here?!?), some giggling babies (cuuuuute), some "bitchin'" photoshop effects, some imagery that's meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water, information, money and people (i think)... and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence... and then a bunch of stock space footage.i could remake this movie in 10 seconds. here's my pitch:2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string; 5 seconds of that scene in "network" where the guy talks about messing with the "elemental forces of nature" and how "money flows in, money flows out;" 1 second of reginald denny getting brained with a brick, and then 3 seconds of alan bean bouncing around on the moon. there you go - that's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life i just saved. of course, i'd get a copy of after effects and apply a filter or two, so it wouldn't look as blatantly stock as it is. if steven soderbergh's reading this, hey, i won't even need much money for this project...if you insist upon watching a movie about "life as war," i suggest "bowling for columbine" instead. it may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd, but at least it's funny.

this is a failure so complete as to make me angry.all of the subtlety and structure of reggio's early films is gone, leaving nothing but a hash of digitally smeared images whose sole purpose seems to be whining about bad things humans do. just how do star trek-like wormhole graphics, slo-mo colorized seascapes, mutiplicities of obviously fake computer icons, and shots of athletic competition that, incidentally, show that no one has ever been able to top (or even match) leni riefenstahl for filming bodies in motion, edited together with an overlay of video colorization that a 1980s "dr. who" producer would have rejected as "too cheesy," add up to a polemic against "civilized violence"? there is no intellectual, emotional, or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by reggio and way too many digital effects artistes, and the cautionary tale i assume he wanted to produce. with all of the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one seems to have pulled his head out the his own feeling of saying something important and considered that they might all be failing to say something new.only people who watch too much television could make such a film and believe that it's meaningful; this is kindergarten stan brakhage, and ultimately gutless in its relentless obviousness. the only irony and tension evident here (unlike in "koyaanisqatsi" where the relentless beauty and strangeness of time-altered ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning) was when the dvd i was watching jammed and skipped. this is mtv for the noam chomsky crowd, based on reflex rather than reflection and signifying nothing. two stars for the music, which is in glass's best pomo-cesar franck style and features some passionate cello from yo-yo ma. (i hope for his sake that he didn't have to record his parts to a playback of the film; there are some things you shouldn't have to do even for a paycheck.)

what a disappointment! i've enjoyed the jon cleary books about scobie malone, but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone. in the books he's a city detective, who is devoted to his wife and doesn't get involved in fisticuffs. for the film the character has been spiced up, into an outback copper who uses his fists and isn't averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl, though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him i don't know; taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy.but his character's stamina is remarkable; he flies in from australia, apparently goes straight to the commissioner's house (rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black-tie reception), saves him from assassination (getting into a fight in the process), goes to a casino with one girl, leaves with another and takes her to bed. so much for jet lag! on the way back to the commissioner's house (showing a good knowledge of london back streets), he gets beaten up by the baddies, but is still first down to breakfast! it's also remarkable that the commissioner's limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock-activated bomb.the best thing is joseph the butler's disdain for the uncouth malone. and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue, though some scenes take place during the wimbledon tennis week.

if any movie ever made italians look bad, this is it.duke mitchell - what an a--hole. duke mitchell, i s--t on your grave. seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the ku klux klan or skinheads. awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be all bad, right? wrong. typical softheaded sentimental tripe.while i do understand why some people might be struck by and even, to a certain extent, admire the film's audacious, totally un-pc verve (it's certainly unashamed of its own hatefulness and sense of self-involvement), but this doesn't change the fact that the main character, mimi (and, by extension, duke mitchell), is thoroughly loathsome human being who earns not one iota of empathy or interest, especially given that duke mitchell is such a complete bore as a performer. but what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame (apart from this dog t--d of a movie) was being a second rate dean martin imitator?

that is the answer. the question is: what is the single reason to watch this movie? i loved her in "my name is julia ross." that is one of the best films noir of all time. noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.she is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. that would be "the guilt of janet ames." this one has a spooky, promising title. it has a good cast. it has a fine director. i was expecting something dark. maybe something a little tawdry. instead, it's an uninspired, routine espionage movie. it's pretty much is a total bore. at least it was to me. ms. foch is captivating. and that is about it.

we've all got to start somewhere, it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like budd boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. in fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on june 25, 1945.the war on europe was over for almost two months, of course not even harry cohn could control the events of history. so i'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a nazi spy ring was helping out the japanese. another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the fbi had nothing to do with the pacific or asian theater. the cloak and dagger stuff was the territory of the oss in that part of the world.when you're an fbi man like william wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like nina foch. he's about to go on a mission to the orient to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general uprising in china against the japanese occupation. germans who've been bugging otto kruger's house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who've already lost the war trying to help their allies. who, by the way, they refer to as 'japs'. when foch is sideswiped by a speeding car and knocked unconscious she dreams about wright's danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the golden gate bridge. she goes there and foils the plot. all the stuff you'd expect from a nice noir film is there, the foggy atmosphere of san francisco, the dimly lit sets, budd boetticher tried his best as did the cast. but they just weren't convincing, probably because they didn't believe this claptrap themselves.it's possible, but not likely that nina foch's dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor. i think it was just a lousy screenplay. and budd and harry cohn at columbia pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here.

a tedious effort from not-yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress nina foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a certain kind of b movie. it's just not the good kind. and a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted.basic plot -- nina, a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves, has a nightmare. she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather, and realizes he's in the dream, even though she's never met him before. meanwhile, it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy, and is about to go on an-extra secret, hush-hush mission that must not fail.of course, there are nazis. and plot holes. and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes, so that the running time can be spun out past an hour. at the end, the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly. if the fbi and oss had acted like this crew, we'd have lost the war in '42.the movie itself is rather flatly shot (despite the best efforts of the fog machine) and the acting -- as it seems to be in many of the columbia bs tcm has been showing lately -- is curiously unengaged. it's less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie, but also less fun to watch.boetticher's strength, of course, is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the fore. maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule.

this version of "the magic flute" is not only the worst production of mozart's great opera that i have ever seen, it is also the worst video production i have seen of any opera.i'm a big opera fan and i have more opera on dvd than movies. the sets are cheap and cheesy. papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. he is just dressed like some guy. the sound is in mono. the color is really bad. it is saturated in orange. most dvd's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one. also, the language has been changed to swedish instead of the original german.this is not a movie version of "the magic flute." it is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well. you can pick any other available dvd of this opera and i guarantee it will be better than this one. my preference is for the version conducted by james levine with sets by david hockney.

the positives: it's shot pretty well. has some interesting peripheral characters. likable main character (albeit weak).the bad: plot/story. editing. characters wasted. jessica alba.i'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducingly bad. i don't understand how anyone can hand over $12m to this guy jenkin. and before i go any further, i just want to say that i don't dislike jessica alba--i really wanted to like her in this film. however, jessica alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable. she has absolutely no screen presence in this movie, and she ruins every scene she's in. needless to say, the romance does not come off as believable(not even a tiny bit).all i saw throughout was the actors flapping their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground with what little they were given--but sadly, all this movie does is sink. there is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing is gained. it's a pretty empty movie.

it is difficult to rate a writer/director's first effort. after all, it is one more movie than i have written or directed. james hunter wrote a story that was interesting, but suffered from an uneven flow.after all, the idea that a man (ja rule) has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common, and even falling in love with the daughter (tatyana ali) of the man you killed has been done. doing it again demands something that is original, and originality is lacking in this film.i was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites: tia carrere (trues lies, wayne's world), pam grier (jackie brown), frank langella (dracula, good night and good luck), and ving rhames (rosewood, dawn of the dead). they did not disappoint in their performances, but they had little to work with.direct to video is becoming more and more common, but that doesn't mean it has to be a waste of time. maybe the sophomore effort of hunter will be more enjoyable.

why did i buy this movie on dvd?, well the short answer would be: i really don't know. as for the longer version, it pretty much comes down to the fact that i genuinely like tatyana ali and she plays alicia in this.now does tatyana ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie? i must say that it is one of the better, and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress. i am very much looking forward to see her in action, when better material will be available.this being said, this movie was terrible - and my score is given based on this: 1 star for not being the worst movie i've seen, 1 star for the performance of tatyana ali, and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars, there are worse movies for that.ja rule should stick to rapping, not my favourite rapper to say the least, but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there, i would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.ving rhames: ah man, marcellus wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man. just because michael caine is a fiercely brilliant actor, who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good, you don't have to copy him ving.the rest of the semi big names in the cast: it's ok, there are bills to be paid, and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time.the movie itself. it so massively flawed, it's pretty difficult to know where to start. it's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together, as were the director to say "we need to tell this, and we need to tell that". there is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it. to say the least, the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time.to sum up in one word: reallynotgood

i say ben johnson and my fellow canadians say, "ben johnson?!" - he was a goddam movie star guys, a cowboy, and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for tv disaster movies such as this, cashing in on the deadly swarms of killer bees that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time. so there's these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm. the cops are like, what do we do? uh, bees die when it's cold. so where could we make it cold? i know - the stadium in new orleans! so they drive this car and its attendant swarm of killer bees on and on through the streets of new orleans, with a bullhorn saying "get off the streets or you will be stung to death." and the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets so becomes the narcotic doom of this particular buncha bees. i don't know which is the greater indignity on this great city...well i do, but this one sucks too. most appropriately viewed on an extremely faded-to-orange 16mm print, although betamax is a good alternative!

first, this movie was made in 1978. so that tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway.but i am not saying that all old movies are bad . second, the special effects we're terrible for even that time. finally, the acting was so bad, bozo the clown could have done it better. it makes you wonder how people get the money to make movies this pathetic. this movie sucks!

1) bad acting.2) for a bunch of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background.3) terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left, right and center.4) cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie)5) interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching space 1999 a lot). too bad it blows up so early. the escape ship also got sunk too fast. *sigh*6) anthropologists might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior.

a spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world, have not gone extinct...yet. the survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white, and yellow suits, fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters."planet of the dinosaurs" is a peculiar movie. like i said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors. the models are crude, but effectively animated. and they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and speaking lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single revision. obviously, most of the budget was put into the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there's not nearly enough to save us from our boredom. these human characters are only there to scream, run around, and mutter these poorly-written and verbose speeches about survival. and unfortunately, not nearly enough of them get eaten by the dinosaurs.overall, "planet of the dinosaurs" is not a film i plan on seeing again. some people will simply love it for being so cheap and so poorly made. sometimes, i enjoy movies like this. but this particular film is just too long, too boring, and very exhausting on the mind.

now, i love bad, old skifee movies as much as most people. and i understand that a budget is a budget. that said, planet of the dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get. the thing has no actors, and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore. there are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid. the only thing not wasted was paper...the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long. surely no one actually wrote dialogue this pointless. i'm constantly amazed that such movies ever got made, much less released. i'm only glad i didn't pay to see this waste of time. it's 75 minutes of my life i'll never get back.

after the success of star wars, there was a boost in interest in sci-fi movies. this was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly.a group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed off (the people not the dinosaurs). porn-movie level acting. cheap special effects, even for the time, although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them.costumes were pure 1970's, as were the hairstyles. ahh, the 70's. i expected a disco to break out at any minute.nothing to really recommend in this film.

the first half of the movie is not that bad actually. although there's not really too much depth in the characters, the story is somehow funny and generally ok with potential to get better, which it doesn't.in the second half things start to turn for the worse, not only for the characters in the movie, but also for the viewer, who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious end.the previous user comment mentioned: "it's a love story, a road movie, a thriller, a comedy of errors, an 80's movie and most of all, it's a jonathan demme movie."well, please allow me to rephrase that: "it's a boy gets girl story, they happen to be driving around in cars, the thrill is gone as it is all too clear how things will evolve, there wasn't any scene in this film to which one might laugh out loud, it does have some slight 80's feeling and yes, jonathan demme really was the director."

i couldn't even sit through the whole thing! this movie was a piece of crap! i had more fun watching "dont' tell mom the babysitter's dead"! it was just too painful to watch. say, besides "austin powers", has tom arnold ever been in a hit movie?

i don't care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film. what was john landis thinking?i know it's based on a series of children's books, but c'mon! even kids hate this movie. it's pointless and boring. tom arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money.i think the only reason the stupids hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage. at least hobgoblins made it on mst3k.

this movie was chosen, quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store. it turned out to be quite a pig. the plot line-such as it is-was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable. the actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines. the only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertant deployment of an airbag. the remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters (aged less than ten years), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even the cat or the dog. my advice, if you are tempted to borrow this turkey, is to save your money and your time. look for something else...

would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word "stupid" over and over again? probably.this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen. seriously. there are better movies on mystery science theater 3000. i saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. even though it was actually *with friends* and at one of their *birthday parties,* i had to leave. i actually had to leave. i just excused myself and walked out. fortunately, some of the parents were doing the same thing, so i didn't look like a total jerk... anyway, this film is awful. there is nothing to like about it. it's painfully (as in actually causing physical pain) slow, and sickeningly (literally does induce vomiting) unfunny. you almost feel sorry for tom arnold, but then you don't because you remember he was actually in the movie. it really does pain me to even think about it.it was on tv a few months ago, and i decided i had to watch it all the way through, just once. i remembered then why i walked out in the first place, and felt guilty for boosting its ratings by even one viewer. the gags aren't funny, the characters arn't interesting. it's just a senseless mess of pratfalls and stupidity.there is a small crowd of then-eight-year-old kids who watched the movie when it came out and considered it "brilliant." if you think that having your face removed piece by pece with an ice cream scoop is brilliant, then by all means, go rent it. but if you have any dignity whatsoever avoid this big stupid mess altogether. score: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1, actually.

this is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie i have ever seen. it's been a long time since i've seen it, but the jokes are not funny, the plot is painfully forseeable, calling the main characters stupid is to vastly upgrade their intelligence...uggh! i just wanted to punch tom arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when i was done watching this piece of cinematic filth. i don't even know why i ever wanted to watch it, but remember if you see this movie: don't say i didn't warn you.ps tom arnold's character sings a song in this movie called "i'm my own grandfather." nuff said.

this is probably the only film i've seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "the stupids" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like john landis. and that's what makes it great.in order to appreciate "the stupids", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director abo kyrou: "i urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime." in order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. for example, when you watch "freddy got fingered" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant.it works with good movies too. if "jaws" hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. but, a lot of people think "jaws" is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. but it has it's strengths, doesn't it? the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. jim jarmusch made a compelling defense of "showgirls" once, and even afterwards i still can't see it from his p.o.v. doesn't mean he's wrong though. if you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and no i do not mean stoned, i'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is.the defenders and haters of this film are right: it's stupid, and that's the point. the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "the jerk" accepted navin johnson's idiocy. and because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. a "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like "the stupids" knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning.i can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why i give it such a low rating. the acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the live-action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon. but i can't deny that it is entertaining in its own way, and that's why i defend it. i got it right away, and i pity those who don't.i'll admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say "release the drive bee!" would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy, i was never bored, and never disappointed. in fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). they were dumb, but they were funny. and the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else: a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself.and that's exactly why it works.

i just saw this movie. i liked the soundtrack.i saw first the trailer and was magnificent, like all hollywood movies, they know how to sell.but the movie is almost awful, first 30 minutes are interesting, but then.... like almost all new movies they blow it up. i don't get the idea, why that kid died??is a cliché, every nigga' movie must have a kid to be killed, and everybody must become good after his death.lol.i don't understand what is the connection with the movie... and is so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes.nothing new in this movie. i saw 'you got served' same idea but also... something new... this is something like 'honey', but is not a little bit difference between them.if you have no other option watch this movie, but be sure is the last option you take. and the choreography is worst than everything before. this is not a must see for sure...

seriously i don't get why people are all like "oh my god step up is the best movie ever!!!" it's a bunch of junk! the acting, first of all, is ridiculous, and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible...movies are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say, was *not* entertainment. i was actually laughing because i was so embarrassed watching it. the music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well. and what's with the channing tatum "hotness" that all the girls talk about? whatever. the movie was pathetic. don't waste your time - or your money. unless you're a dancing movie freak, but movies like that are *not* movies...they're jokes.

i gave this a 2, and it only avoided a 1 because of the occasional unintentional laugh. the film is excruciatingly boring, and incredibly cheap. it's even worse if you know anything at all about the fantastic four.

i am almost a two decade old human who's been reading comics most of my life. i'm not a huge fan of the fantastic four, but i'm fairly familiar with them. in 1994, roger corman (b-movie legend) produced the first, i think, feature length fantastic four film. the result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release. still, copies exist, mostly on the net and at conventions. if you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy do yourself a favor and check this thing out.the film basically retells the ff's origin and an encounter with doctor doom and a villain named the jeweler, essentially the mole man with a penchant for petty larceny. as is the case with these comic book movies, everything has to tie into everything, so the ff play a vital role in dr. doom's creation, and he and the jeweler play a vital role in theirs.first, i'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie, i actually sort of liked the guy that played doom. he doesn't get many decent lines, but when he does he hits them. the armor looks pretty good too.as for the rest...it's a dirty, dirty mess. bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, bad everything basically. boos especially to jay underwood, bringing new meaning to the word overacting as johnny storm. he's not overacting, he's ultracting.as for the ff, well they all sort of look right, and sue's played by a very attractive actress, but they just don't seem like a real team. for one thing they have no reason for sue and johnny to go into space. in an early section ben and reed go to visit the two, johnny's like 8 and sue's about 12. it only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a helluva lot creepier. the thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time the human torch is really a human torch he looks like the silver surfer tinted red.i could type for hours, but i think the scene that best sums it up is a climactic encounter featuring the aforementioned not-so-human torch. he's racing a laser beam, and he eventually destroys it with a punch. yes, a punch. a laser beam. with a punch. then he flies around and goes "yippeee!" a whole lot, whereupon the camera tilts down and he flies back toward earth. evidently reed the intellectual forgot to inform johnny that fire doesn't exist in the vacuum of space. this and many other scenes operate like looney toones, if the character doesn't know they are over a cliff, they don't fall.i laughed, i cried, i was glad it was never released.

when hulk hit theaters in 2003, it wasn't long before dvds of the old incredible hulk tv show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. we saw a similar occurrence a year prior when spider-man cartoons appeared on dvd to coincide with that hero's big screen debut. companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.so the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of wal-mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. i guess everyone involved would just rather forget. to be fair, the fantastic four is not as bad as everyone says. let me rephrase that. it's not as unentertaining as all of its negative reviews might suggest.veteran television actor alex hyde-white (no, you don't remember any of his roles) leads the way as reed richards, the brilliant scientist who, along with his crew, gains bizarre powers after an outer space mishap. he's left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths. his future wife, sue storm (rebecca staab), can suddenly turn invisible, while her brother, johnny (jay underwood), may now ignite himself at will. then there's poor ben grimm (michael bailey smith), the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy, orange rock.just as the friends are becoming accustomed to all of this, they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos. it seems reed's old colleague victor von doom (joseph culp) is living up to his name, and that villainous jeweler (ian trigger) isn't exactly helping old ladies cross the street, either. can our heroes save the day? of course they can; like any superhero movie, it's just a question of how and when.what's striking about the fantastic four is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect. the dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. the acting is so unpolished it makes a third-rate afternoon soap opera look like shakespeare. the special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget, but there are still some positively embarrassing moments. when the human torch fully ignites his body, for instance, the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon. i can just hear that production meeting. "oh, no one will notice. they'll be too intrigued by the action!" i mean really, a cartoon? at least give me a mannequin on fire held up by a string! prior to that, the scene in which the foursome come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teens-in-the-backyard fare. the crew simply found a field and lit a vaguely-spaceship-like object on fire. that's the only remnant of such a major disaster?of course there wasn't a whole lot to work with in the script. there is a fairly coherent story here, but it's all so simplified. when reed and ben decide to go into outer space, they simply drop by the storms' house and ask if they'd care to join them. is it really that easy? don't these sort of things require, oh, i don't know, years of training and expertise? not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in full house reruns. but as bad as that may be, nothing can compare to how painfully clichéd dr. doom is. he was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s, right down to the evil laugh and slamming his clenched fist down on the table to punctuate his remarks. no comic book, least of all fantastic four, has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensional.ultimately, the fantastic four is saved from being a complete turkey because it's just so damn innocent. you can tell the people involved, as little talent or experience as they had, really tried. they didn't know the final result would be so embarrassing. they were under the impression that this was their big break, that people would flock to the theaters. it bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with (and i'm sure half of that was eaten up by the cool thing costume). all things considered, they did well, and for its many flaws, the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans.

i never read the book. now i don't really want to. i had no clue what this movie was about when i walked into the theatre. i still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across, but i do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. two precious hours i can never get back.the storyline was so predictable, it's laughable. werewolves...or something...a very romeo and juliet type plot. i predicted the endig within five minutes into the movie. and i was correct.the acting isn't horrible. the only two cool characters in the movie were the british cousin guy and the rambo-graphic-novel duder. the other characters are too...the dialogue is very bland and predictable.the absolute worst part of the movie is the transformations between the "humans" and the "wolves." if you wanted something kick-ass like van helsings, you're gonna be really upset. imagine ballerina's, a bright light, then a wolf. yep...that's about it.just avoid this movie. period. especially if you've read the book, because you'll just wanna punch babies.

i'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. first is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. the second is from someone who has.(movie without book) from a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. nowhere near as good as either of the underworlds but much better than ultraviolet. and i'm not just talking plot line either. the visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice. the characters has very little development and vivian didn't even seem to truly care that her "love" was killing off what was left of her species. some of the other characters could have had more air-time, like the five. the plot was way to similar to underworld for my tastes.(movie with book) as many have stated, other than the title, character names and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are nothing alike. in the movie, gabriel was a lot older and was the father of rafe (thus astrid was once his mate). in the book, gab was about 24, never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life (astrid is trying to win his affection) and astrid was the mother of ulf, not rafe. another important thing is the location. the book took place in riverview, maryland. also, why they moved from west virginia is very different. the movie has it being vivian's fault and her entire family was killed due to it. in the book, the original leader of the five, named axel, killed a girl from their school. hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (viv's father included), forcing them to move. also, viv's mom, esme was a major character.one thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the "bitch's dance". for those who don't know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader (since earlier there was a fight for the males). vivian won it, trying to save her mother from astrid (who is a horrid evil woman in the book) and thus was supposed to mate with gab. there was no prophecy! anyway, if you've read the book and you liked the book, i highly suggest not seeing this film.

***may contain spoilers****i was super excited to go see blood and chocolate with my friends. i couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. but as soon as the movie started, i couldn't believe how different it was. at first i was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead...maybe it'll be okay. but then came the rest of the movie. by the time it was over i was furious. nothing was correct but their names and the fact that vivian fell in love with aiden. by the end of the book, gabriel was my all time favorite...and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot?! the movie also showed the shifters, or werewolves, as these vile, evil creatures were as the book shows them as just wanting to fit in and keep their pack safe. they would never kill humans for the fun of it.if they wanted to make a movie like they did, they should have given it a different title and named the characters different. because then i would go out and watch it again and buy it, but when i think about it all i can see is the bad. you couldn't pay me to go see it again or buy it.

from the makers of underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen. it is basically a reconstructed version of underworld, yet lacking vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a big deal), and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). a twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate maker named vivian is currently residing in romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in america for being werewolves. there, she belongs to a small society (or pack) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwillingly wed the pack leader, gabriel, whose son - some toad with a british accent - takes it upon himself to hunt outside of the pack. they have apparently been discovered in other countries prior and want to remain settled in romania by avoiding negative attention, so of course, such activity is considered forbidden. vivian ends up falling in love with an american artist who is oblivious to her involvement with the group of blood-thirsty predators. when they end up discovering the secret relationship, things get messy when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is set loose in the woods and is hunted - giving the pack a chance to transform into their "wolfy" selves. all this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf. very cheezy effects. the entire movie is like a tamed down underworld with some drippy, romantic montages and very little action. watching this in the theater, i could not wait for it to end. a devastatingly boring disappointment. avoid!

ok, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. when i'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book i turn to to fill in the time. i have 3 copies for god's sake. anyways, i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on! they could have done a little better than this. i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies. they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly i'm tired of watching it. i mean hello the best part of the whole f*****g (sorry) story is she ends up with gabriel. he doesn't die. what was that about? and he's old in this movie. gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da** it. awww. and astrid who the he** came up with the idea of astrid being vivian's aunt no no no no. astrid and vivian hate each other. awwww. anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously pi**ed off. hope this helped.
