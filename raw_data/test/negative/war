this movie was terrible. it is not something that people should have to pay to see. it looks like some christian group made it to convert people. i don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to tv.it started out like an old fashioned b movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. about 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about "god" and "do you believe in jesus?" it quickly moves into pure religion territory.i thought i was going to a sci-fi movie. the film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.avoid it!

calling this a "sunday school" movie might be generous, because, even as a christian, i found the religious message so one-dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church. the message is, "read your bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you won't get left behind at the rapture." there was no love. i guess when you get right down to it, i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film. the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula.aside from the spiritual/religious element, the script was tedious--saying the same thing over and over. that might have been to make up for some of the acting, which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time, so they just said the same thing over and over.i did enjoy the final scenes. i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a sunday school formula. the movie wasn't all bad, just most of it.i am in favor of more clean movies that are well-done and that present truth in a non-preachy way. this wasn't one of those, i am sorry to say. i took my family to this film, wanting to support that kind of movie. now i'd like my money back.

unfortunately, i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango. since i am a sci-fi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested me.instead, this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick. appropriate for an audience of like-minded individuals but very un-christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. shame on you! at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wild-eyed craziness.so, this b-grade movie (and i am being kind) production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups. but if you are a mainline christian or non-christian you will not be comfortable.

i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work. it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background "car sounds" audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in dog's car). production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times). sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part, completely unnecessary to the plot. to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves. the antique computer hardware is kind of interesting. this film was released in 1982 (not 1987 as the imdb database indicates) and then current "high tech" was an amber screen on a 4.8 mhz ibm pc with floppy drives. maybe the pc was the real star of the movie... at least it was interesting.we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at walmart. as the other reviewer notes, we paid too much!

this movie is from the 80s, but it looks like it was made in the stone age. the effects are way too cheesy. my copy has sandra bullock on the cover, which was why i bought the movie. she was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screentime. she would most likely deny all involvement.in short, there is no part of this movie worth seeing, except to laugh at how bad it sucks. rent this to see the worst film ever made, bar none.

but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.i got this dvd cheap, with sandra bullock as headliner on the case. this is false advertising - she's on-screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie.on the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes, the directing was ... well, let's just say that my 14-yo daughter could do better, but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me. it's possible that the family cat could have done better.sandra does a creditable job for a first film, in the short time she's on-screen - and that's the only redeeming quality of this film. stupid story, poorly written, and transferred to film as only a 7th-grade media class should be able to do.in short, this is dreck.

if you have ever shopped at wal-mart, then you probably know about the $5 dvd bin that sits by the electronics department. well, that is where i found this movie. however, i was tricked! you see, the cover of this particular dvd had a big picture of sandy bullock on it and even listed her name as a "headliner". i picked it up thinking, "wow, i didn't know sandra bullock did this movie?!?!" so i was pumped to go home and watch a cool sandra bullock movie. much to my surprise, ms. bullock had a small role.....very small role. she plays the girlfriend of the son of the cia agent. talk about supporting actress. she may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie. besides being deceived of this being a bullock flick, i looked past that and i continued to watch an "action-packed" film. negative! at one point, for special effects, a gun was taped to the camera. you gotta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is.

i won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating, plenty of other people have already done that. suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that i've owned on dvd, this is the only one that i got rid of- it was so worthless that i couldn't see ever wanting to watch any of it again.however, i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). while skimming through the 4 pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than 3 stars. looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less. it looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the imdb "bottom 100" list. it would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars (none of who wrote a review of the movie) are actual active users.don't be fooled, this movie isn't worth your time.

some sort of accolades must be given to `hellraiser: bloodline'. it's actually out full-mooned full moon. it bears all the marks of, say, your `demonic toys' or `puppet master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? full moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. these hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. this increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as i am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish. now it's just ish.

hellraiser: bloodline is only a so-so film. i believe it's the fourth installment in the hellraiser series.i missed the beginning, and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. but, using my wit and intelligence, (and the info button) i soon found out that the villain (pinhead) was released from pandora's box, which, i believe is a gateway straight to hell.so, anyways, pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the "toymaker's" family. and, that's about it. oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path. yawn.what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid, and then unleashes the dog on his wife, and then kills a random person. then he husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. who cares? why it fails is because hellraiser: bloodline is too corny to be scary. look at pinhead's minion of creatures: a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are connected together, (siamese twins in a horror film?) and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort. (i haven't seen the previous films.) now look at the main villain. his name is pinhead. isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid? he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name, and a corny speech. somewhere in the film, two cops approach him and say "don't make us put some pain on you!" pinhead replies "pain? how dare you use that word! i am pain" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. it sounds a bit cliché if you ask me.don't forget the final half of the movie. the characters (and audience) get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. some person who we don't recognize (maybe he was in the previous films. i don't remember him in the beginning of the movie.) this scene is basically one thing played over and over again: a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise.some other guard: "oh no! he's down. i will go check on himby myself!"after he dies the same thing happens again.(spoilers) here's the thing i didn't get. in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end. so, how does he come back for another four films? are they prequels? why hasn't he died in the previous ones? geez. the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series. (end of spoilers) hellraiser: bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes, but has little thrill or scare value. just forget it. bad special effects with badeverything else make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror.good: wellsome people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning. plus, pinhead's voice is pretty cool. i suppose if you like ultra-violence, you might like this too.bad: none of the reasons above make this a very good film. the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. and, who names their villain pinhead?feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment.

there's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel, which piles on the naff visuals to no effect. good old alan smithee directed this one, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, by bruce ramsay) are terrorised by pinhead (doug bradley, wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). peter atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick. the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie's meagre running time, although this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended.

in the xxii century an architect by the name of merchant (bruce ramsay) commandeers a space station, which he personally designed. as can be predicted a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put merchant into custody. upon arrival they find him partaking in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious cubical. during interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish, what he has started or else the hell he has released will bathe in blood... in order to convince the officers holding him captive he reminisces about his heritage, about the toymaker who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in space...the movie that is essentially the same to hellraiser, that the quickening was to highlander. something to be ignored and forgotten, as so it won't influence the lore of hellraiser to much. by far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more low-grade feel to it than its predecessors (who let's face it were b or c class films).acting at times seems to be influenced by a mid-budget porn-flick with wooden unbelievable performances, that actually have you thinking: so when are they going to undress and start with the intercourse? surprisingly not much sex in the movie, albeit the introduction of the seductress-demon angelique (a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily messes with what we know of the world of hellraiser) offers ample opportunities for the love-making.basically the movie consists of three abruptly pasted together separate short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion. the end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the film.some decent gore in the flick, but apart from that an utter failure.

the plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only "star power" if we can call it that consists of joe estevez. i don't know what is more shocking. the fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. if you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them. someone even went as far as saying that the actress/writer could be the leading lady of the 90's. yeah! and joe estevez could have more money than his brother martin. if you want to check it out anyways i highly recommend watching the mts version of it. at least you'll laugh a lot without going insane.

soultaker was written by and starred vivian schilling. it also starred joe estevez, gregg thomsen, and robert d'zar as the angel of death.the story begins with introduction to soultaker, played by joe estevez. we quickly learn what soultaker's role will be in this movie.next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly named "summerfest". in this film, the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. the girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class. the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn't really clear or pertinent to the story.at summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why zach isn't encouraged to date natalie. soultaker makes an appearance as well, with apparently his boss the angel of death. here d'zar's character points out who is to die and who's souls are to be taken. it's revealed as well, that soultaker will have a character conflict regarding natalie, and how he deals with her because of someone in his past.meanwhile natalie is ditched by her ride to summerfest, and zach convinces her to ride home with them. during the ride home, soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds.the rest of the story surrounds the soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers, and zach and natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live. the class and character conflicts lay in the story, but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved.there's an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama, there's a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring. it's not really acceptable, and it would've been nice had this been dealt with differently, somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience.the story and acting are decent. the soundtrack is ok, and even the production values are good.robert d'zar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death. joe estevez does ok, however sometimes his role acting a bit flat. vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie, although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes.this may sound odd, but this movie definitely could've benefited from some pointless nudity. vivian teases us a bit but that wasn't enough.in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie. the results, it's worth watching. just don't expect a perfect production.3/10

the film soultaker is essentially an older form final destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them... the film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea... if this movie were remade with a few good actors/actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome... as for the actual film, i recommend watching the mst3k version, the pure version might be too boring to sit through, unless you love bad movies staring martin sheen's brother...

when a movie's claim to fame is that martin sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. "soultaker" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. it's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.the plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be. joe estevez isn't much of an actor, so luckily for the audience, he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking. this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror/fantasy franchise, considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher. 4 characters, each dies one at a time...will any live? who really cares. though it sounds like i hated this, i didn't. i just didn't like it very well, but i was interested through most of it, so i guess that counts for something.my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. pg-13 for language, violence and nudity.

now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs, and all my friends and i thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. but honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. sort of a hair metal, dokken version of carnival of souls. but a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular mst3k fodder usually contains. but if it was on cable, and i was bored and drinking beer--sure, i'd watch it again. but then again, i've watched howling vii about five times now, so maybe you really shouldn't be listening to me.anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie? and why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much?

okay, to be fair this movie did have an interesting concept. given a few script rewrites, some decent actors and a budget, this might have been a fairly decent cult flick instead of the mst3k fodder it turned out to be.still, it was better than "armageddon."

ok, i read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment'), and i have to admit that i can identify with his position.micheal, i hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other, better things. i've seen this movie in the mst3k form. even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots, i saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it. and this is one of those films ("mitchell" is another) where the mst3k crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better. you know they had some unfair fun at the actress' expense because it made for a livelier episode.imo, the fact that the movie actually tried to be about something, and had a few decent, effective moments here and there, should keep it out of the 'bottom 100' ("tangents/time chasers" is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there either).but it is still not a very good movie. i don't blame the writer/lead actress for being who she is. it's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film. the writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash, and the dialog is often barely up to abc afterschool special standards. the cast sincerely gives it their best effort, and the acting in general is definitely head-and-shoulders above abortions like "future war" or "space mutiny", but there aren't any really professional level performances here, with the exception of 'big joe' estevez, who is hammy but suitably intense. i never saw the full original cut, but mst's sampling of "soultaker" was representative enough to make these facts plain.oh, and the film has robert z'dar in it. that is, imo, a real 'kiss of death' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously. yes, he's big and scary looking in his role, but i just hate the guy as an actor. (in real life, i wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable).there were little things i liked about the film. for instance, the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable. the idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects, and i respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable. it didn't really work, but it might have with just a little more tweaking.so anyway, mr. rissi, better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from watching something else you did if the 'buzz' was good. and ms. miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the movie wasn't that bad.

ok, i saw this film through mystery science theater 3000, but i did see the movie, so i figured i would leave a comment on it. i just love once again how joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the oscar winning roles left and right. soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. it seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities. this is one of my favorite mst3k episodes, simple because a lot of what they mention is what we are thinking throughout the film and i'll explain why in a moment.natalie and zach are a couple who broke up and are now trying to work things over. but since zach is in upper lower class and natalie is in middle class, it just ain't gonna work. but on the way home, they and zach's friends get into a car accident and now the angel of death/soultaker is after them to meet his quota of soultaking. but also it seems like he's had some kind of other life relationship with natalie and just can't seem to move on. so now natalie and zach must race against the ever appearing five million times a minute clock to save their souls and lives.well, i guess zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven, i wonder if black sabbith was wrong too, lol. basically there are a lot of plot holes in this movies, like no one can see the characters and they can't be killed, yet somehow they can still press buttons and open doors? the angel of death had a very strange face and was a bit distracting from the story itself. soultaker was just a lousy film that was rushed and makes you just feel so bad for joe, the under-appreciated sheen/estovez brother.2/10

that's how i was when i walked (staggered) out of this "film". i couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. i was stuck in the middle. trapped.the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen. the daughter was a stand out performance - stand out in the bad sense.thge cinematography was hideous, consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i've witnessed.as for the stock footage... well at first one...wait.why am i reviewing this film? why do i acknowledge its existence? please, don't watch it. do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry.

to me, this movie was just plain confusing, slow, and uninteresting. why did the aliens choose to communicate through ants? it makes no sense. the ending was muddled and made no sense whatsoever. in the end, i was hoping that the ants would kill everyone.avoid this one at all costs. not even mst3k could save it.

ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs, watermellons, people, etc. this may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film phase iv. this is not because they want to, but because they have to.the movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth, and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population. the movie is broken up in segments; the first part after the cosmic event is phase i, and so on until the end of the movie, which is phase iv.what is phase iv? who knows? we don't get to see that part; presumably it has something to do with the bonding of one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl who lived in the area. the girl, who looks like a cross between alicia silverstone and liv tyler, is mad at the ants because they killed her horse, but except for one angry outburst, goes around the biodome with a blank ("clueless"?) look.these ants are pretty smart; or the scientists are rather dumb. i'll give credit to the ants. why? anything that usually ruins my picnics that can then build reflecting towers, blow up trucks, and adapts to poison with the greatest of ease gets my vote for being the smarter species, at least in this movie.sterno says stomp on this anthill.

if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail. i guess they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly.the title of the movie "phase iv" is something of a mystery. this is not a spoiler, but "phase i" starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach "phase iv" until the end credits roll. apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1 - 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: "hang in there buddy! only 1 more phase until final credits!" as a mst3k episode, this one wasn't very good for two reasons: 1) this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) this movie is so bad not even j&tb can lighten it up. there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies.the movie does have a trick/surprise ending, but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me.

with a little dressing up, this movie could be served for thanksgiving dinner. not only is is boring, implausible, historically inaccurate and poorly directed, the best actors were the bit players (mainly because they had so few lines to say). a waste of time, even for war fanatics.

the only reason i didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable. hannibal is boring>boring> boring and boring!!! this film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. it's actually quite tame in that regard. the story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. i have the feeling that director ridley scott just phoned this one in. the actors are all fine they just needed some direction. the music score is also very annoying. it's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film. it does look good but that's not enough reason to see it. by the way did i mention that it's boring?

well, 1st off i haven't seen "silence of the lambs" yet.... but, i think that i would have become sick if i would have seen it before this piece. not from the gruesome violence but, from the lack of everything else. anthony hopkins was very good as hannibal and i really believed that he was as psychotic as he played himself off to be but, from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with cliches from "silence" which left me lost at points where others were laughing at what was on the screen.now, i heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to gross folks out... he did it... but, only in 2 sequences? i mean, if you want it to be gruesome and i mean, so gruesome that you're going to play the film off of that... you need more than 2 sequences.. i always see it as a film has to either become that cinematic jewel which will ultimatley take you to another place and time or either go over the top (which most of the time is done in bad taste). but, this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times. anthony hopkins and julianne moore are the stars of the movie, right? well, with the exception of hopkins, i didn't feel that way.. who cared about the stupid italian police officer? i definatley didn't. so, really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. i mean, come on.. who cares?in a nutshell, the movie is good if you want to see lector and starling once again but, if you're going for a really good thriller... you'll jump once and be grossed out maybe twice. depends on your level.thinking about how much money this movie will bring in... there will probably be another "hannibal" made and this movie probably won't be on video until the fall. if you must see it.. wait and save the $3.50 - $4.00 and get it on video. don't spend the big bucks on this film.

i completely understand why this movie was made. silence of the lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....what i don't understand is why this movie was made... and why anthony hopkins agreed to reprise his role as hannibal the cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.there's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, don't read on. the film is absolutely horrible. it's so bad that the transition from jodie foster to julianne moore becomes a non-issue. the only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film, because up until that point, it's quite an interesting thriller. the reparte between moore and hopkins is comparable to hopkins and foster, and the performances by the other characters are pretty good. but literally at the two hour mark, the film degrades into nothing but a cheesy d-grade horror flick...it's sick, and it's stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time, and threw together an ending in one day of filming.initial buzz over the thomas harris' book's unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director ridley scott to order a re-write... and, honestly, having seen the film and read the book's finale, i don't know which is worse.please - don't waste your money or time on this film, unless you're prepared to leave exactly at the two hour point, because that's the only way you'll feel satisfied about the saga of clarice starling and hannibal lecter... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and the wait for this one, so great.

i'm a big fan of thomas harris,i read all his novels at least 5 times and hannibal's the book i really love the most.therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and i really don't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten.either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both.even if i hadn't read the book i'd still consider the movie as absolute average and i'd give it a five. the creepy,mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie,when i saw it first in the cinema i even fell asleep.why was margot verger, a very important character, totally omitted? why was barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money? and most of all, why was the psychological process starling went through in the end,caused by the drugs lecter applied to her,descended? not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted,too,and totally changed? well, the reasons why jodie foster refused to play starling again are well known and i accepted it,although like surely many others i'm very disappointed 'cause i identified starling with her.for stories like red dragon,the silence of the lambs or hannibal that possess such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen,but as the germans say, that's "snow of yesterday". ridley scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name. jonathan demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships towards each other in the silence of the lambs, he should have done hannibal,too.my only comfort is that i've seen the movie only two times,it's long ago and thank god for that reason i'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when i read the novel. i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone.

one of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. anthony hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. i can't believe david mamet and ridley scott's name appear on this travesty. the best career move jody foster ever made was turning this one down. julianne moore was as emotionless throughout as a female keanu reeves. gary oldman was of course, his brilliant self. he is a crippled victim of hannibal and the make-up is so good, i didn't know it was gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars??? give me a break! rumor has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits. and frying and feeding his own brain to ray liotta...i was laughing at the absurdity, no make that stupidity of this flick at this point. i haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie since who's that girl.pay someone else to go for you if you must, but miss this one at all cost!!!

imagination must of slipped jim wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one. i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far. i did enjoy seeing jay richardson and glori ann gilbert get eaten. gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits (my husbands sentiments). jerri manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy. at least we know the next plot giant snake man slays komodo before becoming daddy to a nest of eggs. jerri would be great as the mother cobra. sit back with a 6 pact or a couple of joints. it will ease the pain.

within the first 5 minutes of this movie i knew i was in for one of those "pick at the faults" kinda movie. the acting was terrible, the script was even worse. who ever let these people write write such crap for a movie need to be feed the komodo's themselves. with russian mig jets posing as u.s. air force jets, and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 - 60 rounds rapid fire without reloading is poor detail to any story. in one scene komodo are killing special forces troops at night, while in another they are explaining how the komodos and cobras are cold blooded and don't come out night!!!! also with fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry, they were only average even for this low budget movie.all that being said, i did watch it to the end curious as to what other wonders bad film making could produce. shame shame shame, for producing such rot!!!this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor!!!

"scientists at a remote lab experiment on (insert scaly creature here) and create out of control monsters. in the meantime a crack military team/the scientist's daughter/bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters. one by one they're eaten, all during an "exciting" race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters..." the sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the sci-fi channel. i have to wonder just what is going on? sure... i like bimbos and hollywood-hunk wannabes be eaten by cgi critters as much as the next person... but where's the plot or originality? granted, there are times when sci-fi channel shines. battlestar galactica, if a bit dark, can be very good. writers have continued to pump life into the various stargate offerings, and the latest bbc import of doctor who is surprisingly good.even in the various "giant animal" movies on sci-fi, the animation seems to be getting better all the time. compare the kommodo in this film to the rather clunky version in the first giant kommodo film on sci-fi.but goodness... how about a different plot? maybe some -different- giant critter? on a whim, i started searching around the internet. among the litter i found a few interesting stories which might appeal to sf fans and out of work russian cgi animators at once. i offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights. (the story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various sci-fi channel offerings).the story has subplot, ethical and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible "did they really kill all the monsters???" moments, but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindset.which is generally what science-fiction is supposed to do, no?

bad, bad, movie, so bad it is worth watching. as long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. the special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny. if your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her? if she did get eaten wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart out? this guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. how anti-climatic is that? maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something. he does join his sister in the komodo's belly - oh didn't mean to spoil it for you.

i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. the acting is ridiculous. half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen. i think there are puppet shows with more believability. they can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold. if asked to summarise the movie, i would say that someone had rustled up a group of complete no-hopers at the local county-fair, slapped them on an island, added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing.i can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released, recorded on dvd and costs $6 from my local video store for one day. if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film.i hate this movie with great intensity. why? i wish i knew captain, i wish i knew....

****spoiler alert**** my boyfriend, some friends, and i rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. we sort of knew what we were getting into. but the lack of plot, direction, and special effects actually left us hoping for a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (that ate people like scooping ice cream)... we sort of get this in the end, but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints? its one redeeming quality is that its laughably bad, with many salient details pointed out by other readers. i recommend this movie if your into cutting onions to make yourself cry.

a team of amateur journalists and tree-huggers catches wind of a secret government project, project carnivore, on a remote south pacific island. the scientists there are producing giant-sized corn, but the genes are spreading to other species, creating abnormally large komodo dragons and a cobra (one that's bullet-proof and swims underwater). with the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape the island and tell the world? even if i hadn't seen this film on the sci-fi channel (which, sadly, i did) it would scream "sci-fi channel" with its low production value, weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history. the effects here are comparable to another creature film, "raptor island", although not nearly as bad. i would suspect that there must be at least a handful of people that worked on both films, but i haven't bothered to confirm that and probably won't. it will be a sad day when i see either of them films again.which is not to say it's not enjoyable. i watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and i can't speak for him, but i thought it was a pretty good use of time. as bad the whole thing is, it's a fun picture if you like to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to carry the film (i believe the actress' name is michelle borth). michael pare also appears as a ship captain, and his poor choice of roles here actually makes his work on "furnace" look respectable (even if that movie is intolerably bad).i can't be too hard on this film simply because it was more or less exactly what i thought it would be. bad effects? low budget? no-name actors? i didn't have any higher hopes. yet, this doesn't mean that it's awesome, either. coming in at par is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory department. for the one fan who likes this film (and calls it "kvc"), hold on to your copy because you'll have a heck of a time getting a replacement.

i can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. and that is not saying a little, because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. but this is beyond bad. this movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad.reviewing this is almost impossible. there are no strong points and nothing positive to say. i'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked. first off, the cgi has to be one of the worst i've seen. i can't believe this movie was made in 2005, the cgi reminds me of something i might have seen in babylon 5 way back when cgi was new and fresh. it's poor beyond belief. second, the actors all seem like they belong in the worst kind of daytime soaps. and looking at their resumes i see that i'm correct... thirdly, being able to breed enormous reptiles is no match to the other technology they invented in this movie: the recoilless pistol with infinite ammo! seriously, michael paré fires 100-200 times without reloading in every other scene... as if that was not enough there are also shape-shifting planes! at first they are regular f-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something else completely, and in the third scene they are f-16 again! if you're buying stock footage, please don't mix it like this! honestly, there is loads more to say, but i think i'll stop. you all understand what i'm saying. honestly i didn't think this kind of movie was made any more. it's like something ed wood would do. completely ignorant of quality, not caring how anything looks... it's almost amazing in all it's awfulness. if i could give it 0/10 i would, but 1/10 is the lowest grade. so that's it.

i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes. it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments. what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief. i was even more shocked to see people appraising the film in the comments section of this site. this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever. the people behind this should be bought to justice asap. today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child. even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing,nauseating indeed.

just watched this "film" and it actually made me want to write my first comment on imdb.com, even though i've been a user for more than 9 years. the reason that i watched this, is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my limits and see what actually still shocks me. first of all, the gore in this film didn't shock me, not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film - what really shocked me, is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap. don't get me wrong - i'm all against censorship, but this film seems to me like it was made for some kind of fetish crowd that seems to get off on this type of sh*t.it didn't give you that same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching films like "august underground". that film is terrible to watch, but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is. in the case of "niku daruma", it seems like it was made strictly to arouse people. i prefer films that shock, because they are well done and thought through, like gaspar noe's films, or takashi miike's, or funny games or man bites dog - those films will stick with you for a while. this film i will have forgotten by tomorrow, and the only thing that will stick with me, is the thought, that somewhere out there, there are people getting aroused by watching this sh*t. if you read this, please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself - this of course does not apply to gore hounds, who just love splatter. you're cool! peace

not near as well made as the "guinea pig" flicks it was inspired by ("flowers of flesh and blood" or "devil's experiment") and not conveying any real philosophy, this video feature, which is barely feature length, adds hardcore sex (with mosaic censoring) to its inspiration. the special make-up effects, which include stomach slitting and disembowelment, are pretty good, if overlit. the amateur feel of the production is a distraction. it all looks cheap and lazy. the lighting is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy. the simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie. just when she gets tired of being abused, the real abuse begins. in the film's hero scene, an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in graphic close-up, stuffs his member inside it, and proceeds to do his thing. i didn't find "psycho - the snuff reels" shocking. on the contrary, i found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to one-up "guinea pig" and its bloody ilk. interestingly, this was distributed by aroma, a leading fetish producer.

this movie just didn't do it for me. i like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror. the effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake. the same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex. they could have spent of few extra bucks on the effects.with lots of sex (with pixelization as in all japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this. while bloodier, for me it fits in with titles like squirmfest / purge and the genki series. these movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body, eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals, like toads, eels and... one look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere. no horror here,just sick and degrading sex scenes.horror fans should avoid this one and are better of checking out guinea pig2: flowers of flesh and blood or even august underground mordum. while these are not great they at least offer a horror experience and niku daruma absolutely fails in that department.

frankie muniz plays jason who is a high school student. his biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times. however, he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline. while he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher, he crushes into a car. as he explains the situation to grumpy man(giamatti) in the car, he gives him a lift to his school. but the problem is jason leaves his homework in the car, the other way of saying this is marty wolf(giamatti) steals it.after a few months jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback. because the story of the movie is based on his homework. he tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him. especially his father uses words which insults him. jason decides to go to la and find wolf to tell his father that jason is not a liar. when wolf refuses it, jason takes action and ruins his life.this is the short story of the big fat liar. well, as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible. such as, having such a small amount of money and going to la with a friend to sort the problem out, having access to this cinema producer's highly protected house and office, setting up a telecommunications system overnight.does it seem believable? it does not. well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gullible.big fat liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience. unfortunately, i am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie. ** out of *****

i suppose i can see why critics give this film two out five stars, it isn't fantastic, but i think it is worth a look, from director shawn levy (cheaper by the dozen, night at the museum). basically 14-year-old jason shepherd (malcolm in the middle's frankie muniz) is often lying to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing, he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer. so he completes his work, but getting a lift from hollywood producer marty wolf (paul giamatti), who hit him on the way to school, he manages to leave his paper with the story "big fat liar" in the car. he finds out from a movie trailer that marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie, so he and his best friend kaylee (she's the man's amanda bynes) are on a mission to prove jason is for once telling the truth. marty of course is too nasty and smug to give jason's father harry (michael bryan french) a phone call, and he evens burns the "big fat liar" paper. so now jason and kaylee are determined to make marty's life as hellish as possible, until he agrees to call jason's dad. they put blue dye in his swimming pool, and orange hair dye in his shampoo, and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for marty's career. there is the obvious point when jason looks like he wants to give up, but don't worry, all characters that despise marty help out in the final operation, and with jason's parents coming, he wants to finally prove his truthfulness, and boy does he deliver, big style. also starring amanda detmer as monty kirkham, lee majors as vince, donald adeosun faison as frank jackson, sandra oh as mrs. phyllis caldwell, russell hornsby as marcus duncan, christine tucci as carol shepherd and american pie's john cho as dustin 'dusty' wong. muniz is likable, byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support, and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little, giamatti is great at being nasty. it is a kids film, so if it seems corny, cheesy or predictable, just keep that in mind, and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick. okay!

shakespeare would have been outraged. the writers mutilated shakespeare's amazing work. ariel is the only believable acting performance. the african voodoo, secluded swamp, and "gator man" character make the movie a mockery of shakespeare's true tempest. don't waste your eye-sight on this movie.

i keep waiting for peter fonda to start acting. for someone who comes from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me why peter fonda can only play peter fonda trying to play someone else. and, that's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of the tempest. a string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the bard's great play is what we're served. the setting is the civil war and prospero's (here guideon's) evil brother looks like an 1890's melodrama villain, complete with snidely whiplash moustache. i kept waiting for him to go "uh ha hah!" which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation. none of the supporting cast was memoriable and peter fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on. the tempest is the bard's statement about the rage of man's unjust treatment of man. the only believable character was the gator man, the caliban counterpart. the transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the civil war setting just didn't make it. all in all, a very disappointing production. i saw it on video and would advise, if you want a willy shakespeare fix, save your money on this one. rent something else, like branagh's much ado about nothing, or kevin kline in midsummer's night dream.

bette midler is the best thing about this movie. it is a poor second to the original from 1962 with natalie wood as gypsy. the songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better. bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to cynthia gibb. only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie.there was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl. when natalie wood was gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. when she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant, it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star, not just a poor substitute to her sister. and the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through. it was an important part of the movie and they butchered it. it is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. it was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie. i was completely disappointed and had it not been for bette midler i would have shut the movie off.

this attempt at a "thriller" would have no substance at all! some may state that this movie "has it all?" autism, arson, robbery, lost love, a bag of money, cut throats, murder, blood, a snub nosed revolver, clenched teeth groaning, boobs (various definitions can be used), large flashlights, tribal people, a brother duo attempting to out-portray "dumb and dumber," white wolves, fight scenes that resemble "happy slapping," snow mobile(s), a large tracked vehicle, and a motel under renovation? all this, with an "enyanesque" melody toward the end ...perhaps my rating is a bit harsh, but one viewing will certainly be enough for the sane cinemaphile with nothing else to do. yeowza!

put the film down and back slowly away. the acting rivals a highschool play, the plot is treadworn, and the production values are slightly higher than community theater. the goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher. rooms are switched around, the dead move, dogs are used for wolves, men shot point blank with .45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles, blouses button and unbutton without human touch... this is a baaaaaaaaaddddddd movie. i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating. there is no accounting for taste. btw, there is no nudity.

i saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late-night 80's sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning. i must say, i didn't expect much, and i didn't get much. although rose mcgowan is hot, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscar-worthy, to say the least. this movie has its ups and downs, and does have a nice couple of twists at the end, but in all honesty it was awful. not even a typical slasher movie. no gore, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. just bad acting. i'd give it a 3 out of 10.

after a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman jason (adam beach) comes to the diner of his friend fritz (jurgen prochnow) and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day. among the weird strangers, jason meets his former sweetheart nancy (rose mcgowan), who has just left her husband in los angeles. along the night, without any communication with his base, jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients, and finds some corpses, indicating that among them there is a killer."the last stop" could be an average thriller, but the screenplay is simply awful. most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed, and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests. my vote is four.title (brazil): "encurralados" ("trapped")

after starting watching the re-runs of old columbo movies, i thought they would all get about the same vote from me (6). but apparently i'm now starting to see differences in the movies. it happened in some of just previous episodes, that showed some pretty genius directing, and it shows in this one, but in the negative way.the movie was so boring, that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a columbo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away. the directing seems too pretentious. the scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace. and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode. then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.some applause should be given to the "prelude" however. in this episode, a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc. i really liked that. but alas, no focus on how columbo reveals all this. and the "proof" that in the end leaves columbo victorious is the silliest ever.rating: lies between 4 and 5

i am a big fan of the abc movies of the week genre. i am only 27, meaning i wasn't even born until after the series ended, but i am trying to collect as many of them on dvd as possible. i have about a dozen or so. i had read such wonderful things about this film, both on here and elsewhere, that i was really excited to see it. i just received my dvd in the mail today and watched it anxiously. i'll admit that the first one or two phone calls did give me the creeps - that boy's voice would give anyone the creeps! but it began to ware off fast and the entire divorce subplot was stupid. i also figured out that michael douglas was the antagonist about a half an hour before the movie ended. as soon as that story was told about how elizabeth ashley's character had locked up his mother, i knew something was fishy. plus, didn't anyone ever think to ask him why he happened to suddenly appear that night when the fire occurred in the barn? i'll admit that i thought he was coaching a boy at the school to make the phone calls. i didn't guess the mute boy part or the pre-recorded tapes (did they ever say whose voice that actually was? i doubt douglas could ever get his voice that high?).i am only giving this movie a four out of ten because i actually liked most of the acting in it. ashley especially is great.it's a shame, because this movie has such a great premise, but oh well, thats what happens sometimes when one gets his or her hopes up for a movie too much.

i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seen.and to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shop,my reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me again?i doubt it,they always say don't judge something by its cover,they were right when i saw the cover to skins/gang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars.don't watch this film.i can't think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad.

wings hauser and son, cole hauser team up to make a film about neo-nazi thugs targeting a gay man, and terrorising a city. wings plays the hero, and his real-life son is the villain. fairly low-budget film that has not many redeeming features, and for some reason, no one has seen it! perhaps because it is quite a laughable and ridiculous film, and the studio realised this! maybe wings hauser himself prevented the distribution of 'skins', after seeing it himself! maybe people just didn't want to comment on such a bad film! oh well! i generally like wings and cole as actors, but this was a film that they both should have skipped. wings directed, wrote and was the lead actor in 'skins'! an extremely bad and stupid film! 1/2 out of *****!

it is beyond me why two million danish people each week sit down to watch this terrible show. the dialogue is terrible and not realistic. the characters are hollow and simplistic. there's a tough man, a tough woman and a sensitive man. the writers actually say that they have modeled the characters after greek mythology! give me a break! all the characters are of course brilliant policemen. when i have watched this show i have longed for "district hill street" and "nypd blue". these are brilliant shows, and "rejseholdet" is a lousy copy. this program is a symptom of the disease danish television is currently suffering from.

ok, what was this story about again? i am afraid that i never read the book and frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies that i have ever tried to watch in a long time. i get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumbs. the film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together.after recently seeing the "pride and prejudice" movie with colin firth, i have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his, and bluntly, other than "what a girl wants" i am not finding much where he played in that was any good. i am definitely not saying that he wasn't good. he is really one of the best actors i have seen in the modern day film, but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired."the english patient" is another perfect example of where the director, writer, and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture  literally. the entire movie seemed to be to showcase ralph fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting that was a bore. nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation! kristin scott thomas' character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and titillating other men other than her husband; colin firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent  i guess; and ralph fiennes walks around like a roman mr. darcy (sorry, colin!) who thinks he knows it all. the rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) to the four winds as the plot wanders on.the subplot of the mental stability of the nurse (juliette binoche) and her motives and involvement with naveen andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unsavory taste. but of course, the viewer is still reeling how in the world the first two characters (thomas and fiennes) ended up having sex the first time anyway. what was the attraction? there was no chemistry and no build-up. just a slap, bam, thank you! and isn't it romantic that fiennes ended up a traitor helping the germans by giving them maps to the desert? (sarcasm) to describe this movie, i would have to simply say, "how to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet, adorable husband who loves you." the final unbelievable section of this plot is to fathom how anyone would choose ralph fiennes over colin firth. firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents  in fact, when watching the movie, i thought it must have been one of his first. the scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie. at that, i have no interest in watching it again.the best scene i liked was the plane crash where firth is trying to take them all out. too bad he missed! it would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. aerial desert scenes were pretty neat, though.

i am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense, such as that this film "[proves] that when it is predestined, love will find a way." i begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film, even before it hit the theaters. even the best of films do not "prove" anything, nor are they intended to. the best films entertain and move the viewer, and "the english patient" fails on both criteria.i remember the studio's promotion of "the english patient" very clearly: "from the producers of 'amadeus' and 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest,'" it grandly announced. an ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word, "producers," in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of "the english patient," so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, milos forman. such a comparison is offensive to the memory of mr. forman.while the novel by michael ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever. aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel.despite misgivings which began when i heard that shamelessly misleading promotion, i went to see this film in the theater. as it began to unfold, i realized that the rendering of the novel's peculiar magic had failed, that the actors knew their words but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dull, and unengaging. the film was a complete travesty of ondaatje's novel and a completely still-born cinematic artifact of the worst description.those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like, "sweeping," and "grand," and "hypnotic." well, it is none of those. in fact, not even ondaatje's fine novel could be described as "sweeping" or "grand." it could be described as "magical" and "hypnotic" -- yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver. it is almost as if minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters. he produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.minghella took the central focus away from hana and kip and put it on the patient and katherine clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the "essence" of it.ralph fiennes and kristen scott thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by minghella's grandiose and overblown presentation.the "grand, sweeping, david-lean-like" qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. the comparison to david lean ("dr. zhivago") is positively insulting to yet another great director. take, for example, the "patient's" sandstorm scene, which is no doubt one wherein these "grand, sweeping" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing. the subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm, which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, completely lacked either drama or emotion --in fact, because it was so patently weak, it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.this film failed. it failed as a rendering of the novel, and it failed as a film. it seems to have been the "anointed oscar vehicle" of the year (joining such over-trumpeted filmic slosh as "kramer vs. kramer" or "terms of endearment"). one can only thank god that even the hype-driven acadamyhad the good sense to present the best actress award to frances mcdormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film, "fargo." there was not a single performance in the execrable "english patient" that was not either embarrassingly horrid over-acting (willem dafoe) or truly forgettable, mediocre acting (fiennes and scott thomas).why this non-entity of a film retains a coven of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) devotees will remain a mystery. fortunately, the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently, and it will not, thankfully, have the strength ever to dig itself out.

this is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people, one of whom is married to someone else. it ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever, and i'm a die hard romantic. my husband opted out after the first hour of its three, by which time little had transpired. the desert scenery is spectacular, with the endless sand and the sunshine on katharine's golden hair. however, cinematography does not a brilliant film make, unless it's a national geographic travelogue. the magnificent saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig.the movie revolves around a badly burned, dying pilot named count laszlo de almasy, who is left in the care of a canadian army nurse, hana, during world war ii italy. he appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession, his story is very slowly revealed, with the help of a man from his past named caravaggio, who mysteriously appears at his deathbed. almasy was a hungarian cartographer employed by the royal geographical society to chart the sahara desert. he entered into an affair with the wife, katherine, of a fellow explorer who proved to be a british spy. meanwhile in the present, laszlo's nurse has her own affair with a sikh nicknamed kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines.my quarrels with this movie are many, length and tedium for starters. i don't fault the acting in particular, it simply isn't a good story. caravaggio seems unnecessary, his connection to almasy sketchy. he provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film.the core problem is that the two parties of this affair, almasy and katharine, are woefully unsympathetic characters, shallow and dull. they simply aren't very nice, thus there is no one to cheer for. almasy is cool, aloof, haughty, and eventually disgustingly possessive of another man's wife. katharine is likewise detached and nasty, not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husband...apart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies. this is a tale of lust rather than love, with such pearls as 'i can still taste you'. almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation in his beloved's neck, surely more indicative of a focus on katharine's body. the victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband, geoffrey, who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance. it's all quite sordid and disgusting, katharine's charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion, all as silent night is being sung in the background. i'm not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carol's purity with their selfish lust, but i definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone. we have full frontal nudity with katharine, but their sex scenes come across as cold, selfish, lustful, and sometimes downright hateful...not warm, loving, giving, nor even truly passionate. if either of these two feels any emotion for the other, it is a totally selfish one and definitely not love, as i define the word.almasy's return to the cave of the swimmers to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving. katharine must have expired only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears dozing, not at all corpse like. of course this is all for dramatic effect, as the romantics watching this tale (normally i'd be one of them) would not appreciate a decaying, putrid corpse. in order to retrieve his adulterous lover's body, he has betrayed his comrades & the allies by giving his maps to the nazis, the english being cast as the villains of the piece. regardless of whether or not he's keeping his final promise to katharine, his traitorous act is not something i admire much. kip seems a pleasant fellow and hana generally likable, but their romance is not in the least engaging, merely a brief wartime fling with the parties indicating little trauma upon parting. moving back and forth between the two settings (past sahara desert and present italy) proved distracting and unpleasant but really, both stories were dull as dishwater. the only spark of interest in the whole picture was kip's tense mine disarming scene.not being totally heartless, i did have some sympathy for the current almasy's severely burned and dying state. however, perhaps my major complaint with this film is the euthanasia at the end when hana obliges her patient by giving him a morphine overdose. we are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for almasy, cries while she is preparing the deadly syringe, and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate herodotus book to console him as he's dying. the amazing director david lean's masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic, immoral tale. yes, lawrence of arabia also has a desert, but in lean films (doctor zhivago, brief encounter), those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters exhibiting admirable restraint, guilt, and some regard for the betrayed spouse, as opposed to the total self absorption of this pair. in ryan's daughter, the cuckold husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness. this movie is a supposedly intellectual, enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story. its best picture oscar does not speak well for the academy. for those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie, the answer is simple. it's awful.

i caught this on cinemax very late at night...nothing else was on so i pretty much had no choice. bottom line, terrible plot, slow, waste of good film and actors' time. to make it short, don't even bother with this one. it's too bad we can't give zeros as a rating; this one really is not worth even a consideration!!!

not only that the vhs and dvd cover(at least in europe)show a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie, the acting is so bad, that the movie is crying out for being made fun of. if you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to have some laughs about a movie, that is supposed to be serious, watch tycus and peter onorati, a man who will teach you how to knock over bad guys with empty carton boxes! shame on dennis hopper, following travoltas example by starring in his very own "battlefield earth". for those who want to watch a good movie about the earth being destroyed by a terrible force, please do not choose tycus, but do yourselves a favor and watch "armageddon" for he 20th time!

this is complete crap do not watch the main character is so f u c king concerned that the doc's bomb shelter is not big enough for everyone thus he claims the doc is playing god by saying who lives and who dies all during his 13itching, he kills people without thinking twice and beats people to near death also, the main character is an selfish little a$$ wipe as because of him, the doc who made the shelter died and his friend died. he also killed several no name cops the main character is just a f u c king dumb hillbilly s h i t head that's got no concept of the greater good also, this movie makes no f u c king sense. tell me why a comet would cause seismic activity? (if you say gravity, i will f u c king rape you cause the comet is smaller then the moon and you don't see the moon causing volcano eruptions and earthquakes and avalanches).why does a comet cause atmospheric discharges (the red lightning, also why is it red?) in addition, if you don't know, the f u c king moons been hit by comets thousands of times!!! thats why there's f u c king craters everywhere on the moon. the size of an object needed to shatter the moon into the fragments as portrayed in the movie would require a comet around the size of the moon itself.it takes huge amounts of ke to cause an satellite to explode like that.a goof in this movie is that the nuclear explosion in space resulted in a disk shaped shock wave. this is incorrect as in space, the explosion should have produced an spherical shock wave. this inaccuracy is also apparent when the comet hits the moon.also, someone tell me why the commander (the person who drives the big old broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die? i mean he's just like walking with them to the shelter, then he stops, he salutes the main character.wtf?!?!!?!? the main character is also an ugly @$$hole, he's got a huge forehead and thinning hair. disgusting.stay away from this movie!!!

peter crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. but when the government doesn't believe him (dumb fact #1). he builds a shelter in deep underground and is drawing lots to see who will go. plus is willing to kill to save humanity (dumb fact #2). with millions of dollars of technology, how could a civilian see what nasa could not? plus, the ends justifies the means moral of this story is just plain wrong!!! this movie is improbable and totally unbelievable. what was running through these people minds, why the hell do crap piles like this get the green light? some times i wonder who someone has to **** to get a movie made in this ****ing town.

like many others, i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time. i was sadly mistaken. everything negative said about this flic is more than true. what takes the cake however, is the horrible, horrible storyline for the main character.here's why: the planet might be destroyed, the only way to recover from it, for the entire human race to be saved trough it, is to get as many smart, capable, nice, competent people into an underground hide-out. and dennis hopper is the lone seer/scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst, and who has realized this. but what's the main motivation of stevens (sonny d'angelo)?? he's angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! while it clearly explained to stevens that dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. the hopper-character was the boy with the finger in the dike, and now stevens is blaming him for 'picking and choosing'??? and if that isn't enough, he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout, because "it isn't fair!?" and.... he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity's saviour! oh my god, how stupid can you get?what's also maddening that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap. i mean, two million in budget, what could have been done with that? think clerks, blair witch, and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100.000 dollars and were still better. aaaaargh! i count myself lucky that i didn't pay one penny to see this crap, and to sit through the end of this utter, úber-crap, is one the most heroic things i've done this year. it's no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...

not only did the effects and acting in this movie bite, but the story was terrible.a scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... then, everyone is upset that he is "playing god".how lame! he built the thing, why is everyone "entitled" to access? totally lame story, don't waste your time!

i found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed.basically, dr. crawford (dennis hopper) has predicted a meteor will hit the earth. the "powers that be" don't believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people.jake lowe (peter onorati) is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains. he sets out to investigate.while trying to get into the secret survival shelter jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives. he spends the rest of his time bitching at dr. crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor.i found myself wishing jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself.don't waste your time on this turkey.

this is a disaster-movie, in both meanings of the word. every character, every role, every conversation, every twist, everything in this movie stinks big time. it's a shame to see dennis hopper's talent wasted in this dreadful movie. i can give you 100's of examples but see for yourself.or rather : don't.

horrendous! i'm a teenager and i don't mind teen movies but this is horrible! aaron carter plays this popstar named jd mcqueen and to keep his grades up or something, he works together with the 'nerd', jane whateverherlastnameis. but the 'mean girls' are too predictable and such the clothing most of the girls wear in the movie isn't realistic. how would any of those girls get away with wearing no bra, tube tops and shirts that expose the belly? in high school? at my school, we'd be sent home for something like that.and one part of the movie where jd texts jane, she says 'sleep tight? he must think i'm an idiot! i didn't know texting was so stressful!' how is texting stressful? and how obsessed jane is with jd and how he 'falls' in love with her is very stupid. the dialogue is cheesy and stupid, the acting's terrible. the music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is little to none.for tweeny-boppers who still love aaron carter, you'll enjoy it. if you're a casual watcher like me, this is not the movie for you

honestly, the only reason i picked up this movie from blockbuster was because aaron carter was in it. okay first thing's first. do you notice how ugly aaron carter has become?? i mean, he used to be so cute but now..with that lanky body and blotchy skin - ew. i think he should stick with singing and the directors of the movie could've found a much better-looking guy who could lip-sync. no offense though. i thought this teen movie was majorly lame - and this is coming from me, being a teen myself. the 'mean girls' in there are oh-so predictable, the acting is so amateurish it makes you cringe at times (especially from aaron) and overall i just didn't enjoy it. although, i give out points for the storyline - that was alright, but not at all realistic. anyway, stay away from this movie by all means you can unless you happen to have wads of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. it's not worth the $6.50!!(p.s; this review of mine may not be applicable to younger kids under the age of 13!)

i rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. we actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes. unfortunately, i don't remember the first half of the movie because all i did was stare at the giant metal braces jane wore. and i didn't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp. the other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense. this movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes. if you remember the days when aaron carter was considered a "popstar" and you like high waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee length skirts, then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you.

what really stood out to me about this movie was how little the plot made sense. so many characters were randomly introduced, it was like how i imagine tommy wiseau's "the room" would be re-envisioned for the disney channel set. we had the wise elderly couple who kept on hanging out where "jane" worked, telling the same story about how "soda" brought them together, or jane's mom/stepmom/random crying woman who would all show up at random times.aaron carter's acting is definitely the highlight of this film: i actually looked forward to every scene he appeared in. the editing is painfully bad, with scene cuts that make no sense. the "jane" character is really irritating, mooning about and moping about "j.d. mcqueen." the scenes with the "music awards" are more depressing than anything else. and the ending of this movie is surreal.

worst. movie. ever made. ever. i have no words to say about it.. other then it truly had no point, no plot, no... anything. sheer crap!!! i don't know how everyone in the movie didn't shoot them shelves after watching it.... .... .... ... .. i love vampire flicks and mysteries, and alternate abstract outside the box films, and.... this was non of those. i mean what the crap!!! i cant even tell you what the film was about cuz i still don't know, and i just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it... bottom line.. i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs. thats the only thing i got from this film. please don't watch this... i mean for a " sultry sensual vampire flick" there wasn't even the to be expected nudity you'd get from a vamp flick. anyway back to my point.... this movie blows. go set yourself on fire instead.... .. ..

pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera gone goth about a drug that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures lurk. the film has some good imagery but its odd mix of whats real and whats not doesn't go anywhere. worse are the vague pronouncements in voice over from one of the characters. it seems to herald a more serious, more meaningful film, but i don't think they even got into the serious or meaningful territory to begin with so trying to over sell the meaning comes off silly. there isn't a great deal to say, people talk, take drugs have visions...they talks some more. its not bad so much as pointless and dull. the dull is the sin here and the reason you'll want to avoid this.

bled starts as young female artist sai (sarah ferooqui) meets a mysterious yet charming man named renfield (jonathan oldham) & they end up back at her studio apartment where he gives her the bark of some sort of tree which is used as a hallucinogenic drug when melted down. sai quickly becomes hooked as she is whisked into an alternate fantasy reality which involve vampiric creatures. sai's photographer friend royce (chris ivan cevic) becomes concerned about her as she drifts further from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug, can royce her kick the drug or will it end up ruining her life & why did the mysterious renfield get her addicted to the stuff in the first place & do the elaborate fantasy dream like trips have any significance?co-produced & directed by christopher hutson this anaemic arty vampire flick is pretty much 95 minutes of tedium & is throughly deserving of all the bad comments. the script was written by the interestingly named sxv'leithan essex (how the hell do you even pronounce that anyway?) who is also credited as production designer & his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in bled, i would guess that the makers set out to make a very serious fantasy based horror film with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction & date rape drug at it's core. the majority of the film is spent on the drug issue with sai's initial introduction to the drug, how great the first time was & how she becomes hopelessly addicted which eventually destroys her, her life & her friends lives. it's never explained where she keeps getting this drug from as renfield only gives her a little bit during their initial meeting but hey, who cares? the first twenty odd minutes of bled are really boring & dull, the following hour or so aren't much better before a mess of a final ten minutes which involve a vampiric monster & renfield making a reappearance. the moral elements are patronising, the fantasy elements seem like an afterthought & the horror is none existent. there's also the dialogue which is awful, every sentence tries to be profound, have loads of hidden depth & just tries to have so much meaning that it becomes tiresome to listen to.the concept of the film is terrible & so is the execution as there's absolutely no gore or violence to speak of & the entire thing is set inside an apartment that doesn't appear to have any lights. the fantasy setting looks a little better but it's sparsely seen & underused. there are no scares here, no atmosphere & to make matters even worse the makers have decided to used muted very faded colours which i just hate & find annoying, what's wrong with a nice colourful image? it seems to me to be a fad with current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a film cool or adds atmosphere which it most certainly doesn't, more often than not it just makes your film look dull & drab as evidenced here with bled.this probably had a low budget & was shot in los angeles & it has reasonable production values but it's all so dull. the acting didn't impress me, i didn't care for or about anyone which is never a good sign.bled is a terrible vampire film that goes for psychological horror as well as physical with all sorts of parallels to real life dug addiction & what it can do to little or no effect because the whole thing is so dull. there might be an audience for a film such as this but considering the other comments not that big a one.

what on earth? like watching an episode of neighbours after drinking two bottles of cough medicine- nightmarish and making no sense at all. i was waiting for the clever part where everything fits into place and saves the film. maybe it was there and i just missed it, or was lost on me.my strongest suspicion is that it is a thinly veiled attempt to market a new drug thats about to hit the streets. i wouldn't say "don't watch it" but i will say its pretty poor on every level- like am dram in high def. whack. unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. then it's just dandy.

simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah & am also giving these 4 stars just because of her,on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. theacting was horrible. the script was uninspired. this was a movie that kept contradicting itself. the film was sloppy and unoriginal. its not like i was expecting a good film. just something to give me a jump or two. this did not even do that. he worst thing is that, the more i think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding. a real shame really, as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere...i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4/10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent, this film really should have delivered far more.

i rented this movie today... worst movie ever. it was a total waste of time and a horrible story. the acting was horrible, especially by the actress of "sai". she was so bad it was ridiculous. i can't tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just that stupid in the first place. i can't even get my mind wrapped around just how awful and pointless this whole movie was. i'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to release it.if you're looking for a good vampire/horror flick.. this is not the movie for you. move right along! it's a waste of time and money. heck, i wouldn't even download this movie if someone paid me.this movie is so bad it doesn't even deserve a "1". i wish i could give it a "0"!

it's the best film that takes the first place at the sickest and an useful films ever made in this poor country. really u people even don't know what the word cinema means and u cast votes for movies, i'm really curious to know how many movies of p.p.p. or l.bunuel have u seen. the score of this "faield experiment" it reflects a lot of u're way of understanding things and to recognize a good/quality movie when u see it. we the romanian people have only one movie and until this day the status hasn't change & that movie is "padurea spanzuratilor". but i don't lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it. that is a movie that respects all the required quality's's of an movie. from the script to the frames and even to the quality/clarity of the picture even are past over him 41 years. i recommend to the voters to search for better movies and then vote. kudos will see u later .

i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'gone with the wind' should ever have been undertaken. having expressed that, i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood. i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe.

...but not this one! i always wanted to know "what happened" next. we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret's baby. i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie. i did compare "scarlett" to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first. rhett was cast beautifully, although no one will ever compare to mr. gable. i am also a strict vivien leigh fan!! she was scarlett. she fit the bill. not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with "scarlett" the job could have been done better. not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett, that was evident.overall, something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett, i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction. this movie is not worth the time.

as an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

i've read the book 'scarlett' and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it. i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed. the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like. one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed. it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. a fine movie, but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was, had it more true to alexandra rippley's book.

as everyone knows, nobody can play scarlett o'hara like vivien leigh, and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable. all others pale in comparison, and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions. one thing that i really couldn't get past was that joanne has brown eyes. the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she has been stripped of those.the movie, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. the new characters weren't all that memorable, and i found myself forgetting who was who. i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. it could be that i'm only 11, but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say, 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up. if rhett hadn't told her that, i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude. she really loved cat, her baby. she likes this child best because she had it with rhett, her only loved husband. still, if you've read gone with the wind, you would see that children make no difference in scarlett's world. quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett. all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together, and scarlett took way too long to get to that. it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind, but then again what isn't? if you have read the novel, you will like that better than the movie.i would watch it, just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind, regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile. it may not satisfy you entirely, but it will get you some of the way there.

if you really loved gwtw, you will find quite disappointing the story. those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south, will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production (altought i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett). but, let me say that considering the novel, nothing good could came out of this.i've read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs. mitchell did for the film. it took me some time to understand how good the ending was: scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett, since she always got what she wanted. but there was no kiss in the end.then alexandra ripley came to "fix" this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be, and of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could have been further from mrs. mitchell mind, i am sure).the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends, showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending.if margaret mitchell could came to live again, she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after gwtw.sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault. isn't it? is it any good if i don't compare it to the original? maybe. sorry to say i don't really care.i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's (suberb) work, otherwise don't even try.

shwaas may have a good story, but the director is utterly devoid of talent. he does not know when to stop. when the story calls for people to act confused, there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion. when the story calls for a little background history, there are ten minute scenes of konkan's greenery. when the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums... you get the idea. not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people's nose hair. there are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13" tv. also amruta subhash who plays asavari is the worst actress i've seen in quite a long time. a normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly.i give it 4/10 solely because the subject matter is different, and the story is not bad. the fact that a movie like shwaas gets to be india's entry to the oscars tells volumes not about the state of indian cinema but the state of indian judging committees. a movie is not good just because its subject matter is arty.

this is not a good movie at all. i cannot believe that after fifty years, this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from marathi cinema that have been so systematically ignored. this is a very overrated movie that got very, very lucky. it was given the national award, harvested the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience. anyone with even a marginal understanding of good, quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscars.i cannot understand where to start. there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award. that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this movie.the topic chosen is great. it is important that such movies be made  but only by people who are able to handle them. sandeep sawant does not measure up to the task  not even close. his direction is jumpy, confused. there is no clear thought process. he tries, but is not able to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. he is not able to show the initial horror, anxiety and then hopeless detachment and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather. he wastes our time in the hospital when we should have been shown the time pair spend together. he is trying to cram in everything without any priorities. he does not understand his subject properly and that really counts against him.however, the cast does not help sawant either. worst job  amruta shubash. she is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job. how did she get 'tee phulrani'? extremely lucky and/or extremely influential and/or extremely pitiful casting. having said that, she goes out of her way to do an even terrible job in this movie. her act of the msw should have gone to the more responsible actor  sonali kulkarni. amruta subhash did not understand it. msw's work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm, strong exterior, as this is reassuring to the patients. amruta subhash's asawari seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she is working for.second worst  arun nalawade. i have never seen a more wooden face in marathi film industry (it is abound and everywhere in today's hindi cinema though). he is the producer and so he chose himself; no second thought, no consideration. any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the producer's to do it, but arun nalawade would not let anyone else do it. over ambitious and obtuse, he contributes to bring down the movie more than everyone else combined. his acting lacks research and even the basic acting skills. my choice for this role would be vikram gokhale.the music is uninspired. the movie is technically lacking. it could well have been an ftii project job.on the up side; brilliant performance by ashwin chitale. it is amazing that such a young boy could give such a respectable performance. he put many of today's actors to shame. unintentionally maybe, but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance. also, sandeep kulkarni really gave a very believable performance. really put in all his efforts and it shows. the script too is well written.'shoestring budget' cannot be a valid argument to praise this movie. lack of funds dogs all of the marathi movies. cricket and hindi movies sponge all the money and the rest are left to fight for the scraps. it is a sorry state of affairs but yet not reason enough to praise any immature movie that comes out. 'doghi' was brilliant movie and it too was made on a shoestring budget. 'doghi' also lacked technically but it was well researched and well made. it was abound in details and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and that made it rich cinema. why did it not receive the accolades it so very deserved?  only proves my point of biased judgment.lack of research and not of funds, is what makes 'shwaas' such a bad movie.

the comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. sadly, this version falls far short.the casting is uninspired and the acting wooden. one gets the impression the director did not read the book,so did not understand the characters.sir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found.the musgrove sisters are so unlikable, one doesn't understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glance.the relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feeling.in the 1995 version, hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. in this one, it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book.this production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship.in the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as mary thinks, they are only slight acquaintances.in the 1995 version, when wentworth walks in (the first time he sees her in years), the tension is thick. resentment is coming off wentworth in waves, while anne is almost overcome.in this version, while wentworth is courting lousia, it is as if he is truly invested, the undercurrents are missing. in the 1995 version, the viewer sees wentworth's anger at anne. he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne, as if to say, "see what you gave up, i don't need or want you anymore".yet he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates. in the 1995 version the viewer feels anne's shock that he would care if she was tired, we also feel wentworth's discomfort that he does still care. in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happened.the pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest, man or woman, is totally botched. the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment.when anne reads the letter from wentworth, it is as if she is reading a grocery list.contrast this to the 1995 version, where the viewer feels anne's joy at her second chance. we are there with her as she reads the letter. the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices. wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while anne's is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy.this production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened. the 1995 version didn't need to explain, we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the mrs. smith sub plot intact, while the 1995 version did not.the 1995 version however did include part of austen's original ending. the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr. elliot will want to move back to her house (which he & mrs. croft are renting) after they marry. this is a production to avoid at all costs.

usually when bbc releases a tv series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. usually the tv series is splendid, even if the story is boring, you can trust the acting will make the it worth while. when i came across, persuasion, here at the local library, i was looking forward to an enjoyable evening, cause i read the story.i'm glad i read the story first, otherwise i would not think highly of it. further was i relieved to learn that the production date of this tv series was from 1971, since i thought, until that moment, that bbc had lost it. it is really bad, and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie.the only positive thought i have about this series that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any bbc or other product this century other than the young musgroves sisters, who apparently were taking their fist steps in acting, and doing remarkably well under the direction otherwise given.

oh, my. poor jane must have done the old rolling-over-in-the-grave thing. even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. whatever else you do with austen, the dialog should sparkle (even in this, perhaps her most serious work), and melodrama should be strictly out of bounds. alas, not the case with this production. by the time you get to anne's "frederick, frederick, frederick," you'll either be laughing or crying. unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of austen's work, you can skip this one. if you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.

oh yes, i have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. the acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad, so bad to the point that i find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor. i still wonder who did the casting. each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. none appear to have a true relationship, family or otherwise, with another. the direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. were the film editors asleep?the costumes appear authentic to the regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are jarring and i don't believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk. also the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts, and the women have "big hair"---especially the woman playing anne elliot.all the female characters, young and old, are quite lovely but this doesn't make up for the lack of acting abilities. the actress playing "anne" looks as though she is in her forties while anne elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. i mean, where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing anne believable? she spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out. i wonder still what that was suppose to convey. regret perhaps? yes, this production is regrettable!the actress playing louisa was truly appalling. she screams, squeals, giggles, and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve-year-old (my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this) that i found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out. how this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me. most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek.the actor playing captain wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years.the rejoining of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. how did they get together again? not because louisa was in a coma; that is certain. no, there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film. i rate this production two stars: one because it is austens' work, and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. the only reason i could watch the entire production is that i was off sick with the flu and i got it from the library. if you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds. i would recommend this film even if you have't read the book.

well, anne is way way too old. wentworth looks younger than she and he should not. louisa is much too young and too cheerful oh sister mary is way too pretty. she is supposed to be average, not pretty. when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a complainer. lady russell is too old. this is crazy. if you read the novel, she is anne's older more mature friend, maybe as old as annes mother would be which would be around 18-20 years older than anne- so around 50 not 70! its crazy, doesn't fit. how come anne is so darn happy in the beginning? she smiles when she says "oh the worst is over, i've seen him now the worst has passed" yeah right. ok if anyone has seen the 1995 roger michell version than you cant compare these two. that one is right on. this one is way off. read the novel and you'll know what i mean.

okay, if you discount the production value, the ugly outfits, and the big hair, this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90's version. first ann firbank (playing anne elliot), is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired. amanda root (playing the same role in the 90's version) can express more in her big, brown eyes than firbank can with her entire face in a four hour production. anne is turned into a peevish, whining, boring character (and what was with the scene during the `long walk' where she stops to spout off poetry?). henrietta and louisa looked so much alike that the only time i could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other (henrietta was taller). and louisa! never was there a more obnoxious character! it was ridiculous to think that wentworth was supposed to be interested in her. she is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a chalkboard. when she starts to chant, `to lyme, to lyme, to lyme,' i started yelling, `shut up, shut up, shut up!' the best part of the movie was when louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because i knew i wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie. speaking of the fall at the cobb scene; it was the mose poorly acted, badly directed and edited scene of the entire film. how does a person fall three feet down, land on her feet, and still be knocked unconscious?on the plus size, the character of elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version. they also put in many more scenes with anne and frederick at the end.i'll admit, i have bought this movie, even though i knew how sub par it was, but i'm a huge austen fan, so i'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels. watch this move if you're morbidly curious, or to appreciate the 90's version even more.the bottom line is, this version may follow the letter of the novel, but the 90's version follows the spirit.

this four-hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary, primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen. they seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out. the film opens with sir walter reading from the peerage book that is his primary solace in his troubles. this introduces the family - all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway - but serves little other purpose. similarly, the scenes where the musgroves lament "poor richard" serve no purpose but to drag the story down. some of austen's actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls awkwardly from the tongues of the characters. there is some fill-in dialogue, too, and this is uniformly dreadful. the scene where charles hayter is boring henrietta with his concerns about getting dr. shirley's curacy was only barely interesting as narrative in the book; as a scene in this production, it is stultifying the scene on the cobb, when louisa falls and is "taken up lifeless!", is entirely without urgency, and i wondered whether wentworth's line "is there nobody to help me?" might have been directed at the writers, as well as the other actors.this production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed, rather than an actual film, and this is most evident in the acting, which is the opposite of subtle: booming delivery of lines, exaggerated gestures, and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet, or faces when they are not speaking their lines. charles musgrove stands in his parlour, feet shoulder width apart, and appears to project to the balcony (if there were one) when speaking to the other people in the room with him. louisa musgrove's face, when not actively simpering or giggling, seems to be in confused repose. louisa is a giddy, giggly, ditzy creature, and i did not for a moment believe that wentworth would be interested in her. the costumes are a mixed bunch, but mostly awful, and anne elliot's green tartan gown is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever devised. we are given the dates at the beginning of the show - it is the late 1790's or perhaps very early 1800s - and yet many of the costumes seem to be of victorian design, and thus about 60 years too early! the hair is just so wrong that i won't even mention it here. except to say that i won't mention it. :-)this production does do some things right, however. mrs. smith is given her proper importance, and her history with mr. elliot, his dissipation and his intrigues, are fully addressed. i was also pleased to see the fleshed out "reconciliation" scenes with anne and frederick at the end, which are precious reward for the reader but were glossed over in the 1995 production.if you love the book persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 movie, don't waste a moment (or a penny) on this production; you will find it sorely wanting.

boring, utterly predictable soap opera. mary tyler moore is married to ted danson who's having an affair with christine lahti. moore is friends with lahti and doesn't know about the cheating. danson dies in an accident and lahti is pregnant with his baby. yawn! i'm ashamed to admit i paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986. i liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldn't pull this off. i constantly knew what was going to happen. like another poster said--this plays like a pg-rated lifetime movie.it does have lahti swearing nonstop at one point and even moore lets loose once! also there's a pointless shots of topless women playing football (!!!). other than that it's tv friendly. the only good thing about this was timothy gibbs playing moore and danson's teenage son. very handsome and quite a good actor. that aside there's nothing to recommend this. you've seen it before...and done better. it's obviously been forgotten. skip it.

this is what used to be called a "women's picture" and later a "chick's flick" when times and movies got more juvenile. the plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types. the only appeal for most guys is if they wanna see a too rail-thin mary tyler moore in leotards. (if you're of a certain age, like me, that might still be enough to give it a look.) otherwise mtm gives another of her typical by-the-numbers performances that she's been giving since the early 70s when she took it to heart that she was america's sweetheart. christine lathi gives another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that type. (sorry, but it seems true.) ted danson is too young as mtm's husband and usually gives off a slightly creepy appeal unless he has an acting partner who can soften it. and it doesn't happen here. allan burns wrote & directed and probably got it all through because he worked with mary before, wrote it as a project for her, and she had the juice at this point to get it made. there seems no other purpose to it.

director/screenwriter allan burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. it results in a wincingly unfunny film. christine lahti plays a crass, cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her family--only to discover mary's husband (ted danson) is lahti's secret affair! burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective (just increasingly annoying, because nothing important ever seems to get said). rail-thin moore, looking alarmingly frail in her leotard, has a radiant smile but doesn't convince as danson's wife, and danson gets stuck with a paltry, thankless role (he's just there to be a cad). the movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching (woman's role in the workplace, the tv news-biz, the cheating family man, the working wife and mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friendships, et al), but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only half-heartedly examines the issues. as a writer, he is surprisingly free of punchlines, but is devoid of a purpose as well, and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up. *1/2 from ****

this is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie, and a the oldest that, obviously, is still in existence. this historic piece of film is the opening segment in the "more treasures of the natural archives" dvd.it's only a 15-second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. next to him are two men dancing. near the end, another man walks on the stage. william dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violin player. this "movie" had several titles over the years but the sound experiment was not really a success. it took over 30 years from this point to the synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the public for entertainment. however, this was a start, no matter how primitive it came off. for more of the technical information and history of this film process, see the other review here by "boba fett1138."

by-the-numbers, oscar-hungry biopic about the late, great singer ray charles. there is one -- exactly one -- great scene in *ray*. it occurs during a flashback to charles' youth, after the boy become completely blind. running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother, he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor. he cries out for his mother; she, in keeping with her philosophy that a person should "stand on their own two feet", observes silently and pensively from the kitchen, waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources. the boy proves to be up to the challenge, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a nearby fire-pit, the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window, the scuttling of a cricket across the plank-board floor.the movie pauses, here; it expands; it breathes -- even if for only 40 seconds. the scene is a much-needed respite from taylor hackford's otherwise noisy film. by "noisy" i'm not referring to the music, which is, of course, excellent. i am referring to the sound effects (big booms! preceding yet another flashback) and the inane dialog ("i'm speaking to you as a friend, ray," etc.). on the visual side, hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy: sepia-colored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks; whirling-dervish 360s from the camera-crane, etc. etc. all the modern amenities. what a horrible cinematic style is displayed in *ray*! -- a style all-too-common in wanna-be "important" movies from the past decade or so (scorsese's *aviator* is stylistically very similar to this movie). these gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the cliché-ridden screenplay. some of us won't be fooled.some of us also are not quite prepared to accept jamie foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry. granted, foxx eerily resembles ray charles: he walks like charles, talks like charles, and even twitches like charles. foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. i'm not begrudging mr. foxx his oscar; he deserved it. (it was a pretty weak field this year, anyway.) but one wonders if foxx really understands charles. the actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band-mates are shooting up: he registers, if only for a brief moment, a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness. the movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin, with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions. but the damn movie just won't take the time: it bounces along from triumph to triumph, never really pausing for any insight into the man. one has to stretch to find the dramatic tension; one must supply the drama for the movie. one must, in other words, imagine a better movie than this one.in its rush toward a glorious conclusion, *ray* introduces, then dodges, several excellent ideas for a movie: his early days on the "chitlin circuit"; his bold musical innovations for the atlantic label; the problem of his addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success; the man's importance to the civil rights struggle (touched on in the movie for, oh, about 3 minutes of screen-time), and much more. the filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements. two-and-a-half hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good, but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art. this sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject -- and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this? if i had wanted a laundry-list of ray charles' accomplishments, i'd have simply googled him.3 stars out of 10 -- the extra 2 stars strictly for the music.

i was supremely disappointed with this one. having just read the wonderful oscar wilde story, i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen. well, there was none. this version played like a condensed, dumbed down reader's digest movie. not only did it feel rushed, it was cheapened and needlessly re written. major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed. i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially on what may very well have been a limited (tv) budget, but there is no excuse for mangling a great story in this way. i thoroughly recommend reading wilde's tale of the depravity that exists under even the most beautiful exteriors. but i cannot advise anyone to rent this travesty.

i bought a tape of this film based on the recommendation of other imdb users and have to say that i was very disappointed. i'm a college professor and showed this movie to my class; they unanimously voted that it's a terrible film. i guess that if you like the old dark shadows series, then maybe you'll like this. (i liked dark shadows when i was a kid in the '70s, but now i think it's just awful). the first half hour or so at least has the virtue of some fidelity to wilde's novel. after that, the story veers wildly off course, at least as compared with the 1945 mgm version (which won two oscars). nigel davenport as lord henry is really about the only thing watchable in the whole production. a lot of the other acting is bad, the music is melodramatic, and look of the film is terrible. actually, it's not a film at all--it was obviously shot on video and has that characteristically claustrophobic bbc look about it. the opening scenes are particularly poorly lit, the women's costumes are terrible (the men look all right), and a lot of the characters--including dorian--seem to have 1970s rather than victorian hairstyles. the movie does well to include a lot of wilde's dialog, but the voice-over narration in the voice of dorian contains a lot of rubbish that directly contradicts wilde's character. i'm a big oscar wilde fan, and i fear that he must have rolled over violently in his grave when this monstrosity was made. its only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more apparent, without being heavy-handed. i haven't seen either of the more recent versions, but if one is interested in seeing the story well told, i would have to recommend the 1945 mgm black-and-white over this one.

it only took one viewing of this dog, for me to say "never again!" it's so profoundly unmemorable that i had to read other people's reactions to it before i could remember anything beyond (1) it was awful, (2) connery should have quit while he was ahead, and (3) the film included a total gross-out bit involving faking a retinal scan through the most gruesome (not to mention horribly inefficient) means possible.actually, i've never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of connery's bond films over even the worst moore or dalton outings. or lazenby, brosnan, or even david niven, for that matter. i personally found octopussy and moonraker, among other "canonical" bond films, to be far more entertaining than this, and probably for the very same reasons why others deprecate the moore bond films, namely their wry humor, and their willingness to surrender to the preposterousness of the whole basic bond milieu.

thunderball and never are two of the biggest box office misses and never is a surprise farce from empire strikes back hero irvin kershner. klaus maria brandauer seems to steal the show, when, in the midst of the unfolding plot, bond's mission turns more to hollywood romp (sometime around when basinger comes in). how about klaus kinski? i still think that the casting of largo makes or, as is evident in both films, breaks the story. worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the '60s. the '80s was a barren time for bond flicks mostly, though for your eyes only is a great title. at times, when i happen to need to waste some time over the holidays by watching this film in the often string of bond re-run festivals, i think the best attribute of the film is its score, and i'm not into soft '80s 'jazz'.

connery climbs aboard the moore buffoon train in this stinker of a movie. tossing away everything that made bond successful in the first place, this movie further degrades the bond character throwing him into the category of inspector gadget. get smart this ain't. there is no style here, only second rate actors performing on cheap sets. it's a shame that connery couldn't lend an element of class here but it doesn't come across. everything here reeks of mediocrity, including connery's bad toupee. perhaps if i was snowed in and given the choice between watching "never say never again" and "howard the duck" i would choose the former. if you want the real james bond, pick up any ian flemming novel.

this is more than just an adaptation of bond: it's a plain rip off! with mediocre character sketches that ian fleming would not have approved of, this film goes down as the worst 007 movie. an older (even haggard) connery tries to relive his past 12 years later. the result is a humourless, tacky version of the classic hero. give me roger moore any day!

sad in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for connery was neither that nor the hit warners wanted it to be. overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and "robocop 2" are proof that irvin kershner did not have any real control over "the empire strikes back." connery hadn't been in a hit since he bowed out from bond in 1971, but this didn't bring him back at all. "octopussy" was released several months before this film, and easily outgrossed it. imagine that - a roger moore bond not only better than a simultaneous connery release, but outgrossing it (and compared to "never...," "octopussy" is on par with "2001."the worst bond theme song, even worse than "the man with the golden gun," pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - my god - who cares?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talent as far as the fabled "bond girls" go. does anybody seriously think kim basinger is attractive in this movie? there were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this. and barbara carrera - just plain stupid - but the way kershner has directed her to prance around all the time didn't help her out any. she is the seedling that would become the very impressive "onatop," which was about the best feature of "goldeneye," but that doesn't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film.casting leiter as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad. two actors never appeared so clumsily linked together - witness the scene where, to escape local authorities, they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising - i can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh.

though some would prefer to comment on the value of bond movies in the connection of learning frequency, and while most of the jargon that tends to limit bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention, there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of sean connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by jessica tandy in driving miss daisy. while connery had been less visible in the latter, his woman-seeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which, to most involved, approached the 007 theme with kind resentment, albeit while the general flavor had been altered. great for those who interest others while faking to be who you're not!

not as bad as some people say...this is a unofficial bond movie and a remake of "thunderball", written by kevin mcclory (co- producer in "thunderball"). well, the cast is very very interesting, maria brandauer is a great bond- villain, kim basinger and barbara carrera are just like the "original" bond- girls, plus rowan atkinson and a truly great edward fox, who looks really refreshing in the "m" role. in fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses. sean connery does it once more confident and charming, except that he looks a little bit too old. but alright, he is the original bond and it was great to see him once more in this role. the locations are also typical- bahamas, france, etc. the only thing that really fails is the music score, the song "never say never again" is o.k., but the theme song is just missing. all in one, a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly roger moore movies like "moonraker". only if there was another story, "thunderball" was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake

words cannot describe how asinine, juvenile,and repetitive this steaming pile of a series is. it relies on 3 things: 1. constant 80s pop culture references 2. the tired "stretch out a joke to the point of awkwardness" bit, and 3. at least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode. the only reason i can see for this crap fest being as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references which i suppose elicit an "omg lol that's from superfriends!! that is so totally ironic, and i am so edgy and smart for getting it!!" response from the viewer. the writing is beyond lazy, and panders to its viewers, mostly in their 20s and 30s. plus there's the character design, which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and maybe a different hairline occasionally. insulting crap.

this is the most overrated show on television. i believe people continue to watch it because they feel they should, because it has become somewhat of a "cool" show to watch and talk to your friends about the next day at work or school. rarely does it actually elicit anything more than a chuckle and never provokes any sense of irony or thought from the audience. every joke is interchangeable with "punchlines" that seem to be drawn out of a hat. the complete lack of originality combined with the even somehow lamer spin off it has spawned (see: american dad) makes me question the intelliegence of an audience that continues to keep this horrid show on tv. i award family guy no points and may god have mercy on its soul...

in a quiet town a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named milo, who lives on the other side of town. after the murder, his body is found in a river and his pronounced dead. so sixteen years later a weddings draws the girls back to their childhood town and claire a school teacher becomes obsessed that milo hasn't died as she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims milo is apart of it. so now, she sets off to find out the horrifying truth.when i came across this film, i was pretty sceptical about it, especially when it had "from the creators of anaconda" on the front cover, but reading the odd little plot outline on the back of the video case, it sounded alright and rather refreshing for a change. well, guess what? i thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the film. it just seemed to try to hard to be smart and very psychological based, but that latter element didn't come off that well for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller. hey, i'll admit it had its moments, but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling, or memorable. but, a bravo to the filmmakers, at least the story isn't a rehash of those slasher imitators that followed "scream" and shock horror, there's no self-referential humour evident actually there isn't even a hint of humour. although, maybe it was too serious? especially, since the plot is rather absurd, but that's not its main problem. what a disjointed plot we get, i didn't know about to much that was going on, as it seems to skim a lot stuff in favour for some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences. no! more like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing clichés that we see from time to time. also you can see some influences from some "good" 70's horror films, one being "don't look now". this when our main character keeps on seeing the figure of her past in a slicker. the other would have to be one of my favourites "alice, sweet alice" with the person causing the trouble wearing a yellow slicker and committing grisly deaths. interesting idea but it comes across quite shallow and too many faults pop up. i liked it more when the scenes dealt with the character's childhood, as the performances and circumstances had something creepy about it, but when it leans into their adulthood its tired and uneventful for most part and the performances weren't awful, but incredibly mundane and hardly involving is a good way of putting it. most of the dialogue had me groaning in disbelief at how contrived and awkward it was. you'll be yelling "no duh!" at the screen, because you just can't believe what you're hearing. the police detective gets the brunt of it! quality wise - the film isn't bad, actually it's better then your usual straight to video i would say. very slick stuff. with some inventive and prominent camera angles and a faint score that works reasonably well. another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and that bicycle bell does leave a ringing sensation in your ears. the setting of a quiet elementary school was well done and rest of the action takes place in a house. but, just don't be expecting any real suspense or surprises as the execution of these are non-existent. the deaths aren't pleasant and they're mildly bloody and it's more the aftermath to what happens to these bodies, which tries to disturb you. the villain in this piece, the mean-spirited child milo jeeder was mildly unnerving, well that voice and yellow slicker does make an imprint to begin with, but it does seem to lose its effect when we come to the films conclusion. the cheesy tag lines on the video compare him to (move over) jason, (watch out) freddy and (this isn't child's play) chucky, but you got to be kidding me! right? he's labelled "the new face of evil", yeah sure. all he needs is to be taught some manners and problem solved. overall, the film just left me with a sour taste, as i've could've gone without seeing it. i probably wished i did.just don't expect too much in this blur of a film. or, even better just skip it, as you won't be missing out on much, really.

this "horror" movie lacks any horror or even mild suspense. even the gore is not good. the plot would have some promise if it was done by someone who cared about what they're writing/filming, but the people who made this movie obviously did not. basically, the film proceeds in a series of fits and starts thusly:main character insists she's not crazy."milo" lurks about in his yellow raincoat or rides in front of a car on his bike.main character insists she's not crazy and rambles on about her passion as a schoolteacher.someone gets killed in an unsatisfying manner.main character insists she's not crazy and musters up a few fake sobs.are we seeing a pattern here? if you don't, you may enjoy this film. otherwise, watch something else. the budget is low, low, low and it shows (unlike say, the evil dead, which makes you forget about its crap budget), and the acting is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of the janitor). in general the movie is boring, boring, boring. i can't think of a single scene that's actually done well. in fact, i disliked the movie so much i actually turned it off ten minutes before the end, something i very rarely do... heck, i watched the non-mstied manos, the clones, and wild wild west all the way through.3/10. spare yourself and watch phantasm again.

"milo" is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.do we really need more slashers?i for one think we already have more than enough.i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.a long time ago,he drowned but that didn't bother him and he still kills people("friday the 13th",what's that?).one day,his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist,milo comes to pay them a visit.through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo's dull,i mean dark secret.she and her friends have been dying to know.once discovered,milo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isn't it his bedtime yet?) and the girl,well she screams a lot.the acting is not even bottom of the barrel,the barrel refuses to be associated with it.milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that,but some movies just can't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity.

if it wasn't for the very attractive jennifer jostyn in the lead role, i would have turned "milo" off after the first 30 minutes. however, as easy on the eyes as she is, she's not enough to save this film, not by a long shot.milo starts off with a group of young girls accompanying an "assumed young boy" in a yellow slicker to a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in jars. apparently, the deal was that if he showed them the jars, ol' milo gets to conduct a gynecologist exam on each in return. one of the group volunteers to be milo's "first patient" and he leads her behind closed doors. moments later blood flows from under the door and we are whisked into present day. enter the lovely jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up in present day. a substitute teacher with shallow confidence whose closest friend appears to be a goldfish, she receives an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding. yep! you guessed it. return to miloville. milo, who allegedly drowned years ago, seems to be having a dilemma staying dead and begins terrorizing and murdering the girls he failed to "examine" all those years ago.milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants from cronenberg's "the brood." he could have been scary, but just how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow raincoat? the plot confuses even itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back. i'm sending milo, an inept slasher film, to stand in the corner!

this movie was horrible. if it had never been made the world would be a better place. come on, a flying wagon? what were they thinking? this was a sub-par movie with a horrible hook, and i would like a written apology from the studio that produced this, along with some cookies to help repay me for the time i wasted on this crap fest that i can never get back. if you payed to see this movie, i am truly sorry because i watched it on tv on a sunday afternoon when i had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week. a flying freaking wagon?!?! and that's supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own screwed up needs than her children? no wonder they don't have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them, their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else. absolutely horrible.

this was one of the most mixed up films i have ever seen. everything in the movie seemed to be attached to justify some other element that had been glued on. there is even a talking buffalo that wants his wet nose rubbed to make the magic happen. even the brutal father seems to be stuck in just to give the kids an excuse to fly away in a wagon. it was laughable, but in an uncomfortable way because of the serious subjects that seemed to be used just to set up the plot.

geoffrey wright, the director of "romper stomper", transplants shakespeare's "macbeth" in the contemporary, criminal underworld of melbourne, australia. the result is a semi-awful piece of cinema. sam worthington is macbeth, and walks around looking very self-conscious and bored. victoria hill, who wrote the script with wright, is lady macbeth, and she's neither awful nor good. lachy hulme, who plays mcduff, is the only actor in the cast who exudes any kind of authority. the rest, including gary sweet, are wasted and misdirected. shot on hd by the late will gibson, the movie's visuals lack character. everything is too clean and too deliberately lit. wright's direction is uninspired in the extreme and the action sequences are confusing and inept. marketed erroneously as "the most violent australia movie ever", the film is violent at times and reasonably bloody, but it fails to deliver a single impactful moment. slow moving and terribly pretentious, this umpteenth silver screen version of the classic play is the personification of wrong-headed.

if you want a horrible interpretation of "macbeth", then this is your answer. filled with archaic shakespearic english language in a 21st century australian setting, this film lives to disappoint and leave you scratching your head. but that isn't all.not only is there sophomoric action sequences but there are plenty of scenes where the female body is displayed. the witches, played by actresses that resemble school girls more than witches, put on a soft porn display with macbeth in a unremarkable display of affection. welcome to stupidity and depravity - all at the same time.its a wonder why this project was green-lighted. so much for modern cheesy movies. "d-"

recap: not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth, but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original, only set in present time. it tells the story of macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne (?). he is a valued hit-man and in the favor of leader duncan. but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that, and plan the murder of duncan, and any competition of the throne. this is a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death.comments: very interesting idea, i must say. to use the story but change the setting to present time, but still keep the original (?) dialog. it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence. promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that it keeps, but not in the notion i imagined. it is very bloody indeed, but the violence is slow. not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated, which it is too, but also literally. a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees.what could have been a unique strength, the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence, now turns into something else entirely. now both slow the move down painfully much, so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times.also i can't figure out the context the three witches act within. set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie. apparently it does, but to me it seems completely out of place. not a subplot but a complete sub-story with it's own rules, completely different than the rest of the movie. seems completely out of place. surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern. drug-induced hallucinations perhaps (which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable)? now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin again.a clear disappointment, but maybe something for shakespearean-buffs?4/10

this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that's holding it back.awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by victoria hill), but a let down in practically every other way.an "adaptation" of sorts, it brought nothing new to macbeth (no, setting it in present-day australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let's face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. if there's one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it's shakespeare's. so any adaptation, if it's not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.and that's what this macbeth fails to do. as it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. it's the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. except with guns and in different outfits.apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which i completely tuned out, even though i was looking at the screen. i never thought i had a short attention span, but there you go.i suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. but as australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.a shame. an absolute shame.

the play macbeth was written by william shakespeare between the years of 1604 and 1606. ever since then, many other versions of the play have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971, and 2006. akira kurosawa even directed a japanese version of macbeth in 1957 entitled, "kumonosu jô." the play starts out with king duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals, macbeth and banquo, in a recent battle with the irish and the norwegians. after a quick promotion from duncan, macbeth instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust, greed, and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder.geoffrey wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern melbourne underworld. just imagine a lowly macbeth slaying hundreds of soldiers with an ak-47 and rapping his own rendition of, "low" at the same time. just kidding about the latter, but one thing he does do is utter the traditional shakespeare. and he keeps it going throughout the whole movie. that's right! shakespeare meets ghetto. it's all you could ever hope for! not the newest macbeth is rough and violent enough to match up with any other modern day action film, but it lacks decent acting, the right lingo, and a good technique of camera work.the modernized movie starts out with macbeth (sam worthington) who works as a hit man/drug dealer for duncan (gary sweet), a drug lord from melbourne, australia. after being promoted to the thane of glamis by duncan (as the three witches had predicted), aspiration starts to take over macbeth as he sets his eyes on the throne. after promoting macbeth, duncan invites himself over to macbeth's house for a night of drugs and alcohol. before the festivities begin, lady macbeth (victoria hall) talks macbeth into killing duncan to take power over the throne. after the bodyguards are drunk and everyone's asleep, macbeth sneaks into duncan's room and stabs him to death. after his murder, macbeth takes all of duncan's belongings including hid title and crown. just as soon as he thinks he's got what he wanted, he finds out that it will take more than bribery and running away to solve his problems. one major flaw of the movie was the acting. a once seemingly flamboyant and empowered macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy. and he looks like a sad puppy dog throughout the entire film. i don't really know if this was worthington's or wright's fault, but either way, one of the two should have realized macbeth was a king, not a knot on a log that took everything his wife had to say literally. like i said earlier, macbeth should have been rude, arrogant, and spiteful. but when his character changes over to a drug lord, he changes personalities as well i suppose. on the other hand, lady macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character. she didn't seem quite as spiteful as she was in the play or the 1971 version, but she reminds macbeth that compared to murder, anything else he could possibly do, wouldn't quite match up. another thing i found distasteful was all the nudity. this fluke had to be wright's fault. the witches didn't do a bit of acting, unless you call parading around in your birthday suit acting. at one point in the film, i started to wonder if i was watching macbeth or unique positions vol. 2. don't get me wrong when i say i find the shakespearean dialogue out of place. it's spoken flawlessly, but when it's spoken by an australian gangster, it's just really weird. when macbeth starts to kill people off, he first lets them know by talking to them in ye olde english. macbeth contains plenty of action, blood, gore, and nudity to last anyone a lifetime. you forget all the positive facts though when you start to think to yourself, "okay, what in the heck did he just say in that last sentence?" at some points in the movie, i don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. the new age-ness of the movie could have easily been pulled off it weren't for the, "thou's" and the, "thee's". the camera work was just simply fair for me. one thing i could not stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters. the camera technique used gave off that blair witch sort of vibe and made me throw up a little in my mouth. matt reeves tried to attempt the same concept of camera work in, clover field but it just doesn't work. it makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little barf bags they have conveniently planted on every seat in the airplanes. looking back on it all, the gangsta' macbeth holds one positive: plenty of action. other than that, the movie contains nothing more than uninspired acting, correct english usage, and stomach-turning camera work. the soundtrack holds one or two of the same songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for every scene. there is never a variation of interesting or captivating media used. from now on out, directors should leave the dangerous drug underworld to al pacino and robert deniro. future renditions of macbeth should be created just as shakespeare intended the play to be 400 years ago. i would recommend using medieval clothing, ye olde english, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by enya. but either way, the modern macbeth makes you yearn for some good 'ole folk music, a camp fire, and a bustier.

macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings. originally written by william shakespeare in the early 1600's, macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man's quest for power. director geoffrey wright (romper stomper) tries his hand at updating macbeth by setting it in the contemporary melbourne underworld. a film where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala baz luhrman's romeo and juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, macbeth is a gritty, violent, but critically flawed film.macbeth (sam worthington)works for king duncan (gary sweet). after being elevated to the thane of glamis by the king (as was prophesied to macbeth by three witches), macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne. one night the king comes to stay at macbeth's house and lady macbeth (victoria hill) talks him into killing the king to assume power. macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown. but success has it's downside, as macbeth soon finds out, when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret. ok, first things first. the film's major fault is sam worthington. his portrayal of macbeth is in a word... boring. i honestly didn't care about macbeth while watching the film. i had more sympathy for victoria hill's lady macbeth because she bothered to act at least. worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film. i felt like he was doing his best impression of johnny deep's george jung character from blow... but without the charisma. i have never seen worthington in a film before so i'm not sure if it was his or the director's fault, but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak.the dialog is good, but when matched up to the geoffrey wright's australian gangster motif seems a bit out of place. frentically paced action sequences mixed with long shaksperian musings creates pacing conflict within the film. i understand that this is macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact. but hard, fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. the camera-work is highly stylized, and for the most part, it works well. one thing that i found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth, almost constantly. i don't mind shots like that it's just overdone. it's passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating. other than that, the art direction and cinematography is fairly well-done. for all of the good qualities macbeth possesses; stylish direction, shakespearian dialog, a strong soundtrack, supernatural nude witches(the weird sisters), and good helpings of brutal, bloody violence. all of these strengths are forgotten when one considers sam worthington's uninspired portrayal of macbeth. the role of macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect geoffrey wright and sam worthington failed miserably, making macbeth a forgettable foray into shakespeare.

the story of macbeth was one of the most successful shakespeare ever wrote. this may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre, murder, murder, kill, kill, gallons of blood, a tense sexual relation between the main characters etc. more than this, the original play is very appealing taking into consideration the length (it's only half the size of hamlet) and the focus on macbeth for whom we are constrained to care in spite of his bloody nature. the play would seem ideal to base a movie on. not so lengthy it gives the directors the possibility to explore it's many levels, a good actor can play the role of his lifetime, the film has deep meaning in any historical period. unfortunately this has not been the case with macbeth. polanski's version comes quite close but it insists too much on the medieval period. welles' film is too personal, with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism, the 1990 or so tv version is too shallow. this 2006 movie is no exception. it is very far from a shakespeare film, but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life. no knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars. a lot of drugs and trippy music replace the dread of night in the original play. the idea of macbeth is so simple that to take and implant it in modern day life doesn't need shakespeare at all. the worst part in the film are the lines. most of the poignant scenes of the play, such as the dagger scene are trimmed so much they seem pointless. replacing the knocks in the door with doorbells and horses with cars seems funny. if they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation they could have done it easily without shakespeare. this macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury not a valiant warrior, brave and ambitious that wants power so much he is prepared to to kill and who gets caught up in a net of fears and despair. the movie doesn't make clear what drives lady macbeth to madness, it doesn't give a reason why some of the characters should fear macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne, what with no throne and all) and it places macbeth in an awkward position, since the leadership of a gang is as far from kingship as this whole movie is far from any shakespeare. in conclusion, we have two superimposed ideas that never quite meet making this a film that's ultimately pointless.... stand not upon the order of your going but go!

an interesting concept turned into carnage...my first seeing feature from geoffrey wright (romper stomper), when i first took interest in it, it seemed at the time an interesting concept...shakespere + aussie film + gothic setting + melbourne ganglanda very odd mixed that turned into a disastrous piece of aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name...pros: -interesting conceptcons: -waste of a good cast -stuffed and stupid plot -crooked camera angles -not much variety of locations -crap use of shakespearian diologueoverall: australia's worst attempt of a shakespere film, stick to baz lurhman...or romper stomper (warning: that film is dangerous)

a very hyped-up, slick, edgy reinterpretation.they've fallen into the "because it's modern, it has to be hyped-up, slick, etc." trap."romeo and juliet" carried this idea off much more successfully, but i really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. edgy film).just because this is a "modern" retelling, doesn't mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad, or have anything to do with drugs or guns.if the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words, macbeth would be a far more powerful film. as it is, read your shakespeare. read it out loud. ask your oxford dictionary some questions. skip the film. or don't, but you've been warned.sorry for the super-long review. imdb made me do it.

i just caught "farewell to the king" on cable, and maybe it's just because i'm a girl, but i thought this was on the craptastic side. the script and direction are pretentious (once i found out john milius was responsible, it all became clear). the supporting actors actually weren't bad - james fox was outstanding. the biggest disappointment was nick nolte, who i usually enjoy. once he goes native, he starts speaking a very stiff, stilted english, and half the time, he seems kind of distracted, as if he'd just smoked some of the bounty of borneo's rain forest. and then the end -- what the ??? learoyd just happens to be on the same boat as the botanist (by the way, had the botanist dumped the girlfriend, or what?)??? the boat just happens to run aground conveniently close to an island ripe takeover by a crazy anglo ex-headhunting army deserter??

the story of farewell to the king is intriguing. an american "deserter" (i had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the philippines as their desperate escape by raft to borneo is not your classic desertion). but no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the japanese. nolte's character (a sergeant) has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed. and incredibly, no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him. but anyway, nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman. so he's out of the war. then the british commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanese.unfortunately, nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story. instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command, nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe. he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. he makes sweeping gestures when he talks, and acts like he is one with nature, as if he was raised in the jungle.there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british interacting with nolte and the tribe. but nolte's character is never believable. it always looks like he's overacting. he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a tribesman. as it is, he comes across, not as a regal king, but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is. but that is not the intent of the film, as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british commandos. there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange. he is simply viewed by the british as the defacto leader of the tribe. thus, it always seems that nolte's character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film.another actor might have done a great job with the role, delivered his lines believably, and made it an outstanding movie. but nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be.what a waste.

this world war ii film, set in borneo, tries so hard to work on so many levels, it is a shame it fails on all of them.nick nolte is an escaping american who witnesses the executions of his comrades by the japanese. he wanders deep into the jungles of borneo, lost. cue nigel havers, who finds nolte's adopted tribe. nolte, now looking like robert plant, has become his tribe's new king. he defeated a staunch warrior in a bloody battle, and had a telling tattoo on his chest (a dragon). now before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to borneo, things are not going well in nolteland. havers wants the tribe's help in fighting the japanese, who are invading the island. he teaches the natives how to use machine guns, and a whole lot o shooting begins. as the tribe becomes more successful, they run up against a new squadron of japanese who are not like the others. this squad cannibalizes the villages they conquer in order to keep their strength up (talk about your sushi), and they move through the jungles even quicker than the tribe. since we know the outcome of the war, we know eventually the tribe triumphs, but with heavy casualties. here come the spoilers: havers is injured and returned to "civilization." he gives the location of the kingdom and nolte is captured. havers then goes through the trouble of releasing nolte, and the end credits roll.milius' direction is certainly adequate, but the screenplay here is rather vague in its motivations. it presents story ideas, then abandons them in order to get to the next story idea. nolte is awful as the soldier turned king, desperately trying to channel the spirit of marlon brando's colonel kurtz. he talks about freedom, and the beauty of the jungle, and the richness of his people, and you will not believe for one second the words he utters. he is often unintentionally funny, especially his initial bug out in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the film sounding like a hippie. nigel havers spends the movie looking at nolte like he was raquel welch. the vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship, not quite to sex, and settles into an unspoken relationship that must have had the natives talking.havers often stands around and has an internal conflict, repulsed at the tribe's headhunting, but basking in nolte's attention. his fellow straight laced british servicemen go native faster than the bounty landing party in tahiti, but all i saw concerning borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green.the climactic betrayal, where havers gives away nolte's location, is completely devoid of any reason. there is not one thought given as to why havers does this, except to keep the film going. i was angry, when by chance, havers and nolte end up on the same ship going to the philippines, the ship happens to run aground, and havers runs to the hold to free the freshly shorn nolte. no goodbye kiss, but havers says farewell to the king, explaining the title.if you were fighting a war, and an enemy squadron was eating your allies, would that not freak you out? this elite japanese squad is not shown enough, although their eating habits are so horrific i would become a conscientious objector right away. the same type of ghostly enemy was handled much better in "the 13th warrior."other types of interesting ideas are dropped. what about the fact that then modern technology brings about the deaths of so many backward people? why did king nolte let the brits use his subjects without too much hesitation? why can't hollywood find a decent actor to play general douglas macarthur?in the end, "farewell to the king" is a letdown, not anchored by a strong lead, and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring its options. i cannot recommend this one.this film is rated (pg13) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, some gore, some profanity, some sexual references, and adult situations.

other than john krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. the lacey chabert and andrew keegan love story was as clichéd as possible, full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldn't ever let them be together and super-hammy longing looks. none of the "emotion" had any depth or reality whatsoever. the two accented-characters (dean edwards as rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expert)....once they saw how bad the accents were, couldn't they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience headaches? apparently not. i don't even know where to start with the editing, particularly the sound editing. if you hate obvious over-dubbing as much as i do, don't watch this. that being said, krasinski was great. off the bat i'll admit that i'm a huge office fan and that's why i rented this. but he's quite entertaining as the "off-the-wall friend with crazy ideas". he's got a clichéd role, but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. the ending was awful. just flat out terrible. the idea of the robbery gone awry had potential, but keegan floundering around after being shot, all the way to his studio to fall ontop of a painting of chabert (which looks nothing like her) is the most cringe-worthy scene.

this was truly horrible. bad acting, bad writing, bad effects, bad scripting, bad camera shots, bad filming, bad characters, bad music, bad editing, bad casting, bad storyline, bad ... well, you get the idea. it was just, just ... what's the word? oh yeah ... bad!

if this film becomes a holiday tradition i am going to have to hide for christmas for the rest of my life. how do you even think of comparing this with 'a wonderful life'! it was absolutely awful! the boy singing made my toes curl. and what on earth was the deal with his hair?? emmy worthy performance?! please. granted, lucci did ok but an emmy????? i think this film is a waste of money. the fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse. it lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts. lighting, wardrobe, make-up, it seemed everybody wanted to go home. just a big no from me.

meek and mild edward g. robinson (as wilbert winkle) decides to quit his bank job and do what he wants, open a "fix-it" repair shop behind his house. mr. robinson is married, but childless; he has befriended local orphanage resident ted donaldson (as barry). young donaldson is an eager workshop assistant, and sees robinson as a father figure. robinson's nagging wife ruth warwick (as amy) is unhappy with robinson's job choice, and conspires to return matters to her idea of normalcy. their lives are further disrupted when robinson is drafted.the war also disrupts what might have been an interesting story, as robinson's character struggles against a domineering, unsympathetic wife. possibly, filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives. robinson and donaldson are a likable team. robert mitchum has an inauspicious bit part. the ending "trick" played by ms. warwick and donaldson is predictably staged.

although i do not recommend this film, neither do i recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. though i have not given away the ending, or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. it's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film donnie darko, as there are many to deal with. richard kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. the result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. the film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of cgi effects and neo-surrealism. the main character, donnie darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life. we are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. for example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the smurfs, and donnie counters with a theory of his own, his friend complains about donnie acting "all smart." donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of his friend-- just angrier. the only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the fear-love sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. in fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. the ambiguity of donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. this would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the "science" behind the "fiction" is very shaky. the explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. we get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. the scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject, he'd be fired. apparently no further explanation is needed). donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. the justification for these actions is a tricky business. he damages his school, but it's okay, because his school doesn't treat him like a person. his punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to tom cruise's character in magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. but should the audience believe that donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? he himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. the story is set in 1988, just before the bush/dukakis election, and the director touches on this point during the film. the focus, however, extends exactly this far: donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for bush, while his free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for dukakis. there is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. the former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. likewise, donnie's heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of "fear and "love;" this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. mr. kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film: e.t., stephen king, the smurfs, back to the future. at it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantments, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. the awkward mess that is donnie darko leaves us wondering if mr. kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film, or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort.my rating: 1/10.

how to qualify this film, simply horrible. it is badly done with poor dialogues, reeves played as bad as ever and cameron diaz competed with him. do not waste your time watching such a film although a big waste of money has already occurred to make the film.

warning! spoiler! this movie is absolute crap. it is not entertainment. i haven't the words to describe the disgust that i felt at the end.this is a badly made movie about the scum of society. during the whole movie i kept waiting for it to get better. it didn't. instead, it just kept getting worse and worse.when i see a movie that is as bad as this one i always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. in this case it proved impossible. i have not one good thing to say about it. how bad did it get? well, here's an example: towards the end dan akroyd smothers and kills vincent d'onofrio while reeves and diaz watch! this is not entertainment!

i don't remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of luminaires (lamps). almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and wanton destruction of useful light fixtures, even if outfitted with cheesy, '70's-style, cylindrical shades to keep with the time setting of the story. on one occasion, raucous lamp destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and dining rooms of their mother's house, with fixtures in both rooms being taken out. yet, the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a bookie's office and includes, but is not limited to, the toppling of a fixture with a ceramic horse-head base, which is consequently disintegrated, and the severe denting of a cylindrical shade as a guy falls back into it during another fisticuffs fight. later, that lamp is toppled as well when the guy is shot, incurring further damage to the plastic-coated shade.while this movie encourages a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps, one should keep in mind that lamps, regardless of their cheap construction or gauche, top-heavy appearance, are still valuable for the illumination that they provide. however, if you ever feel the need to vicariously smash a lamp, i would highly recommend this movie.

i want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. the acting was horrific! i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent d'onofrio. i will never look at them the same again. keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not a surprise. everyone knows they never could act. thankfully, only dan attempted an accent. his accent was a disaster as expected. i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota. i hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read.

a waste of time, talent and shelf space, this is a truly abysmal film. what are big leaguers like keanu reeves, cameron diaz and dan aykroyd wasting their time being in such rubbish?. petty criminal reeves turns up to his brothers (vincent d'onofrio) wedding and ends up leaving with the bride. a comedy?, thriller?, romance? i honestly do not know! reeves is wooden in the lead and casting dan aykroyd as a cop is so dreadful it has to be seen to be believed!. only bright spot from a dark dark tunnel is diaz and even she isn't that good. rent out something else. everyone involved with this mess should hold there heads in utter shame and prey that it gets lost in oblivion in the years to come.

ok, if i was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three bucks for the rental, i'd have to say no. the plot was implausible. i've come to the conclusion that keanu reeves can not act. he can, at times, be painful to watch (though my wife thinks he's cute). dan aykroyd (who is usually great) was even a little disappointing as the crooked cop. on the plus side, the plot (because it is far-fetched) is unpredictable. cameron diaz was good.

this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through. and that's saying alot, because i've seen my share of horrible movies.but i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser. seriously, there was not one respectable character in the entire script. how fitting that the plot was equally lame, lacking any intelligence whatsoever.i can't believe that keanu reeves and cameron diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity. and while i haven't seen all of their other movies, i've always enjoyed their performances until now. it's not that the acting was bad, just the entire story line was moronic.

what a waste of talent. a very poor, semi-coherent, script cripples this film. rather unimaginative direction, too. some very faint echoes of _fargo_ here, but it just doesn't come off.

during a lifetime of seeing and enjoying thousands of films, feeling minnesota is absolutely the worst (**major film with a-list stars) that i have ever seen. bar none. this movie totally fails on every level. it's poorly photographed and edited. there's uninspired acting, the kind where the actors appear bored out of their minds. just collecting paychecks, perhaps? and worst of all, the sludgy script appears to have been written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in sewers. i can't even begin to comprehend how the writer/director could ever have found anyone to finance this project, let alone attract any of the stars that it did. i truly wish i could get back the time that i wasted watching this piece of garbage. if possible, i would have given this film a grade of zero. better yet, a negative number.

feeling minnesota is one of the worst films i have ever seen, it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made. it has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man. at the wedding she meets his brother jjaks. they have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run away together. the other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife. jjaks wakes up to find her corpse in the bathtub and buries her. he than seems to become friends with jjaks and they try to get money together because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body. this loops about and several characters dies or come back to life, but it never comes together with anything that could be called a good plot. the performances are horrible by pretty much everybody. cameron diaz, keanu reeves, and dan akroyed. the direction, dialogue, and visual effects are just horrible. a disgusting and horrible movie.

j.j. jameson (from spiderman 2) quote ... crap, crap, ...mega-crap it pretends to be an homage (un/intentional) to the coen brothers ... done poorly.there is no real mystery to the plot.diaz's performance is totally uninspired.the quirky characters don't really work.there are a lot of "duh" moments.i love black comedy, but this film isn't funny.in my view, it wasn't worth the electricity.there are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining.i hope you find this review helpful.

it hasn't even been two years since i first saw this film, and yet, i can barely remember a thing about this movie. needless to say, i found it to be very forgettable. of what i do remember, nothing stands out as particularly good. a talented cast is wasted in what i suppose was meant to be a dark comedy, but if that is the case, it fails miserably. at best, this film is mildly interesting. at worst, the seemingly omnipresent overcast skies are more interesting than the storyline. if you like watching films where it always seems damp and cool, then i guess you may find something to like in this picture. just try to ignore what else is going on, because it is barely watchable.

the first time i saw this film it was with this cute girl i was attracted to. we had a lot of fun laughing at it and generally making fun. so my impression was that it was terrible but watchable for cheeseyness value. then, as part of our anniversary, we watched it together again on video. as it turns out, the movie is just terrible and unwatchable. it's amazing how cute girls can change the way the world looks.

feeling minnesota is not really a road movie, but that's still the best categorization i can generate. a road movie does not primarily depend on a great story line, and since the plot of this movie is truly pathetic, it does fulfil that description. to be interesting, such a movie must rely entirely on moving and intriguing characters, and on the chemistry between them. unfortunately the staff of feeling minnesota fails utterly in producing this excitement.the initializing presentation of the characters is unsatisfying and confusing; i can, for example, not figure out whether jjaks (keanu reeves) did grow up in the house of his mother and brother or not. it is said, by his mother (tuesday weld), that he must live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that it ever happens. the same goes for the rest of the characters - i never get to know them. they appear irrational, and no real explanation is given to why they do so.the bottom line is that i leave the movie without any feelings for the characters, except dullness and perhaps a tiny kick of attraction for the cute cameron diaz.

feeling minnesota, directed by steven baigelmann, and starring keanu reeves, cameron diaz and vincent d'onofrio: the strained relationship between two brothers, sam (d'onofrio) and jjaks (reeves), is pushed to breaking point when jjaks arrives at sam's wedding and makes off with the bride, freddie (diaz), a former stripper, marrying sam to repay a gambling debt owed to night-club owner red (lindo). baigelman's writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess, full of hateful characters and lacking coherence. putting keanu and diaz in the same movie should at least provide some eye candy, but baigelman even cops out on that score, grudging his actors up with little positive effect. very poor.

first of all, i think the casting and acting were excellent. the problem is the story. there is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movie here. larry mcmurtry has done lonesome dove and i can't fault the original, though it probably didn't need sequels. he did hud with paul newman, which is one of my favorite movies. mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song i hear him sing is an old buck owens song. the movie makes a big deal out of chicken farming. mellencamp's character has a good wife, and it's utterly stupid of him to stray from her. the incident with riding in the sliding cage is utterly stupid. maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country, but i never heard of it.

celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies (the cinema is littered with failed attempts), and one can go on and on speculating why john mellencamp never made it big as an actor. instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects, mellencamp dives right in playing the lead in "falling from grace", which he also directed, and the results are as awkward and unbecoming as that title. story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in the sticks, opening up old family wounds, boasts a screenplay by larry mcmurtry, but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly. the supporting cast is decent, including kay lenz (whom it's always nice to see), mariel hemingway and claude akins (who share the one really strong scene in the picture). as for john's acting, he doesn't look particularly comfortable, despite apparent efforts to make him look at home; he seems to be ducking the camera most of the time, and he never connects with the audience in an immediate way. *1/2 from ****

i love john's work as a singer, but the movie was dull and 'no worth the time' to view. i thought he did an 'ok' job at acting his part. when he says, "your having an affair with the ol' man", to his co-star, i kinda chuckled at his facial movements... or lack thereof. i would suggest the movie if you like john's music but not as a saturday night video. if you love his music, then the video has a little music from him in it, but not much. so so.. at best

i honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much. a friend of mine watches this and since i like sci-fi, i tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising, but in truth it really is a very boring show. the only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video game-like cgi-effects and the complete overuse of muppets. note that i call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets, not like the aliens they should be.speaking of which; the muppets and make-up effects are horribly overused in this show. you have this guy who could be best described as a alien/dwarf-hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp-girl, you've got a floating potty-mouth frog-alien... it just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronaut.every episode is also too much of a stand-alone. the creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show. at least up until the point that you see the main-characters/muppets again, that is. the whole plot about the main-character getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points. the acting is also quite bad.conclusion: if you want good sci-fi, just look somewhere else. this isn't even real sci-fi to begin with in my opinion, since the show is more aimed at fantasy-elements with all the puppetry and weird dreams going on. and if you just want to see muppets then i suggest you watch the muppet show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a end.by the way; doesn't anyone have dejavu's with the concept of a living spaceship? ohyeah thats right; doctor who started that concept almost about 30 years ago! this show is like a collection of 'sci-fi' leftovers. scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason, only to be picked up by this horrible show.

much praise has been lavished upon farscape, but i don't think it's that good. it certainly has a distinctive look, but it lacks just about everything else: story, purpose, direction, excitement; you name it. i'm a big sci-fi fan, and i make it a point to watch all the sci-fi shows i can. i've almost finished the four seasons of farscape, and at this point i'm not very satisfied. the show does have a few good things - most notably claudia black (who's sadly missing from the first few episodes of season four) -, but they are very few and very far between. as a whole the show is marred by a lot of very silly stuff (such as fantasy elements rather than sf ditto), and many many episodes, esp. in season four, are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured. and one just feels that it isn't going anywhere. it's mostly just non-directional adventures with thin, long-running plot lines which develop painstakingly slowly. well, sometimes it's a little bit tighter, but it only lasts for a very few episodes at a time.effects-wise, there are a few impressive things here and there (esp. out in space, occasionally), but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects, which frankly gets old fast. outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens mar the show a great deal, and i've come to prefer (by far) the episodes where regular human-looking characters are the focus.i think the peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show; they succeed in being a convincingly alien culture, despite their all-human appearance. there are a few really cool episodes with them, esp. in the first season (iirc), where crichton masquerades as a peacekeeper captain, and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases. such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10, but i cannot award the show as a whole more than a "4" rating.aside from the peacekeepers (which themselves are somewhat too single-mindedly totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced), the show simply doesn't offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see. otoh, it does contain a few good ideas and is not a total loss.this is just my opinion, of course, but as a seasoned sci-fi fan, i think it counts for something, and may be of help to others. there aren't a lot of good sci-fi shows out there; but star trek (any series) and especially the new battlestar galactica are definitely better than farscape. but if you're a huge fan of mediocre sci-fi shows, you may well like farscape, too.my rating: 4 out of 10.

this film had a couple of funny parts,but for the most part, made me want to go ahead and change dvd's and watch "malibu's" instead,which i had in my own collection. at least i would know there was something funny coming up and give me something to look forward to.i was disappointed in this very low budget film. and i do not judge a movie by it's budget.it just lacked originality and was too predictable. i would not rent or even watch this film again, and i am usually a repeat offender of film. the actors were forgettable. the story was half thought out, and it left me with an insatiable urge to get my laugh on.i ended up watching jamie kennedy's white boy gone gangsta to have the comedy itch scratched.

full disclosure: i was born in 1967. at first the premise tickled me -- after all, if you were a teenager growing up in the age of reagan, a trip down memory lane was worth a laugh or three. pop rocks, atari and rock 'em sock 'em robots? loved 'em, not *despite* the fact they were goofy, but *because* they were goofy and silly and fun. but when vh1 decided to make the series "i love last tuesday", i knew enough was enough. goes hal sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how idiotic slinkys are? (wait, let me check... hmmm, no. no, it appears he doesn't.) snarky, snotty uber-hip posturing has its place, but enough already!

big fat slob 'uncle buck', played by john (eats-a-lot-of) candy, visits the sane members of his family for a week in order to baby-sit two cute kids (gaby hoffman and maccauley culkin) and a pretty but snobby teenager (jean louisa kelly). the shenanigans begin when buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two sizes too small for his blimp of a body. mostly dull, but peppered with two or three funny scenes including buck trying to get a word in edge-wise on the telephone with his angry girlfriend (amy madigan) and his meeting with a very disgusting clown.candy looks like he weighs 600 pounds.

of the four main players in here - john candy, jean kelly, amy madigan and macauley caulkin - the only one i've never heard about (at that time) was the one that annoyed the heck out of me and ruined the film. well, she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to throw her and the vhs into the garbage pail. i am referring to kelly in the role of teenage brat, "tia russell." ironically, six years later she played a stunning and extremely likable role in the person of "rowena morgan" in "mr. holland's opus."candy, as usual, is fun to watch as "buck russell," or the title character, "uncle buck." few actors were better at playing a lovable, hapless slob than candy. i enjoyed his character in here, but i cannot watch that spoiled teen girl more than once. also, in the first few minutes of the film, the little boy "miles" (cauklin) says the word "g-damn." how bad is that, having a six-year-old kid saying the lord's name in vain on film? these hollywood people are such sickos. no wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally screwed up, caulkin being a case in point.

if you are looking for the feel-good hit of the summer, dark harvest 2 might just be your ticket. the production values of this movie are extremely high (looks as if it were filmed with a sony handicam and edited using imovie), especially the sound effects -- they sound straight off of a "spooky halloween sounds" cd! the scarecrow from the cover, although he doesn't appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance, is terrifyingly realistic! from beginning to end, you'll watch as a man aimlessly searches for his daughters through a, pun intended, maize! at the climactic ending of the movie you'll see, well...you'll have to watch for yourself.what i'm really trying to say here is, don't come within 1000 yards of this movie. i rented it because i thought it would be a campy sort of "troll 2" funny, but it's not. i cried after i watched this movie, because i realized i had spent money on it (and i found the $4 i spent on renting it). i actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on.

if you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money, go buy a bag of ice and watch it melt. that's more entertaining than this movie. bill cowell, shame on you. or if you wanna see this movie plot, go in a corn field, bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find, run around for a couple hours having the girls scream as loud as possible. then send me the couple bucks you woulda spent.i enjoyed the first dark harvest, after watching the sequel, i'm going to cry myself to sleep.

this has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. ok my impression (i had watched scarecrow on tv a weeks ago) perfect, a nice slasher film to start the evening with. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong i think 5 mins in i was gonna take it out, but thought i wasted 3$ on this so ill finish it wheres the scarecrow, well im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots. you see that every so often. i was watching this thinking.... ok when are those brats gonna run into this dude, at one point i thought they died. but no.... i mean frig, their still alive. i only chuckled at a few parts cause of how badly staged they were. one was the zoom in part at the start. the director/actor/writer says, "remember i had that feeling, well i have it again" and it was either a zoom in or zoom out, to hell i'm checking back. but i guess the scene was supposedly shocking, i mean whats more shocking is his wife had the same shocked look.... ok... she believed him??? im sorry but yeah.... i didn't know he was psychic until i read the movie box to make some sense out of what i witnessed. not only that, they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear. the other thing that made me laugh a bit was the, scream in the camera, to make it scary....... ok............... filming a girl close up screaming into the camera for 5 mins.......right..... i laughed cause of how pathetic it was these kids cannot act like the rest of the people in the movie.to top things off the scythe must have got lost or something.... cause seems the bad guy had just a stick. not even an ax, someone should axe the dam production filmdon't fall for the picture, this movie is a piece of sh*t. i watched the trailer and guess what it hasgirls where are you talk to me and corn

the first dh wasn't that great, but i really didn't expect it to be. but this horrible movie was just beyond criticism. i really try to look on the bright side and give movies like this a chance, but i just could not find a real good thing about this one. i appreciate what bill cowell was trying to do, but this movie was just soooooo boring. the story of the movie really isn't that bad. in fact, it's somewhat original. but the movie form is really as bad as a lot of people say. in my opinion, this one ranks right up there with "the off season", and "dracula 3000". i know a lot of people really trash and put down movies like this, but i really can't think of any other good things to say about it.

after sitting through the trainwreck that was the first dark harvest movie, i couldn't leave bad enough alone. upon seeing that there was a sequel (or rather what i believed to be a sequel)i had to increase my pain level. seeing that this had nothing to do with dark harvest, that should have been a good thing. we didn't get any killer scarecrows in this one, instead we got a jackass walking around a cornfield screaming out little things like, "girls!" and "can you hear me?" every so often. plus we got two (four if you include the two girls that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in the shining) obnoxious little girls who couldn't act. and the cherry on top of this mess would have to be the corn cop. i should have known this movie was going to be terrible when the dog got an opening credit. how i managed to stay awake through this movie, i'll never know.

this...thing. oh god this thing. i can't even call it a movie. a movie is something that does something. goes somewhere. has some semblance of a plot or something. i don't know how i'm doing it. i really don't. first i say dark fields is the worst movie ever. and i thought it was. then pirates of ghost island proved me wrong. and now, third time in a row, another film goes above and beyond the call of duty to prove me wrong.(sighs) ok. dark harvest ii: the maize. lord this is awful. let me break it down for you. man senses daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers he got from his act ii popcorn apparently and races to find them in a corn field. of course this is the hugest cornfield in all of existence, being the size of the cornfields from jeepers creepers, children of the corn, and signs combined. the main character, whose name is shy (awesome name btw) then runs through a corn field....finds some ghost girls, talks to them, and...runs through a corn field. digs a while...and runs through a corn field. and the incredibly sad thing? i'm really not leaving anything out. that pretty much is the entire movie. the only thing i may be leaving out is how he gets chased by two policemen who want to arrest him for... i don't know. pretending to be an actor. i didn't care by this point. he gets away and the police are -somethinged- by the killer offscreen. holy crap there's a killer? apparently yes there is as he's introduced nearly 4/5 into the movie. but wait! then he runs away for a while and there's, you guessed it, more running through the corn field and digging. then there's the ending where he saves his daughters. huzzah.the biggest problem with this movie is, it's boring. it's incredibly, inhumanly, tremendously boring. i can't explain how atrociously dull this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as appealing as a root canal, and it's just an hour and a half of nothing. the only good thing that came out of this movie was that me and my friend may have found enlightenment due to the near nirvana state this movie put us into after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to kick into overdrive to keep us alive. during the ensuing insanity, i found hugging a wall much more enjoyable and my friend found a new passion for laughing hysterically while flopping all over the floor as if he having a seizure. this is the sort of insanity this movie brings. it's not just bad. it's bad for your health. the cover looks awesome with a picture of an awesome scarecrow killer that i would totally consider dressing up as for a horror con, but this was the most misleading box ever. don't let it fool you too! do not watch this movie. watch a better corn movie. any movie about corn is better. just don't let it get you! don't! a 0 out of 10

just above the box i am typing in now, i was required to pick a number between 1 and 10, and rate this feature film. unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero, and i have to put something. if i had my choice i would just put nothing, no number, because there exist no digits that express the worthlessness of this movie.if you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the film.i don't know how this film was released to the public, it should be locked up and guarded 24/7 somewhere in fort knox. i am angry that this film was even available for me to watch. i feel cheated by humanity, i had no idea humans could be this cruel. stalin, saddam and hitler got nothing on this douche bag cowell.do not be fooled by the movie's cover. 1) there are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front. 2)none of the characters on the back of case are even in the stinking movie! 3) the tag line says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no frigging victims no one even died. we don't know if the dam cop died, and i'm assuming the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a frigging whiffle ball bat.do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. that's right four, it took an hour for me to watch it (i fast forwarded thru the 4 minute zooming scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over, contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap, and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it.

the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it. but i soon learned that i had been duped. i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip/eurotrip/american pie deal. but i was wrong. this movie is one of the dumbest i've seen in a long time. the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you. the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building. go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead. i can't believe national lampoon put its name on this. don't buy it, don't rent it. don't waste 2 hours of your life on this.

this movie actually hurts to watch. not only did i not laugh once, i ended up getting a serious headache. at times, i felt so sorry for the actors involved. the best way to sum it up is to note that among sex comedies, it is probably the least funny and least sexy of all time. i'm only sorry i can't give it a vote of less than one. to give this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or better.now i see that they're filming a sequel. hearing that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie convinces me that there's just too much money in hollywood. raise their taxes!!! making a sequel to this movie may very well constitute a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal should be convened, or u.n. sanctions applied to the filmmakers.in short, it's a really bad movie. really, really.

i have little to no interest in seeing another awful movie, that totally lacks anything new creative or funny, abusing the national lampoon tag. how ever something caught my eye in the cast of this movie. i see danielle fishel's name i'm a big fan of boy meets world! but the movies shes in are awful. more so as a fan i'm not rewarded by seeing her terrible movies with the treasure of bare breast. so this is where my question comes in.has anyone seen this movie? and if so does danielle fishel get naked in it? would save me the 2 hours of my life i would never get back watching this terrible movie. thanks a lot

me and a buddy rented this movie the other day. at first look, it seemed to be another teen movie, which was also what we hoped for, being fans of simple horror and comedy.it seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. it quickly accelerates into something that holds a lot of potential. unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground. we had watched it for something that seemed like 1 hour, when i finally, half-sleeping, managed to say :"dude, this movie sucks" it was only 35 minutes actually... dude agreed.the problem is: the movie is simply not funny. it was undoubtedly supposed to be funny, but it failed. it failed in a way that made me sad. it kind of reminds me of myself. i had the potential to be anything i wanted, and instead i ended up watching cheap horror/funny movies all the time. i pity the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart. its so sad. all that potential.. and nothing.

when i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny. the picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers (such as road trip)which i thought would be worth watching. when i turned the move on i was disappointed as the jokes were awful and cheesy. the only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody slipping over on a wet floor. this is not a joke and would not make people laugh. i actually considered turning this movie off coming to half way through. i was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it out. not enough care was taken making this film and not enough time and work put into it. i found the acting to be quite bad as well. the only time i laughed was at the extremely bad 'jokes'or actions done which were really not funny!!!. i rate this film a 1/10. i hope you found this comment useful.

worthless movie. a complete waste of time and nothing what i expected it to be. the packaging makes it seem as if it is of the american pie genre (it isn't). rather it is a ridiculous stringing together of coincidences that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise (let's try to see how many mix ups we can write in to make what should have been a bad snl skit into a full length feature presentation). what is remarkable is that the director's (based on their commentary on the dvd) take themselves completely seriously. i have been a huge fan of the movies that national lampoon lends its name to, up to and including van wilder. with this one, i feel completely cheated. in fact, i feel duped. i was expecting a van wilder like farce to relive my college days but instead was served an hour and a half of garbage. what lead to my ultimately unmet expectations? well, for starters, the fact that the cast all appear naked (with an enormous sausage covering what must be covered) on the cover of the dvd. add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking this is a movie that it is not. to make matters worse, the movie starts off as one might expect it too with half-naked drunk college students feebly trying a photo stunt, but ultimately this has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie. in fact, i didn't even realize that the people in that opening sequence where supposed to be the characters in the movie until i was told so by the directors in the commentary. don't get me wrong, i love plot twists and being surprised by movies, but i hate the fact that this movie tries to pawn itself off as something it is not. ultimately, it does itself a huge disservice (artistically, though most likely not financially) because it sets its audience up for confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to deliver what it advertises. in short, do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case. it is not your usual national lampoon movie. the only thing funny about it is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and tv shows that make their involvement here entertaining.

this has to be one of the biggest misfires ever...the script was nice and could have ended a lot better.the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade. maybe hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director.sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad.if i had to re-watch it it would be like torture. i don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with mine so..my advice is watch the movie first..see if u like it and after vote(do not vote before you watch it ! ) and by the way... have fun watching it ! don't just peek...watch it 'till the end :))))))))) !!

this movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. how many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you cram into just one movie? notes are misplaced, bags are switched, conversations are misheard, people get mixed up, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people are supposed to laugh about something. the writers are really struggling to keep everything going, which makes the dialogues feel really forced. if anyone in this movie acted like a real person all this would be resolved in around two minutes or so and everyone could go back to their lives, but they have to keep the misunderstandings going. at times this movie also tries to go for some juvenile laughs, but all those do is remember you about how funny "american pie" was. the scene with the nerd telling the hooker (who he thinks is a foreign exchange student) to "eat his sausage" goes on forever, not one second of it is funny. i've got to give this movie some credit though: because of the subplot about stolen money, it's not as boring as it could have been. it also has a laugh here and there, but then sadly goes back to yet another character misunderstanding stuff. overall this movie is just way too lame.

jeez, when i heard this movie was a national lampoons i thought it was going to be awesome, but i really got a say it was a rather disappointment. i have seen the most movies they've made, from christmas vacation to van wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in their name,, really bad actors and a to much intense movie. this movie is probably good to watch if you are watching it with a crowd of worked up people and the ability to laugh at it, but if you are into good comedy's like i am, i do not suggest this movie, i would much rather watch van wilder a second or third time, than to watch this movie... you have been warned.

national lampoon's dorm daze is easily the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen the movie kazaam. anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way, shape, or form has no idea what a good movie is, and should never watch another movie again because they are indeed so stupid.its hard to name everything wrong with this movie. first off, the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the multiple "misunderstandings" very well at all. the acting is awful to say the least, and the whole thing was poorly made. any and all who worked on this movie should not be in another movie of any kid ever again!it is too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two, because it is so bad, but for anyone out there reading this please do not watch this movie!! if you want a good movie to watch, go turn on anything else on television. even u.s.a. has better movies than this._friend.

the palestinian situation is fertile and as-yet largely fallow soil for film-making. 'divine intervention' tries hard, and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles, but the film amounts to little more than a handful of (admittedly lovely) visual jokes thrown onto celluloid, while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses. a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue.

won't be long on this movie. the first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies. the story didn't advanced, nothing was explained about any of the characters. it felt like a non-movie. (a lot of people had already left the audience at this point).a lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplained.the director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence, each scene, has to make the story go forward. he never did that.the supposedly funny moments were contrived, and only a few people laughed (people with a weird sense of humor, i guess).prize of the jury in cannes 2002.....don't know what the jury was thinking about....probably the "politicly correct effect".i would have loved to love it, the disappointment was therefore even bigger.you have to see it to believe it. but wait for the video.

this is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep.utterly boring long silent(yes, silent) strings of unrelated video clips.instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow- it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing arabs being malicious to everyone around them.sulieman (the director) should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film.it deserves a one for the movie quality, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or lack thereof.)

a brazilian cable television is presenting "yadon ilaheyya" this month in its "cult" channel. i saw the trailer and listened to the advertisement, and decided to see this movie. indeed it is an absurd boring pretentious dumb pointless disconnected crap about the conflict in the middle east, and together with "soultangler", they certainly are the worst movies i have tried to see. i really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap, highly indicated for torturing enemies. how can this movie be awarded and nominated to prizes inclusive in cannes? my vote is one (awful).title (brazil): "intervenção divina" ("divine intervention")

i was very concerned about this film, it was scheduled to play at a jewish film festival, and was reported to be very hostile to israel, while using clever humor and irony.i was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing. the film was full of random events, some of which eventually connected, most of which did not. some of the events were very clever and funny, but some were merely random and pointless.there are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car, wordlessly, and play some handholding game. perhaps in some cultures this is erotic, but it's like watching thumb-wrestling. after the third time, it really became tiresome.i have always found david lynch to be gratuitously bizarre, using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is so sophisticated that they don't grasp his work; in fact, there is nothing to grasp. the same is true here, the stories do not add up to anything, and there is not much of a political point being made (in one scene a boisterous israeli soldier humiliates palestinian drivers at a checkpoint. that's news?)i don't understand why this film has garnered controversy, nor why it has garnered attention. it is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time.

i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons -- the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works (e.g. linda grant's when i lived in modern times)usually from the israeli side of the fence. also, a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year, so with such a recommendation...however i actually found myself nodding off at points! admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters. once i'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes, i went with it, but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film. i liked the concept of a restrained, almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter. but personally i think the film has been over hyped. i'm not saying narrative and plot is everything (it's definitely not) but even a little more dialogue would have helped.

this was one of the most dishonest, meaningless, and non-peaceful of the films i have ever seen. the representation of the other, of the israelis, was racist, backward, and unfair. for one, the song played on e.s' car radio when pulled up alongside a very right-wing israeli driver was "i put a spell on you" by natacha atlas. the song's style is quite arabic, but it was released on an israeli compilation cd, and i have even heard it on the radio in israel. many israeli songs (as well as architecture, foods, and slang) are influenced by arabic culture, and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song. the way e.s. appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare, via a long, still shot, is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as haggard and racist, and e.s. as noble and temperate.i have traveled all over israel, and i have never seen an idf recruitment poster, since service is mandatory. but in the film, not only is there a recruitment poster, but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words "want to shoot?" this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of israelis as well as israeli soldiers, and such an "advertisement" wouldn't even exist on a random israeli highway. in including it, the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of anti-arab racists hell-bent on murder.the ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent. a hollywood-style action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an israeli-directed film as the ninja scene should have been. but for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic, and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the israeli side so much beforehand, that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome. the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges, portraying the "other" as human, or working towards peace; violence is made to be the only solution. this is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks, falling guard towers, and other random acts of destruction. one of my best friends serves in the israeli military, and the targets in firing ranges are never arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning shout, fire into the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the proper procedure.besides these inaccuracies, the directing style was also poor. repetition became repetitious, and no longer captivating. symbols, such as the balloon with arafat drawn on it, are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting; the balloon is palestine penetrating and regaining jerusalem, and it is created for no reason by e.s. the ambulance being checked for permits by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overly-overt claim of an israeli double standard by the director. the attempt by the director to show life in nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill; showing the routines of random people over and over again, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes, the dreariness of life, without allowing much room for personal interpretation. by contrasting one "section" of the movie, daily life in nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between ramallah and israel, the director subtly blames this dreariness on israel, but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued.i spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly, and why many modern fashion-show-like and metal-action tracks were included in the score. i still cannot come up with an answer. i felt that the music was out of place in this film; the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought-provoking. i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes, but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja, or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint, albeit defiantly. in fact, i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes, and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes. whatever the director's intent, it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the film.this film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other, and neglects to actually address any issues. it is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side, while displaying the israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by palestinians against israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side. there is no thought, reflection, or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience; emotions are simply pulled to one side, and kept there, in a "good vs bad" cliché scenario. i believe this film lacked the depth, quality, and power of other palestinian films, such as "paradise now" and "wedding in the galilee."

it's not plot driven, ok; it's not a character study, fine; there's no action, alright; there's no point, hmmm...maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in palistine and parts of israel these days in a state of violence, petty disagreements, deep rooted hostility, etc. but mostly it's long, long scenes of nothing happening - or things which look like they're dripping with meaning (a checkpoint tower crashing to the ground, an arafat balloon floating into jerusalem, a crouching tiger women deflecting bullets into a halo) but when you try to derive some meaning, there's no there there.bonus: you can watch this film in fast forward and it will make absolutely no difference except that it might be slightly less boring.

did i waste my time. this is very pretentious film. in the beginning you will think there's something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening. i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people. unbelievably boring pointless film. stay away. so many good soundtracks. i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me. i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film. stay away.1 on 10.

how many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime?well i'll go out on a limb and say one.this movie is better watched late at night,with a 12 pack of beer, the sound off and you and your friends making up the dialogue.on a pacific island a young man is sentenced to death for consorting with the "evil americans".(seems his loving wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they set him up to die so the doc' can be king).well he vows to come back and wreak revenge.before you can shake a stick the goofy natives run to the american scientists' hut screaming"tobanga come!"it seems the young corpse has done just that as tobanga, the walking tree monster. yes his revenge is terrible (and so is this movie).it seems that these natives cannot run from a lumbering tree so he tosses them in quicksand,rolls them down hills etc.pretty soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom for an axe or a chainsaw.general problems with this movie are numerous. the comedy relief is an obnoxious woman with a cockney accent (like this movie needs comedy).you want her to die upon her first appearance.the leading lady is whiny.the leading man is a boor.the acting is wooden (pun intended).the dialogue is stiff and lumbering.the natives have brooklyn accents.the monster suit is pure giggles.while this is a bad movie it still is fun to watch.it gets a 3 on unintentional laughs alone.your dog may rate it just a bit higher but only if the tree wasn't mobile.

**may contain spoilers**a luckless south sea islander is executed by other (caucasian-looking) natives after he befriends visiting scientists tod andrews and tina carver. the meddlesome scientists dig him up and find that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree. he comes to life and goes on a rampage and sure enough, that fifties boogeyman, the a-bomb, is blamed for this aberration. to state that this particular monster walks like it has a stick up its a** would be redundant. suffice it to say that the critter lumbers along, like the film itself, throwing his enemies into some handy quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments about. paul blaisdell created the tree-man suit and it's hardly his best work. over the years this flick has been sujected to many comments like "to hell it can go!" personally i think it's the best walking-tree movie i've ever seen.

i know it's not original, but what the hey? what else can be said about it? i feel unutterably silly just paying any attention at all to "from hell it came". the movie makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests seem a matter for joking and dismissal, not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time.

native chief's son is wrongfully accused for the death of his father. the evil witch doctor orders to execute him. he then comes back as a murdering tree(!), tabanga. well, what can you say about such a "film"? if it was intended to be a horror film, there obviously was some sort of bad judgment involved. and for a comedy, it still isn't funny enough. i don't know why people make films like this. i guess you have to be in a really silly mood to watch it. or you might want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree, which gives a new dimension to "a slow death". or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills by all involved. (ms. kilgore!) or the dialogue and screenplay, which were strangely ignored at the academy awards that year."shouldn't we try psycho-analysis on that tree? maybe its mother was afraid of oaks." 2/10

in this horrible attempt at a blair witch mockumentary, a bunch of people go to africa to investigate a creature called the half-caste. it's pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of, and that everything was improvised. that can work if you have good actors, which this film didn't. this movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture. as a result, there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do "quirky african stuff" like eating elephant dung. there is also some pretty good footage of lions eating (from a national geographic perspective) but there's not a single scare in the whole movie. if you've seen cannibal holocaust or the blair witch project, this movie will hold no surprises for you, and you can probably watch better lion footage on the discovery channel.definitely a half- aste effort. a note to the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time save the "how i spent my african vacation" home movie for your family and close friends. nobody else wants to see it.

this film is what happens when people see like in this particular one blair witch project and say hell people running around with cameras, acting slash documentary themed no problemo i can do it and start out with a lame idea make up a terrible script and get a bunch of talentless actors and start shooting a film. plot is that in africa there a halfcaste a breed of man like animals who hunt and kill humans, the locals think that it's a demon or a evil spirit but our wild bunch are in africa to get some proof of there own. no need for more words on the plot this movie get's a 1 out of 10 and i am trying to find something good to say about this movie but after a long time thinking nothing nada zero null.

aside from the gunfight scene, i felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. robert duvall, kevin costner, and annette bening could have played those roles in their sleep. the dialog was marginally tolerable (and there was plenty of it--no one sat together quietly in this movie), the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to cram into the story, there was no subtlety at all--foreshadowing hit you between the eyes and they led you by the nose through most of the story (i think they added all the dialog to make sure you didn't miss anything), and the editing really needed tightening up (each actor's screen time was more quantity than quality--again, too much dialog).the entire story took place over the course of a few days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions, much like how day-to-day happenings seemed huge to you in high school, but in the grand scheme really weren't that important. yes, the bad guys beat up and killed mose, they beat up button, they killed the dog--all things which would get boss and charley's blood up. but the importance was diluted by all of the "deep, meaningful" conversations which dominated most of the movie. these guys worked together for 10 years and they're just now talking about this stuff? the only time there wasn't much dialog was in the gunfight scene--which is probably why i liked it.finally, someone give annette bening a hairbrush! the wispy strands of hair around her face that were (i suppose) to make her look a bit more romantic actually made her look a little deranged. if she worked outside the home, it would have made more sense. plus, why wasn't she married already? there seemed to be several "kind and gentle" (her words) single men in town aside from the marshal and his cronies. in fact, none of the bad guys seemed to want her either (a usual plot device in other movies). she stayed cooped up in the house most of the time and really didn't seem to have much connection to the people in town. makes you wonder......in all, the movie was entirely too long, too chatty, and too contrived for me. it felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for the big stars, but not enough character depth to interest me, despite all of the dialog.

cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term "video nasties". this was a notorious british list containing all the films that could bring 'damage' to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences (dramatization). for gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies (faces of death, cannibal holocaust, driller killer) as well as outrageous and ultra-sick horror films (the burning, nightmare city, the toolbox murders). keeping this in mind, it's quite unusual to see "night of the bloody apes" listed among the other "nasties". it sure is gorybut the blood and violence are so poorly presented i can't imagine anyone would be offended by it. and the silly plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla's heart into the chest of his dying son) isn't exactly what you would call disturbingly real, neither. all that remains is a fairly amusing pulp-horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze. the man-ape make up effects are laughable and there's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. enjoyable only if you're in the right mood, in other words. the few sequences showing detailed matches of lady-wrestling (which one of the lead-actresses does for a living) are very cool.

acclaimed argentine horror director emilio vierya directs a script from jack curtis and antonio ross. cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method to the madness. a doctor's son is nearing his early death, until his desperate father transplants an ape's heart into his chest. as expected, things are going to get weird; when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams the beaches scouting out nice looking party girls to make his slaves. when heroin is injected, his beauties become zombies. the monster summons his dazed minions with strange organ music. so bad...well...it's just bad. in the cast: jose e. moreno, alberto caneau, mauricio de ferraris, gloria prat and gina moret.

dr. krellman wants to save his son julio who's dying of heart disease. he decides a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son (no--i'm not kidding). he does the transplant and (somehow) his son changes from a frail guy into a muscle-bound man with a dime store mask that (sort of) resembles an ape! naturally he gets out, kills men, tears the clothes of women and wreaks havoc. this is all inter cut with the boring romance of police lt. arturo martinez and lady wrestler lucy ossorio. we also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot. it all ends by copying the end of "king kong"! this is (obviously) a pretty stupid movie. the plot makes little sense, there's the gratuitous female nudity (a staple of any exploitation film) and very graphic gore that looks laughably fake (except for the open heart transplant). still this does have merit. the whole cast takes everything dead serious and actually aren't too bad as actors. also the dubbed in dialogue was (for a film like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing. also i saw an excellent dvd print with bright strong color (which helps). we're not talking a classic here but an ok exploitation movie.

when i heard disney had the rights to "underdog",i figured at the very least it would be a cool pixar partnership affair,and we'd get a great adults & kids film like "the incredibles". alas...i forgot how disney must dumb down classic material for today's dumbed down youth. what were they thinking? "underdog" was a product of the 60's,your prime fanbase is in their 40's and 50's,why would you refocus it to 5 year olds? it should have been done ala "roger rabbit",half animated half real. instead we get characters like riff raff ( a wolf!! ) dumbed into another dog."underdog" can't have an "energy pill",as we're now so "enlightened" it would obviously be a steroid or drugs reference.the only good casting was patrick warburton as "cad" because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version. otherwise,old school "underdog" fans should avoid this like the plague it is. what next? a live action version of "the go-go gophers" disguised as a re-visionist history lesson? ( my advanced apologies if disney jumps on this! )

only three words are really required for this review: piece of crap.if you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child, you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money. the best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor.yes, they do use all of the names and catch phrases. the even name the dog "shoeshine" (in reference to the dog being "shoeshine boy" in the cartoon). they name the love interest polly, but she isn't miss sweet polly purebred.my wife and son drug me to see this. they should have drugged me to see it.the original underdog was voiced by wally cox, the ultimate nerd. this one is voiced by someone with a "smart alleck teenager that knows more than all the adults" attitude.as a stand alone movie, it is awful. as an homage to underdog, it is even worse. it is not an homage. it is not a retelling of the story. it is not an updating of the story. it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising. the next time i go to the store, i fear that i will see underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothing, etc. mcdonalds and burger king probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this.the worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack. they do the underdog theme song to rap (read that with a silent "c" at the beginning)! great, now that we are going to destroy something, let's go all the way.i knew that it would probably be bad before i went. my fears were confirmed when i arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without stadium seating). even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage! save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on dvd. it will be more entertaining and have better production values.

i was browsing through the movies on demand and saw underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes long so i decided to watch it. i wasn't expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful. everything about the movie was cringe worthy. the dialogue was atrocious including many terrible puns. the jokes were also terrible. i found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while i was suffering through this trash. it hit its target audience very well but i don't see how anyone else could enjoy this film. it made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it.the only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a 1/10 after viewing it. i beg you to avoid it at all costs. i understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all.

i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march, i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly. sure it was a cheesy idea, but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work, hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it? then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck, the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible, but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good. still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today, as i entered my screen i was mortified, it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen! little did i know for what i was about to endure. underdog to put it blunt is horrendous, it really is. imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse, that is just how pathetic the movie is. while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie. matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre, the acting is generally poor, and the movie just feels like an over-long, tired and downright boring saturday cartoon! after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale. i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released, it's an embarrassment to disney, hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this! what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel!so lets get onto the acting (cracks knuckles). okay let me be honest jason lee is decent, his voice suits the canine, and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work. however, with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder. in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield, murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable. then we get onto the human actors, and well the majority of atrocious. alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog, jack. my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition. the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor. not once did i believe he was a real person, in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie! james belushi seems half dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, no decent lines, he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot, which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable. thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie, he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role. he steals every scene he is in, although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton. the rest of the cast are even worse, especially taylor momsen, she just needs to end her acting career right now!underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene. when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong. this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story, alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms. the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd, and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers. what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super? the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness, the dog flies, other stuff happens, some stuff gets chucked about, all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening. the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst. when someone says "look its a plane, no its a bird, no its a frog...", yes you read that right, i just wanted to burst into tears there and then. actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point, this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully.overall underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 at this early period, and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie. luckily for underdog, meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse. so in case you didn't get the point of my review, avoid the film at all costs, if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, just do not see this!

good things out of the way first:underdog's voice acting was fine. but jason lee being awesome himself, that really is no surprise.peter dinklage (barsinister) also did fine, for what trash was given to him. he acted the part shockingly well. and so did patrick warburton, the moronic assistant. now, it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well, i actually liked the character better than the protagonists. the lines given to him were childish but witty.however. alex neuberger did awful and hope he never acts again. his "scream" was so disgustingly fake. silence. silence. "aaahhhhhhh". in the scene where he hears the dog talk, an "oh no, impossible!" would have sufficed in place of the pathetic fake scream.and then there was the girl and her female dog that chased patrick's character cad on the roof. at first this makes sense, she's a "reporter." a school reporter but still an inquiring mind regardless. but why, why the hell did she carry her dog around? that was worthless and the damn dog didn't even say anything other than a heartless "oh, underdog!" her presence was extremely unnecessary.overall, the script was pathetic. the only reason i give this movie a 3 is barsinister, his assistance, and underdog's voice.

god, i never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this crap. there are so many ways to describe this piece of crap, that i think that if i said everything that came to mind, i would get banned by this site.how do i begin? well, for one, it doesn't take knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of people who've seen it. the biggest butchering of a theme song ever made is here, from a metal version, to a freaking rap version, what were they thinking? how does underdog and a electronic-heavy musical style match? the story is so basic, that i will do something i don't usually do and not even give a summary. just think this: a dog gets superpowers, fill in the rest. that's how predictable this movie is. and then comes the jokes....please kill me now. this style of humor that might not even get the kids laughing, it's that bad, well, expect that punch line after the sneezing. that was slightly funny.but what surprises me the most is why jason lee(ny name is earl), patrick warburton(emperor's new groove), and jim belushi(according to jim) are all here. in the shows/movies i mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job, and, excluding lee, are the best actors in this movie, but that says very little. the rest deserve golden rasberry nominations for this crap. i am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster.all in all, this is just as bad as doogal, which i reviewed as well, and again, my head would explode if i saw anything worse than this.

wow, where to begin with this one. well, if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers, then this one is for you. i bought this movie for 5 bucks because i never pass up an opportunity to laugh at b-movie god casper van dien's blunders, and boy was this one of them. it may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever. this thing, which is supposed to be an indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on halloween. he dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped bonnet over his head. at some points this is a man in costume, at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse. this monster has the uncanny ability to see with "predator" vision, a clear rip-off, and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear. sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes it doesn't. this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow. wow, this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of "critters." this creature is impervious to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. at the end of his killing spree, which we never really find out why he is on, he gets blown up. this is an incredible feat, for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film. but, i guess this last time was the charm. and don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. first of all, what delta force unit employs women? last i checked the military still disallows women into combat situations. also, this unit is "undercover." why? what possible reason would they have to be undercover? and they're not even good at it, i guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms, but they were all carrying machine guns (which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film, at some points sounding like air rifle bb guns, and at others, canons). there is one part when the skeleton man throws some construction workers from a catwalk, and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto. at another point. michael rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground. they tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline, but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. then when he is helped back up the hill, the rope is flat, and when it shows the woman at the "top" of the "hill" the rope goes upward from her grip, not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill. rooker actually has a line that says, "i'm not going after him, i going after it." what? that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard, and i watch these bad movies as a hobby. the saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing/production of this film thought that it was so bad-ass. believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialog, this is good. the acting, bad. the makeup, really bad. these characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face. maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face. yeah, i think i'll make a movie about that, "attack of the alien scars that move around on your face." that villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man, and the film would probably be scarier.

where to start? some guy has some indian pot that he's cleaning, and suddenly skeletor attacks. he hits a woman in the neck with an axe, she falls down, but then gets up and is apparently uninjured. she runs into the woods, and it turns out there's the basement of a shopping center out there in the woods. she meets a utility worker and skeletor attacks again. luckily, like any good utility worker, he's got a gun and shoots at the guy. doesn't work, everything starts on fire.cut to some people walking through the woods. even though they've been hiking together for some time, they sit down and introduce themselves to each other. wouldn't they have probably done that when they first met? anyhow, they're "undercover" delta team members (undercover, i suppose, because that way they don't have to pay to dress them in uniforms). the cute girls are various things such as a sniper school instructor and, oh, i can't remember the rest. it doesn't matter. eventually they all take their guns out and immediately start aiming them at various things. ? anyhow, they meet an old indian who is sitting out in the woods. he wants beans. you know, like pork and beans? he mumbles some stuff, i can only assume that it's the premise of the movie. i relied on having heard the premise from the commercials, because you can't really understand anything he says.so, they walk around the woods some more. all the dialogue is a load of quasi-military, macho bs. i mean all of it, as in every single word. like "this reminds me of when we were in kabul" or "this reminds me of when we were in laos". skeletor attacks again. let me give you a rundown of a basic attack. one of the female characters is crouched behind a tree and she aims her gun at the approaching guy on the horse. for some reason, she doesn't fire but yells several times for someone else. then as skeletor approaches, she jumps out from behind the tree so that skeletor can stick her with his spear. then everybody starts shooting. the bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees. apparently the folks who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet. they don't make sparks.then casper van diem is all of a sudden driving a semi-truck, trying to run over skeletor. he misses, and the truck slides to a stop. van diem is injured, apparently he slid across the seat and bumped his hip on the window crank or something, so he crawls out of the truck and it explodes. later he's in the woods dying and everybody says a bunch of quasi-military, macho bs. they meet a couple guys in the woods and blow their "undercover" status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the army. they beat on the guys for some reason, then they go away.some other stuff happens, people mumble, the camera shakes, etc.i think it comes to an end eventually.my theory is that the sci-fi channel is getting a little annoyed with everyone bashing their movies, so they put this out to remind us all how bad movies can really be. like, you think our movies are bad? well, you haven't seen bad. here's bad!!! okay, now that we've got that out of the way, the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison, right?well, it's just a theory.

this movie tries to rip off predator, but that movie is much better. this movie has truly terrible special effects and a mindless plot. the team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearances of military and scientist is a combo of rough and rugged male delta commandos and pretty but tough female rangers. none of them are too bright. all the characters seem to be more than willing to run off into the forest alone and headfirst into a spear or sword and their death. some of the pyrotechnics are very big and must have cost a bundle. but the close-ups of the creature are laughable as are most of the death scenes. every cliché that the writers could think of was used. if you're looking for a mindless slaughter fest, this may fill the bill. the night i watched this was very slow so i sat through the whole thing. i have to admit that it's been a while since i watched something this bad. there is very little to redeem this movie. i'm amazed that junk like this gets produced.

this was so bad, i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it.first off, the acting was uniformly bad. there was barely a plot, unless "shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" counts.the editing was was all over the place, and the slow-mo shots of the "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air--doubtless flung using a spoon) got irritating after the tenth time, and infuriating after the hundredth time.i like michael rooker. he's done some good work. this was not good. this was less than good. and by that, i mean that it sucked. hard.for god's sake, don't watch this movie.

wow. i thought, eskimo limon was the most awful and embarrassing first-sex movie ever. but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete. in this case, the well-known german film producer bernd eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap. harte jungs is stupid, not believable and predictable, and above all: not funny. it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany (and, i'm afraid, also austria).tobias schenke, 19, looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15, and his character is too dumb to be true. schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex, but that doesn't help. harte jungs seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously.the best actors in the movie are sissi perlinger and stefan jürgens who play schenke's semi-liberal parents. perlinger and jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting. still, their performances are the `best' and `funniest' in comparison.a complete failure.

one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s. i'd often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films; "at least it wasn't as bad as caro diario." three absolutely pointless segments, all featuring the director playing himself -- and he's not that interesting. a whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor. another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter. for three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous ones.the only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to keith jarrett's 'koln concert'. prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album. the best thing you can say about the director/actor/egotist is that he's got great taste in music.

this film is boring, boring, boring, boring, and boring!!! it's not the worse film i ever saw, on the contrary, but.......how shall i put this.......it's boring! there is some very nice scenery and some clever dry wit but that's about it. if it was advertised as a travelogue i would rate it a 7 but it's supposed to be a film with a plot, some drama, and for god's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion.i read some of the comments on this board about this films and i wondered if they saw the same movie as i did.see this film (yawn) at your own risk........one thing for sure- it really is rated correctly= g rating! (which most stand for god awful boring!)

tandem is an odd slice in the japanese pink genre-as it has the requisite sex-scenes and misogynistic tone that is all but required for these types of films-but also throws in a disjointed drama/dark-comedy storyline that seems like it'd have been better suited for a different type of film. the film starts with two lone guys at a restaurant-each daydreaming about a previous sexual encounter. one is a mutual subway groping, the other a pretty typical (for this type of film) semi-rape scenario. the two pervs meet and start talking after one lends the other a cigarette. they hang out for an evening and talk a bit about their respective sex- lives. the film is inter-cut with flashback scenes of both of the men's interactions with the women that are central in their lives. the two men have a falling out and the film ends on a weird but predictable note... i really don't know what to make of tandem. it sorta comes off as a soft-core, 'odd couple' type of anti-buddy-film, but doesn't really explore the subject-matter to any satisfying degree. there's also not much of the typical extreme sleaziness often so prevalent in these types of films-so i can't really figure out what the point was. i also cant quite tell if the film was supposed to be funny, depressing, or both.  i think that tandem could have had some potential as a more serious drama film with a dark-comedy edge- but as a soft-core sex film that tries to be too 'smart' for its own good-it just doesn't work.   can't say i hated this one-but can't say there's anything notable about it either. 4/10 

oh boy! i really trashed manhunt in space. i think this flopper deservedly rates worse than manhunt. it goes nowhere and fungi growth was more exciting than this tripe.poor cleolanta. she's so misunderstood. smug rocky struts around and thankfully, there's no mention from winky about his "gay nightlife". there's a lot more talking, a really awful (to watch) space marriage on the rocks, and crappy space effects cut-outs. then, there's bobby. you decide who's more annoying: bobby or the winkster? personally, i'd jettison them out of an airlock into a black hole not before first subjecting them to killer flesh eating alien mutants.at least there's vena. she's just a cosmic girl!

i bought this movie for a couple of dollars at a "clearance warehouse sale" one day when just looking around. the cover looked pretty good, (in colour), but the movie is b&w, (i wish they wouldn't try to trap us with coloured covers on b&w movies, but it's a common thing to look out for!).when i watched it i was pleasantly surprised. it turned out to be better than i expected. i was disappointed that it was a b&w, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than, say, "invaders from mars" which has crappy effects, and it is great to see john banner in something else apart from hogan's heroes.overall, this movie isn't too bad for a b grade, and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view. it isn't my favourite sci-fi, but it's not my worst either. it's o.k.

by all appearances this serial could have been made any time since the mid forties. the cardboard sets, the moon kings with lightning bolts sewn onto their aprons, you know the drill. this one is a rocky jones adventure, featuring the space cop's dealings with the insufferable bitch queen of planet offeecious, a commie planet that won't join the united planets. when the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that offeecious is on a collision course with this other, vaguely slavic planet, bitch queen decides to blow the other guys up rather than evacuate her land. this introduces a moral to the effect of "the greatness of a nation is not in its land, but its people," which is hammered home five or six times in the climactic talkfest. the bq's constant nasal ranting about "offeeeecious" provides relief from some seriously wanting space effects, is this a tv show?

there's not really that much wrong with crash of the moons. basically it's a few episodes of rocky jones, space ranger merged into a film. it is extremely dated, however. winky's treatment of vena is a good example of this. one has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950's. in this respect, it succeeds. if you like children's sci-fi from the 1950's, go ahead and take a look at it. you'll see john banner in a pre-sgt. schultz role. he does a pretty good job in it. all in all, i'd give it a 6 out of 10. not great, but not bad.

i can't say i was surprised at this atrocity when i watched it a couple months or weeks ago (can't remember). i saw it as a two part episode of zoey 101, because that's how they showed it here in canada.i was incredibly annoyed at the makeover a nerd thing, it's just an example of how unaccepting, unappreciating, superficial, negative, biased, and stereotypical the people in the entertainment business is and frankly i'm extremely peeved. it wasn't at all funny. a nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offended.secondly, the people in zoey 101 don't have real problems. logan has a big house, he has a famous dad, he has everything and zoey is rich too. they never have to deal with the things that today's tweens and teens have to do deal with such as peer pressure, and stereotype problems. also, the actors are horrific. jamie lynn spears doesn't deserve to be in a television show as successful as zoey 101 (what is wrong with the world?), she doesn't have any talent as an actor. in fact, she's worse than britney! the chase and zoey thing was incredibly predictable, i mean how could the show go on with zoey and chase dating? what other problems could they possibly have? except for the fact that chase doesn't get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! the absolute worse 48 minutes of my television watching life. ever. 0/10 (and that's being generous)

oh my god, this is so idiotic. completely pointless, offensive, and repulsive. why do the writers have such a problem with actually getting zoey and chase together we all want them too! in normal shows, there's actually more than one plot conflict in the show, wow, what a concept. also, you cant even tell the zoey 101 episodes apart from each other because the same thing happens every time. quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing, nicole is giggly and stupid, zoey is just kinda there, chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice, and logan is a jerk. repeat. quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing, nicole is giggly and stupid, zoey is just kinda there, chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice, and logan is a jerk. repeat. it's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the movie, omg again. so pointless nothing happens. it's like they specifically designed it so that the movie could fit between any two episodes of the show and the show would go completely unchanged after the movie plot.

ughh this movie is awful. the script is stupid and of course chase doesn't tell zoey he doesn't love her!!! like every episode...ill never understand zoey 101 (the show) also , why the heck does logan's dad act so retarted. and its only about zoey and chase what about the other characters. its always the same in every episode quinn makes and invention something goes terribly wrong with the invention and zoeys brother always gets involved in it. if you haven't seen it don't waste an hour watching this cuz you'll be wasting your time!!smaybe this may be interesting to an eight year old well 8- 10 but i cnat imagine any1 older watching this retarted film. but what can you expect from nick???

oh god. why is it that nickelodeon has such a hard time producing even a half-decent movie? i mean, this movie might have been good, but it was:a. too short b. rather superficial, stereotypical, and insulting to some c. ultimately pointlessfirst of all, the "dress up the nerd to look cool" thing was very consumerist, very superficial, very pointless, and very insulting. it has the stereotypical nerds-stupid faces, glasses, never kissed, vacations with his mom, etc. well maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because he's gay! does that mean that all gays are nerds? and what's wrong with being friends with your mother?the worst part, by far, was the ending. the whole drama of the movie revolved around zoey finding out chase loved her, and blah blah blah, and then, when chase finally decided to tell her, a. he didn't tell her in person because right as he was about to the typical distraction came along b. he tried to text message her, but her pda fell into a fountain and died before she got the message.the end.how lame is that????? i mean, why is it that cartoonists just can't change anything in the series? so many of us would like to see these two get together. why can't we see it? i mean, are the producers really that uncreative, that they can't think up new problems to go with changes in the series? so they have to stick with the same plot and outlines, and make as many episodes as they can just using those? after a while, it gets dull and frustrating.i wanted to see some actual romance in here, darn it!okay. i'm done with my rant.

this is one of crichton's best books. the characters of karen ross, peter elliot, munro, and amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting, complex, and fast-paced throughout this impressive novel.and about 99.8 percent of that got lost in the film. seriously, the screenplay and the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel. i can't fault the actors because frankly, they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to crichton's original work. i know good novels, especially those with a science fiction edge, are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original. but this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever. the book is really, really good. the movie is just dreadful.

i just watched congo on dvd.in most cases i love these kind of movies but this one is different. it made me write my first comment for a movie on imdb. i was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie as a result. you can see there was a lot of money for this production but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script. and as a producer frank marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch; he never should have tried to become another spielberg. this one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you've got all the ingredients but if you can't cook stay out of the kitchen. if can make a suggestion don't spend your money on this one. if you want to see it watch it on television first and make up your own mind.

congo is probably the worst big-budget movie of the 1990s. it is so bad that it is watchable over and over again. a bunch of folks with different agendas probe deep into darkest africa, where they encounter a temple of riches just like in king solomon's mines -- but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding those riches. on their side, the humans have a "talking" gorilla named amy who helps save the day at one point or another. so much for the plot. the dialogue throughout is witless, the acting almost uniformly atrocious, certainly campy (tim curry and ernie hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor), and the special effects abysmal. wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas. and the lava! oh yes, did i mention there's a volcanic eruption to top off the big finale? laura linney of all people is along for this bumpiest of rides. what could she have been thinking? this is right around the same time she appeared with richard gere and ed norton in primal fear, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.

this was a highly-hyped movie prior to its release, but turned out to be a dud. i never talked to one person who ever liked this movie. i agree: i didn't like it, either. perhaps one big reason it wasn't a box office success was that it had nothing but unappealing characters in the story.for awhile there - i don't know if this is still true - i hadn't any movie in which laura linney or dylan walsh played anything but annoying characters.that, and a stupid story, make this film a big disappointment, especially considering that big buildup. did the filmmakers, with dialog this dumb, really think this was going to be a hit?

if you can make it through this flick without laughing out loud at the screen, you are a better filmgoer than i.count the logic lapses, common-sense leaps, and credibility stretches... betcha need more than two hands!p.s.: if one more film uses a location that is clearly ucla, and claims that it is a different university (in this movie's case: berkeley), i'm going to lose it.

i love bad movies: showgirls, plan 9 from outerspace, so on. and this movie fits right in. don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film. it's downright awful. tim curry's accent moves from german to portuguese to hungarian. there's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the ape's sign language. there is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark. there are people hopping up and down mt. kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it. this thing is laughably ridiculous. so ridiculous i was rolling on the floor. it is totally implausible. i loved every minute of it.

anyone who has seen the piece of steaming smelly poo called congo understands my title. and i feel for you. this movie wasn't just bad. it was painful. the book was stupid, the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible. dylan walsh? rumor has it julia roberts dumped your ass cause this movie blew so bad. huge diamonds? killer gorillas? talking gorillas? hmmm. sounds like a hit! oh! tim curry's accent is so bad in this movie i would prefer being deaf! i recommend this movie to bulimics looking to purge after a heavy meal or kavorkian patients who just need that one more reason to die. if this is faithful to the book, i would say lets have us a good old fashion footloose book burning and destroy every copy. if future generations look back and find this garbage, how would we explain ourselves? listen to the others who hated this movie! don't watch it! run away! do not watch this movie! if you think it is full of action or suspense or cool effects, you are wrong! if you think it blows more cock than nicole ritchie, you'd be right. so if you still are going to watch crapo..,.i mean congo, i say do it after you just took 50 tylenol pm.

the book, while not particularly great, was decent, but this movie completely changes it. a lot of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie, but dr. ross' character goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with her greed to a heart-on-her-sleeve damsel in distress who won't do anything if she even catches the slightest hint that it might be less than noble. when movies change the book that much but keep the same name, it should be a crime.

let's see: there's a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, some regular gorillas, a previously unknown species of killer albino gorilla, the most powerful laser ever known to man, a *lot* of diamonds lying mined and loose in the sand, attack hippos, an active volcano, and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a downed plane. that's not too much, is it? i've had more coherent fever dreams ("... and then the romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds, because this was a lost city that he had been looking for or something, but then the mean gorillas that we had seen before came out of nowhere and ate him. now somehow the talking gorilla was back from visiting the regular gorillas, and, as a kind of earthquake or volcano started, the woman industrialist/doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead fiance's hand..."). it's a blast if you're looking for more ammunition against the pernicious influence of michael crichton in american entertainment (and hence world entertainment), and if you keep firmly in mind the extent to which this cynical and half-hearted attempt fell on its face at the boxoffice. but, sadly, the men responsible -- crichton, sceenwriter john patrick shanley, director frank marshall -- probably never lost a dime. shame on them, and i mean that. 1/10

"congo" is based on the best-selling novel by michael crichton, which i thought lacked crichton's usual charm, smart characters and punch. well, sorry to say, but the same goes for the film.here's the plot:greed is bad, this simple morality tale cautions. a megalomaniacal c.e.o. (joe don baker) sends his son into the dangerous african congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitter (or is it laser weapons?). when contact is lost with his son and the team, his daughter-in-law (laura linney), a former cia operative and computer-freak, is sent after them. on her quest, she is accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary (ernie hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (dylan walsh), and a a nutty indiana-jones-type looking for king solomon's mines (tim curry). after some narrow escapes from surface-to-air missiles and some african wildlife, they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. the actors in this movie were not talented. dylan walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end; ernie hudson is unconvincing (is it no wonder he went on to star in tv films?) and laura linney is nothing special. i think i can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles: joe don baker and tim curry, an always enjoyable actor (although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his "rocky horror picture" days). this movie also had some other problems, including awful direction style, cheesy dialogue and a just-plain-boring plot, which was completely hashed when compared to crichton's novel. not even stan winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster. i am deeply disappointed in this movie; there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with. it was just plain awful, cheesy, boring and ridiculous, and proves to be one of the worst crichton book-to-film productions.2/5 stars -john ulmer

i'd give this film a zero if i could. how anyone could rate it any higher is beyond me. until i saw rollerball, this was my pick for worst film ever from a major studio with a real budget (claiming mangler 2 or leprechaun in the hood as the worst ever isn't really saying much, those are supposed to be bad)tim curry's mom must have needed surgery or something for him to agree to this non-sensical garbage. i'm really not sure what happened here. the novel was great, the director frank marshall had a solid track record with alive and arachnophobia (perhaps they should have changed the title to 'africa'), the cast was good and the budget was there. you'd think someone would have bothered to read the script.you'd be better off watching battlefield: earth again than wasting your time with. congo makes you long for the return of mst3k

publicity got me to the theatreadvice will take you away from this waist of time.very bad everything.do you really want to see a monkey talking with a technological device?x

after a string of successful 'a man and his monkey films', which included the seminal "every which way but loose", "every which way you can" and "peter's friends", the genre fell on hard times. in an effort to rejuvenate this once celebrated area, director frank marshall brought michael crichton's acclaimed novel to the big screen.think 'gorillas in the mist' meets 'tron' minus the box-office clout of bruce boxleitner. this is one mans doomed love affair for his talking monkey. not helped by bad accents (tim curry struggles with a romanian), a baboon of a screenplay, hungry hippos, skydiving primates and bruce campbell. ape-sh*t.

i debated quite a bit over what rating to give this one because it's my least favorite herschell gordon lewis film so far other than the gruesome twosome, but it has the best acting i've seen in a lewis film. however, we all know that's not saying much. once the movie was done, i was happy because it felt like i had been sitting through a 4 hour movie, though it was only 82 minutes long. i'm trying to see all of hgl's films and that's probably the only reason to see this one.the gore is good as usual, the one thing that herschell seemed to get right. the acting is just as bad as usual with one exception. that exception is frank kress. now, would i say that he's a good actor? no way, but he's good compared to everyone else. the story is boring and flat and goes no where and by the end, i didn't care what happened just so long as it ended. i know this is a cult classic but i didn't enjoy it very much at all. i hope you will.

i love camp movies, believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of gordon lewis don't bother me at all, but this is just one of his most stupid movies, even more than blood feast, i'm not kidding. the gore gore girls is about a mad person who kills a lot of go(re) - go(re) girls of a night club. a detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret. maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting h.g lewis films, but that is not saying much. the camera work is even dreadful.but at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting ... you going to pass a good time with it, and the killings are just absurd in a very, very bad way: a girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt (!) and just don't let me talk about what it does with the nipples. you going to laugh like anyone with this. but the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it's campness: the go-go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very american way. though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an x rating because of it's violence.only if you want lo laugh and pass a good time (but only with a lot, a lot of beers).

aside from frank kress (who played abraham gentry), an appearance by henny youngman and the last seconds of the movie, there really wasn't anything particularly good about this film. why it is currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me--the film is 99.44% crap...and exactly what i would have expected from director hershell gordon lewis. in the 1960s and 70s, lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films, such as blood feast and monster a go-go. however, in recent years he's been christened "the father of gore" and he has many, many fans--fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were. but apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts, at heart, his films are pure crap--and don't believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films. this would be like putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvre!!the film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to strippers. when i say gruesome, it's very bloody and sick for 1972--though by today's standards the special effects look amazingly lame. so, while some very deviant and cruel murders happen in the film (i'd rather not explain them--they are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women), at least they won't nauseate you because they were done so poorly. it's obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and mannequins. but to have them doing some of the sick acts, even if unrealistic, is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogyny.the only hope in the film, as the police are all idiots, is a guy named abraham gentry--whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor, david lochary, from the early john waters films. while his acting is bad, he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest. he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made!! it was also odd that so many women wanted him--especially because they just didn't seem like his type.as for the rest of the folks in the film, they are cretins and idiots who could not act. in fact, i was kind of hoping more would be killed--they really had it coming! none of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director never re-shot a single scene--as most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in ed wood's masterpiece, plan 9 from outer space. in fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearing in the film is that they be willing to take off their clothes. now i know this will sound pretty mean, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who strip to get their next fix. when these ladies take off their clothes, men in the crowd give them money to put it back on (wow--henny youngman should have said that in the film)! but, considering lewis' budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get.overall, a sleazy bucket of bile that manages to be worse than most of the director's other films...and that's saying a lot! it's violent (yet dumb), anti-women (treating them like meat and things to be mutilated) and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish.

it doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a uk distributor, and then had to release it as a free dvd with a sunday newspaper. the distributors could clearly see what the film-makers and the sunday newspaper couldn't, that this was one movie that just wasn't going to recoup its costs.since it's a thriller about riddles, it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly, rather than the mumbling vinnie jones who appears to pronounce "riddle" as "riell". and it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. the plot is ludicrous: the lost charles dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders, but so would a copy of herge's adventures of tintin, since the link between dickens and jones is more non-existent than tenuous. and we have the ridiculous premise that a would-be investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered dickens manuscript, would take several days to read it, just so that flashbacks to dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie, as if they had some connection to it. which they don't. i mean, if you found a new dickens manuscript, wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it ? the film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since the sixth sense, but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence. if the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour, then revealing that vinnie jones is a robot might have been more acceptable. it might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish, but it isn't. and in several places it appears decidedly amateur: there's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique, but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts. consequently, you can see things changing at the edge of frame, when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame. a good rule in movie-making is: if you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else.the real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place.

i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film, 9.5? unfortunately it looks like i am not alone.the film, is slow and boring really, one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high.unfortunately, this was not the case, so when watching the film, and seeing the poor story and acting, i am left giving it a 3/10 score.vinnie jones is superb in lock stock, and also snatch, and he plays a great hard man, however, he should stick to this role. its a bit like when stallone and schwarzenegger have done comedy films, they just don't work.neither can he play lead actor, he plays better as supporting or otherwise. when he plays lead, his acting talents are too 'in view' and shown up as not really very good. mean machine is another good example of this.

the riddle as a concept is an interesting idea, but i'm afraid is miscast, vinnie if given the hard man role is his element as in lock stock and snatch. in this movie vinnie plays a newspaper sports writer (greyhounds to be precise),who during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who 10-15 years his senior. i'm sorry vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish. trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the thames. he takes on the role of policeman, whilst the real police are bit part players, interceeding with flashbacks from charles dickens.when vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but does'nt in this part need act tough, snarling at the camera in parts. if you watch the mean machine, he is perfectly cast, and believable and does a very decent performance. getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to charles dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day, these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used. the sound on the movie especially from julie cox is inaudible at times, and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of vinnies love interest, she starts the film as a detecive, but quickly becomes the girlfriend.the death of the prostitute is sort of answered but yet/not answered . strip out the charles dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie.vinnie, is slowly becoming britans steven segal, stick to the supporting actor role, your'e quite good at it.

ouch. this is one ugly movie. not only is it badly acted, but it absolutely destroyed the book as well. horrible. how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me, but they sure did. don't even think about even renting this.

this movie is one of the poorest adaptations of a fabulous book that i've seen. jean george's novel is a fantastic book that i think is an outstanding read for any child. i can't give the same endorsement to this movie.

i hardly know where to begin.huge continuity issues, bad acting, etc. for example, sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head.but the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, sam's adventurousness paving the way to improve the lot of his entire family, is not even touched upon. instead, in the movie, he gets ticked off at his family and leaves his wealthy parents to be by himself and, when he gets tired of it, he goes home. where is his development? where is the arc?if you have never read the book and can get through the hokey 60isms (double/triple/quadruple visions of the falcon) and terrible production quality (crackling, ahem, fire, winter winds stopping their howling for the dialog and then restarting, etc.) i guess it *might* be ok for an 8 year old. but compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment. read the book instead.

the movie isn't too bad, up until...the main problem is with the ending, so it's a pretty major spoiler...for the time it was made, it's a beautiful movie, and does get a lot of it right.however...in the book, sam succeeds and lives his dream, whereas in the movie, he gives up and goes back to the city, completely destroying the "you can do what you put your mind to" theme of the book.this movie is a desecration, and instead of remaking classics that don't need redone, the hollywood types who haven't any better ideas should do this one, right this time.

role-reversal remake of 1942's "the major and the minor" has jerry lewis stepping into the part originally played by ginger rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just ginger. lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he's successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. sidney sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for dean martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). diana lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays lewis' love-interest here. she's cute; jerry isn't. *1/2 from ****

with al jolson at the height of his popularity and warner brothers's the jazz singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own jolson-esquire characters. but while the jazz singer was a sensation for its being the first part-talkie, the matinée idol lacks the singing voice of its star (the now obscure johnnie walker), and has to make do with just his visual antics.the matinée idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned frank capra. capra's first couple of full-length features for harry langdon reveal a very showy, excessive style, which made langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable. a couple of pictures later and capra has learnt to ease off a bit, with some fairly regular and decent camera-work. however he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy. the longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have a few good gags, but it's all cut up into lots of different camera angles, and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances. theoretically, a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles, but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny.of course, capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director, and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect. he cuts down the line, closing in on walker and bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his don wilson get up, neatly establishing the wordless connection between them. then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade, which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in capra's early 30s output.johnnie walker, columbia's answer to al jolson, is not an exceptional talent. his comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out. bessie love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too, with a very expressive face. kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. there's also a good role for lionel belmore, that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s.the matinée idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces. in and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece, and like most of capra's work before he met robert riskin, a disappointment.

royal rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn good. the rumble itself is pretty uneventful, filled with mid carders, and a winner that really had no point in winning, and why on earth did the young stallions vs the islanders main event? half the crowd left. jessie ventura sounds bored, through half the thing, and you can tell when he mentions he finds the development of hogan vs andre more interesting. mcmahon and ventura don't have the chemistry of gorilla and jessie.ricky steamboat vs ravishing rick rude. heavily disappointing match, with too many rest holds, and too much of a sluggish pace, sink this one. when it picks up like crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. steamboat wins by dq.2 1/2 /5next is up dino bravo attempting to set a new bench press record, with ventura spotting him. horrendous segment, with no entertainment value what so ever. ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, and even mcmahon admitted it was boring. controversy or not, i wasted enough time on this crap.0/5wwf woman's tag team championship.2 out of 3 falls.the glamour girls|c|/w jimmy hart. vs the jumping bomb angels. this is the best match of the night, no i'm not kidding!. very exciting stuff for woman's wrestling, and you'll be hard pressed to find stuff this good, now a days. the jumping bomb angels were way over, and the crowd went ape sh*t for their title win.3/5contract signing between hulk hogan and andre the giant. hogan gets a decent pop, but there a few noticeable boo's for him, probably because its in canada. a bit too drawn out for my liking, but it was necessary for the storyline. it got it's point across, and had some effective moments, but a lot of the times, i kept saying "get on with it". both sign, and andre slams hogan's head on the table, and pushes the table on him.2 1/2 /5royal rumble match. very weak royal rumble, probably due to awkward pacing, and the true lack of star power. i think vince was testing the waters with this one, and it showed. ventura seems uninterested, and i don't blame him. crowd clearly wanted roberts to win, yelling ddt almost every 5 minutes he was in there, and while duggan got a good pop, i don't believe he was the winner they wanted, and where did this take his career? nowhere. bret's 1st ever royal rumble, and he made an impressive showing. it wasn't terrible, but it was quite lackluster, and it didn't have enough to make the show, considering this was what the show was based on.2 1/2 /5hogan has an interview with craig degeorge. standard hulkster interview, but not with the same craziness, and outrageous remarks he usually pulls.2/5ted and andre get interviewed. andre claims he will deliver the championship to mr. dibiase. short, but effective.3/52 out of 3 falls.the islanders vs the young stallions. crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them bolted for the exit's. it's quite dull, and had no business being in the main event. jessie and vince seem bored, and argue about other things while the match is taking place. islanders win, due to taking advantage of roma's injury.2/5bottom line. historically important i suppose, but there is really nothing to see here. this was just a starting cue for great things to come for the royal rumble, and while you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing on here, going out of your way to see. i usually recommend everything once for die hard wrestling fans, and considering it's the 1st royal rumble event, i suppose i have too, but prepare to be bored a lot of the time.3/10

i bought this 'film' from a gas station in the 3.99 bin for one reason: billy drago, who is one of my favorite actors. he is terrifically creepy and good, but that's where it stops. the movie itself is a dirt cheap, gratingly awful attempt at a horror western, and manages neither, never mind a successful merging of the two genres. the acting besides drago's is so bad i wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears, the production values are nonexistent and the script , i don't even know where to start.avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard drago fan like me.terrible, shameful unforgivable.

an interesting premise, and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: i'd love to see drago, stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!). the soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable. still, it was the sets that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. i don't know where this was filmed, but were i to hazard a guess, it would be either an open-air museum, or one of those re-enactment villages, where everything is just a bit too well-kept to do more than suggest the "real old west". okay, so it was shot on a college kid's budget. that said, i could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults. but taken all together, and being generous, i could not see giving it more than three stars.

alleged "scream queen" debbie rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex-confederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacre.action and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character development.billy drago is good in the thankless (not to mention pointless) role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor, including the town and the fort, both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at party city.do yourself a big favor and watch ravenous instead.

this movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest repute) who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop. upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there (even though its only 15 miles away), so they walk. when they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby. they soon find that something isn't right here and fort mcmillan (ft. doom as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. rather than go into the plot line i will make some comments about things i noticed about the movie. first off the acting is very flat, only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in. my first though was poor acting, but at the end i watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive. so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it. on top of the bad acting i have a great problem where the people don't react right to a given set of circumstances. take for example no one would take them to ft mcmillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away. yet when we arrive at the fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people, all of whom must get supplies from some one, not to mention mail etc. it is supposed to take place in 1867, yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights (they aren't on at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general style of locomotives so popular at that time. there are also places where you can see paved blacktop, (and maybe a car at one point, didn't want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. if they had followed the rules of the "world" they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 i gave it, and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better.

the real plot...a group of post-civil war prostitutes seek alternative housing in fort boom. lacy everett and a close-knit family of call girls have been eating date expired sausages for days and plan to move into the former fort mcmillian. locals warn the women of eating more of the dated sausage. because there is a vicious pyromaniac loose in the area and he refuse to shuttle them out to the property. when they finally arrive at their destination, they discover their stomach is full of gass after all the bad sausage. it is not long before they learn why their new home is called fort boom.

charlie (george "norm" wendt) and rhonda ("just say" julie brown) are a pair of cheerful, murderous aliens who become stranded on earth and stumble upon a tiny western town. they become deputy sheriffs and dish out a deadly form of justice to speeders, murderers and others, while getting on the bad side of some of locals (led by wayne grace). meanwhile, their sexy alien daughter (anastasia sakelaris) arrives in a skimpy/shiny outfit with her black human husband (christopher m. brown) to find them and tv reporters and government agents turn up to fill up time.from what i can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, sci-fi, horror, western...) in one movie, and what a stupid, unfunny mess it is, despite energetic acting from the two stars. the script is downright atrocious.

one of the worst films of it's genre.the only bright spots were lee merriwether showing some of the sparkle she would later bring to the time tunnel and batman.a young patty duke also outshone the more established actors.

robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional! atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way. perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive; it's a camp-fest tailor-made for tv's late-late show. wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional, though patty duke (playing a cute brat pre-"miracle worker") gets a colorful, memorable exit. ** from ****

this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!. all the characters are decent i guess, but the story is so so, however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored. jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together, and it was very boring a lot of times, however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining, and had some good stunts!. i have not yet seen the hong kong version, however i'm sure it's better then this dud, plus the twist is very predictable!. it's really lifeless and bland, and i don't blame jackie for not looking happy in this, and if he didn't star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable. the opening is supposed to be memorable, but it's nothing i haven't seen before and done better at that, and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it!, plus i really didn't root for any of the characters. this is a very mediocre jackie chan film, and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!, not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans. the direction is terrible!. james glickenhaus does a terrible job here, with extremely bland camera work, bad angles, and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout. the acting is so so. jackie chan is amazing as always, however he is not his usual energetic self, and looks bored and ps*ed off throughout the film, had zero chemistry with danny aiello, and i really don't blame him either! (jackie rules!!!!!). danny aiello is ok here, as jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass, and he had zero chemistry with jackie, he did ok i guess. roy chiao is decent as the main villain, but was just going through the motions and wasn't all that menacing, he still is damn cool though. rest of the cast are average at best. overall not worth your time or money. *1/2 out of 5

the protector. you hear the name. you think, "ah, it's a crappy hong kong movie." guess what - it's not hong kong. and yes, it is crappy. this amazingly stupid jackie chan film, ruined by us, yes us, the americans (i'm boiling with anger, ooh, i think i'll jump out that window!), has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang, avenging the death of his buddy. sounds cool...but it's not. don't waste your money renting it. to prove he could make a better cop film, chan made the amazing police story (1985).

this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses. his low-budget hong kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris. there is nothing about chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star. in his hong kong films chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but "the protector" is lifeless throughout. danny aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. both have been better in worse movies. the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings. the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab. it wouldn't be until the made-in-canada "rumble in the bronx" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie.

most critics have written devastating about that michalkov-movie, but i wanted it to see myself. and, unfortunately, they are right. the film had the greatest budget ever in russian movie history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot quite close to the kremlin - but in the end it appears to be a nice, sweet nothing. you would not believe, that this director earlier has made masterpieces like urga and burnt by the sun. the characters in the storyline are not convincing, neither jane nor mccracken nor andrej. only general radlov worth being mentioned. it remains on the surface all the time. politically it is to me a glorification of the army, and especially the russian one with values like honor and duty. and, having lived at least half a year in siberia: my russia is much more than the one that is depicted in michalkovs movie. regarding "burnt by the sun" by the same director as a no-question-10-points-movie, one of the best i ever seen in my entire life, i was totally disappointed by that one. sorry. nevertheless, michalkovs unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there.

i saw this ego-centric "effort" at achieving a film of "epic" status in the company of several native russian family members. five people gave 5 different reactions, from mikhalkov worship to my cynicism.i saw a movie that looked like mikhalkov took a lot of "canal +" money, put some of it in his (and other's) pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of film students. i counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. there is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes. contrast these for yourself:·cadets polishing shoes with a dog.·train station scene (saying goodbye to andrei).·outdoor panorama shots.·ormond talking through the keyhole.·initial attempt on the grand duke and later chase scenes to get andrei back to sing in figaro.·fencing sequencejulia ormond is faster than superman. learning about his transfer belatedly, she gets all the way across moscow in one minute to say goodbye to andrei.the russian natives felt that the impression given of russian life was "caricature" and not history. they called it "tourist postcard" russia.they were all proud that a russian director/producer/fixer has managed to break into the "big time" and be able to waste over 30 million dollars of other people's money while maybe putting a little into local pockets during filming.if you want to "think" you have seen russia go see this movie. drink some coffee before you go.

this movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in russia. "epic movie about russian culture", "great saga of russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. for me this movie was the biggest disappointment. the main character played by oleg menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. what is there to admire? in the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all. people's festival scenes look like boasting about russian audacity.i respect mr. mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director, but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the "tzar" of russian cinema.

set in a post apocalyptic future, the new highlander is an effeminate little twerp named quentin macleod, who is being mentored by a new ramirez while his little sister tags along on their quest to thwart an evil immortal overlord. to do so, quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this overlord, korton, does.in short, this is pure crap, much like the highlander sequels. quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and bitching in a "woe is me for i am a reluctant hero" kind of way, and he never catches on to the fact that he's an immortal and can't be killed, at least not easily. ramirez would have done better to ditch him and thwart korton himself.

if you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival, do not be misled by what it says in the booklet. this is a complete waste of time and energy. i have watched bunuel, i have seen dali, and admired them; but this isn't surrealism, this is not supposed to be at all. didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture? after we become extinct by global warming, these will be the remainings of our civilization. what if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital? with all due respect to the effort put in this, maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film - or whatever it is.

avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but i personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. it gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. what remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. i believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but i surely didn't noticed! the nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable. i have to say i fought hard to continue seeing it until the end, and i am still not sure it was worth it...

let me say at the outset that i'm not a very artistic person and that i don't "get" new art. that being said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion not crazy in a good way. filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories, avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say "wow, i feel the energy and passion of this painting." the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts, though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film. two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, as to do what these characters were doing, i have no idea. i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.

the abc gears up it's repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia. yes folks, it's all there baca bourke (jeremy sims,an actor of little talent) fire hero , lill (libby tanner plays bronwyn craig in the bush), fifi (nadia townsend) town slut, preggers by baca's brother joe (i think). then there's uncle geoff the, big daddy of lost springs. uncle geoff's scenes are like tennessee williams on speed. only saving grace is russian actress natalia novikova as baca's loony missus. she is great. i can't understand why john waters took the gig as lilly's psychologist husband. must have needed the money i expect! still, he won't last long as lill and baca will be having it off toute suit. just watch this lemon to see how bad an aussie show can be. frankly, i'm ashamed.

i decided to hire out this movie along with a few other old horror movies.this was the worst,some of the killings were good and theres a bit of humour but i couldnt stand this,everytime a killing happened they would show scenes of all these old movies that the killer used to be in,i give this 2/10.

okay, so this was made way back in 1993. directed loosely by robert iscove and written loosely by john miglis, it's supposed to be based on a true story. hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. for certainly it was obvious from the beginning that this dame was after all she could get.tim matheson, looking somewhat older than i remember him, played the empty headed man who was looking for romance in his somewhat dull and empty life. well, it came to him in the likes of tracy pollan, a somewhat vacant looking girl with kinky sex as her means of conquering her guys.come on, phone sex, even in the 90s was old hat. can't believe someone would fall for that old line. but mr. matheson seemed to buy it. and it cost him plenty. the hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the dame out of his apartment, putting all her junk in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then had the stupidity not to change the locks. that's when i had enough of this trite movie. it made me want to wish the dame had tried it on me so i could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a hike.i give this chestnut a 1 out of 100. that's how bad i thought it was. i guess you can't blame the actors. but they were awful. did they actually try to play this with a straight face?

although a well produced made for television movie, dying to love you reeks with low grade melodramatic splendor.the film opens up to roger paulson (tim matheson, looking much older than i remember him to be), who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty, lonely life after his wife ruthie (who looks suspiciously like roseanne arnold) leaves him with the quickness. now all roger has is his cats....and his ad in the newspaper. once his ad is answered, he calls johnnie-elaine-lisa-oh it doesn't matter i'm whoever you want me to be-lawrence. then...they have phone sex.i'm not sure where you're from or when you were born, but i remember that phone-sex bit was played out by the late '80's. i'm sorry but that was trashy.soon roger and the broad hook up and have a whirlwind romance. they fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then have some kinky sex with roger's son in the other room. she ties him to the bed and seduces him.roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that johnnie-eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around. god forbid women only sleep with one man. soon enough, strange phone calls begin to occur, johnny girl wants roger to marry her with absolute quickness, and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her. it's funny to see roger believe her through all this stuff. that's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife. he takes her crappy advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase crawling with fake id cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow. he immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested. even though all this jazz, he still loves the dumb broad. she tells so much lies, it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once.roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named angela who looks like something off of gremlins 2. she has a child as well and roger takes quite a liking to her. but something inside roger's subconscious keeps him connected to lisa rohn (if that's even her real name) and he keeps going back to see her.now lisa is the "ex that won't go away" as she "earns" herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at roger's doorstep and his son matt is so busy trying to check her out, he pours juice all over the floor. il' rog is so stupid, he throws lisa out and doesn't even change the locks. boy, if all people were that stupid, i wouldn't even be writing this review. the ending of this movie is so corny, you won't believe.tim matheson is a made-for-tv-movie king. he just looks like such a dawm mummy in this movie. he's a little wooden and stiff. the dazzling tracy pollan works well with her role and her trampiness rings true. she is extremely beautiful and i do see what michael j. fox sees in her. this movie is great to watch when you're on that late night tip, but then again, you might fall asleep, considering how dull and bland it is.

this (allegedly) based-on-a-true story tv movie concerns a woman on the run from the fbi and a *seriously* stupid guy.first, we have roger paulson (tim matheson), a "regular guy" type with a mind-numbing job, an ex-wife, a kid he hardly ever gets to see and some cats.next, there is "elaine-lisa-you name it" (tracy pollan), a smart, sexy, good looking woman whose tongue would burst into flame if she ever told the truth.roger and lisa meet when she answers a lonely-hearts ad. roger is one of these poor saps who can't seem to handle living alone, so after his wife dumped him, he places his ad.it doesn't take long for roger to figure out that lisa is *not* a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her. he doesn't even have enough sense to change the locks on his apartment door after he throws her out.go ahead and watch this if you don't have anything else to do.

the grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me wish there were more synonyms for "terrible" in the english language. with a plot replete with more holes than a trawlers net, this film fails to make compulsive viewing for a fan of even the most inane films, which i am. i felt compelled to remain in the cinema until i had extracted £5.70p worth of entertainment from it, though i feared that i would be there for some years. a better film could be made from the out takes of the first installment of the grudge, though i am not altogether sure this isn't the result of such an exercise. as expected, what passes for a plot in this dire example of wasted celluloid, finishes with no resolution whatsoever, thereby leaving the producers with the option of inflicting 'the grudge 3' upon the public when the time comes that they feel yet another pang of true hatred for civilisation.

the original grudge (the original american remake) surprisingly pulled off just about everything you could do right with a ghost flick. it had suspense, dark and moody atmosphere, some good jolts, and some genuinely creepy images. the grudge 2 attempts all of these techniques, but ultimately fails, only showing us the same old stuff we saw in the first movie, as well as a messy storyline constantly switching from tokyo to california. it begins in tokyo with some schoolgirls who wander into the house, now heavily blocked by one strip of police tape. one of them comes face to face with a similar wide-eyed ghost girl while trapped in a closet. she gets out, screaming frantically and they all run out of there. next we cut to america where karen's sister is sent by their mother to japan to find and bring her back home. we eventually find ourselves following a very familiar concept involving a curious guy and girl investigating the history of a mysterious house. we cut back and forth to the girls from the beginning who are disappearing one by one as well as a young boy hearing strange noises in the next apartment at night, all leading up to a very unsatisfying ending. the "scare" scenes are dull and ineffective. like the ring 2, avoid this god awful sequel...

i am a huge fan of the first four ju-on projects. i own them, and watch them every few months. i lend them to co-workers and friends just so they can get a good scare from quality japanese film making. i think takashi shimizu created a great story, and presented it very effectively in these four installments.i was somewhat excited about the grudge 2 opening in theaters. i saw the first american grudge before watching the four originals. the grudge was actually pretty good. of course, the originals are better, but i got a good halloween scare from the 2004 american grudge.the grudge 2 started off badly, and went down from there. i kept waiting for it to get better, to make sense, to show shimizu's talent - nothing like this happened. the thing that's great about shimizu's ju-on work is the story. true, it's usually told in a disjointed style that you have to think about to connect its components, but it is still a great story. there was no story in the grudge 2. it was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you never had time to even start to care about.the editing was atrocious. disjointed (as in the japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete randomness of scene sequence was exhausting. i just kept thinking, "this is so stupid," and, "no - he didn't really sell out this much did he??" it made me want to walk out of the theater, run home, and watch the original work, simply to reassure myself that shimizu has not always made this dumbed-down, generic, boring, non-sensical, thrown-together tripe.if you really have your heart set on seeing this movie, i suggest you wait the 2 months to rent it. really. two of the five people in the theater with me walked out about 45 minutes into it. i debated on whether to do that myself. going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that point.i am truly shocked at how bad this movie was. let's pray sam raimi doesn't put out more cash to make the grudge 3. it's just not worth it anymore. sigh.

i went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations. i went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain the story of the grudge 1 to me. well, if the first one couldn't leave an impression on them to explain the plot, then i doubted this one would be any better.let me summarize what the trailers let you know: the asian lady is back and so is sarah michelle gellar. luckily for her, she isn't around very long. that decision may have saved her career.the movie has three story lines, and none of them make sense. and even worse, none of them are developed. you almost start to understand, and then someone dies and the story gets left behind. okay, killing people could be scary, but i was left more confused over the attempted plot development than i was frightened. they jump back and forth between all three story lines, which aren't related... or are they?!?! *sound effecttt*~~~ the timing of the three stories are displaced, and you can tell right at the start that the movie is going to have a twist at the end. be prepareddd. oh wait. sorry, this isn't a fight club or vertigo quality twist, you could see this one coming from miles away. and probably envisioned a much better twist in your head... they should've hired me. instead of the girl making her "surprising" appearance, maybe it could've been michael jackson instead? that part of scary movie 4 scared the crap out of me.the killing sequences were terribly done. unlike horror movies of the past, where a killer pops out of nowhere, a closet or behind a door for example, and everyone in the theatre jumps (and subsequently the fat guy behind you spills popcorn down your neck)- this lacked any frightening pop ups. they zoomed in on where the random asian woman or kid would show up, and you knew exactly what was coming. instead of having the music get really loud, then quiet, then a pop out to psyche you out, the music actually gave you timing for the scary scene. if i know it's coming, it won't scare me.the movie began with explaining what the "grudge" is; when a person is killed during a fit of rage, a curse is placed on the location where she was killed. so why does the asian lady being cursed by her mother have any significance to the story? and why is the grudge now moving countries? this movie was absolutely terrible.all it did was leave me begrudging my friends for making me go- we should've seen one of those animated pixar movies. it would've been scarier.

this film was utter tripe. possible that it is in fact a pollution. the subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake are no where to be seen. sarah michelle gellar is given nothing to do, even in her death sequence, but still she is the best performance in this film, and the her death is the best thing about it, even though she did deserve a better death. its the sign of very bad writing and directing. i'm guessing she did this film to end her connection with it as its turning rubbish.not scary. not tense. not funny. makes no sense at all. and as said above sarah michelle gellar gives the only reasonable performance out of the entire cast.

all the way though i was thinking to myself "oh god why!" at the very beginning i thought "right it might be average," but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious.every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, eg. the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches. my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right.why does going into the house make her come after you, it doesn't make sense. it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all.you can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. oh shes behind her ... didn't see that one coming *yawns*.surely these people must have thought to... oh i don't know, carry a knife round or at least try and fight back, instead of being eaten but someone hair? at best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short "oh thank god." if you haven't already, don't waste your' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!

don't waste your time or money on going to see or even renting it. it is by far the worst move i have ever seen. its two hours (way too long) of your life you're never getting back. if you're looking to be scared, go see something else. we went with someone who still has nightmares about the gremlins and she wasn't scared in the least.there are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt at making money. now before i begin, let me say that i loved the first grudge! however the second one is something of a different story. the plot is very in-depth and intricate. however in the end you are wondering "what the heck was this or that all about." the acting would be considered poor in a b list pornography film. i could site several examples but i don't want to spoil it for those that are glutens for punishment, but i can sum up two horrible hours in two simple words.... it's spreading.

this "remake" is a complete disgrace: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic, it wouldn't deserve more than a couple of spiteful lines.it's also a cheat, with a laughable script served by such contrived and amateurish "acting", you're always aware there's a set, a camera, a fake, no direction, no suspended reality whatsoever to allow you delve into the story.the claustrophobic, stifling tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original japanese masterpieces (ju-on 1 & 2) is all but lost here in overblown sets and spaces.but worst of all, the moral enormity and unbearable suffering, which both imparted a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims turned into relentlessly vindictive ghouls, is completely ruined by utter nonsense and hollow boogie-man style scares.if american audiences aren't willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow this kind of patronizing hogwash instead, they fully deserve this pathetic curse: the movie itself.

that was a waste of 9 dollars. the movie was terrible. all the "scary" parts were pointless and sadly repetitive. seemingly all of the tense parts could be completely predicted, and did not seem to hold any bit of the audiences attention. also, the plot line didn't advance at all during the entire movie, and it was all just a big setup for the grudge 3. when it seemed like the movie was about to make a big plot advancement, it turned out just to be a pointless scene. these directors need to follow hitchcock's example: every scene has a point. porbably 90% of the scenes in this movie could have been left out with no change of the plot. final opinion: don't waste your time, energy or money!!!

let me start off by saying that i loved the original grudge. it was bar none one of the scariest, most hair-rising experiences i've ever had in a filled movie theatre. i'm not kidding. being a self-declared japanophile also made the flick look better in my eyes (if the setting had been changed to some american suburb i probably would've ended up hating the film).that said... this movie is a complete mess! i won't say it sucks, because a) the movie does have some good points, b) "it sucks" is the lamest put-down in the history of lame put-downs. so what does the movie have going for it? well, for starters it has a pretty cool look: through filters and the use of bleak, washed-out colours, takashi shimizu almost recreates the downbeat, angst-ridden atmosphere of the original. a few scenes are genuinely shocking and unpredictable. unfortunately, the rest of the film is just plain bad. period.the story is all over the place, needlessly told tarantino style, i.e. the scenes are out of chronological order. this technique is pointless in the case of this movie and it merely makes things more confusing. frankly, a straightforward plot would've worked better. the original was also lacking plot-wise, but it did make sense and the film more than made up for its thin plot with lots of scares and a genuinely tense atmosphere. grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of time.let's not forget the tv-show acting skills which make the cast of the original grudge look like emily watson and katherine hepburn. simply put, the movie doesn't work. it's too slow, too dull, and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot (which adds nothing new to the story, by the way, so not even grudge fans will be pleased).oh, and what is it with the old man playing japanese peek-a-boo on the bus?? is this supposed to be comic relief? artistic statement? or what?

people may say i am harsh but i can't help it. the movie is so bad i was absolutely stunned. the first movie was bad enough if you ask me. it was greatly exaggerated and silly but this one, despite the creepy scenes, has a seriously ass-stupid story. they actually went deep into investigating kayako's past and found out that she had a mother (who miraculously speaks english) who was an exorcist and "fed" evil spirits to her daughter. stupid? yeap. ok, it started out with kayako who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with some bloke and got herself dead. this part is still ok. because of this moment of rage, she became a vengeful spirit who kills anyone who enters her house. acceotable. now, her killings began to stretch a little where she actually had the opportunity to travel throughout tokyo just to finish her victims. (her victims were travelling, weren't they?) this struck me hard. now if a ghost could actually do such a thing like travelling throughout a country without paying public transport fares, i wouldn't mind being. ask someone to come kill me then *snorts*. and to crown things all up, the ghost who was once depicted as a very vengeful one (in ju-on: the grudge, which was way better than this trash) is now depicted as some spectre who truly enjoys herself and felt that it is her mission to finish of people. things became worse (for me, the viewer) when the ghost became coming in forms of large strands of hair. i mean, ??? if a ghost had such power, i seriously dun mind being one. i never really liked movies depicting ghosts as monsters cause they're not. the overall results is just plain bad. like the grudge 2. with a better storyline and less exaggeration, this show would have been better

i liked the first the grudge. it really creeped me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice. that something was missing from this sequel. there was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really sticks to your mind. it's people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo. and most of the time, it wasn't even all that scary.plot-wise this movie is a dead end. amber tamblyn is a good actress, but she was given nothing to do, and karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so quickly. i was also disappointed in the kayako's mother subplot. i was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the grudge, but she dies in the hands - hair? - of kayako. that was such a stupid twist. all in all, it's difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die. all in the same way. and there's nothing they can do. it doesn't feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them. it's just boring, because you know what's going to happen. if they had anything to fight it with, that would have added suspense, even if they failed. if there was any hope, it would make the scares more justified. now you're just waiting for them to die.kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it. i was still scared during some scenes, but i actually got used to the huge eye and blue face. the makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts. yes, i was scared at the school psychologist scene - even if i knew where it was going as soon as she said "i've been to the house". a nice touch. toshio, however, was not scary at all in this movie. i was much more creeped out by the non-blue toshio with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie. a blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me.some of the characters seemed really unnecessary - the notorious milk-scene with the girl whose name i can't even remember comes to mind. i wasn't scared, it was just "huh?" i'm not sure if the schoolgirls were even really needed. karen could have brought the grudge to the us with her. it could have killed people related to her life, everyone at the funeral, or something like that. even so, it would have been dull to watch them all die, but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying. hated the "i won't call you mother" scene. aubrey's mother issues were equally dull. the little boy was a touching character, though.the ju-on sequel was much scarier than this one. it had some new twists - dreams and reality blurring much more, for instance - and even if it left me feeling quite down, i was also somehow satisfied. i got to think a bit and be left wondering. this movie only provided cheap scares.

i would not deny that i have quite enjoyed watching any japanese horror films, but everyone must get quite fed up with them after you have seen the same thing over and over.the film follows the story of the grudge. audrey, as requested by her mom, is going to get her sister back. but when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed. she wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer (eason) joins her. on the other hand, there's also something happening to a family and three girls, but they seem to realise it too late...in fact, i can't see the points for the three girls from international school to appear in the movies as they're not (quite) related to the story. the reason why the woman holding the grudge keeps killing people is still not very clear (it seems to me they're just telling the same things i saw in the grudge). and the sudden appearance of audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly odd, which i suppose is an attempt to make the story about the family related. the killing scenes are absolutely the mixture of those in the ring and shibuya kaidan. the acting would be another bad point. as a hong konger i would really like to support edison chen's first effort in hollywood, but as a film lover i really can't find any point to support bad acting. other actors like the father , though he just appears in a few scenes, should also have done better. what is kept good is the atmosphere of the film, especially when i watched it in the middle of the night alone.if you have time, really enjoy any horror films and have seen all the possible horror films except this, like me, you can go for it to kill some time. but if you really like japanese horror films of this kind, you should spend some time watching the japanese version of the ring.

aubrey davis (amber tamblyn) travels to tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister karen (sarah michelle gellar) and gets caught up in the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people. with a group of others, she tries to solve and end the curse for good.the grudge 2 rehashes everything from the first one and it produces only a couple of scares. the first grudge was an average movie at best. the premise was decent but the acting was wooden and some of the scenes were really ridiculous. the grudge 2 is even more silly and less scary than the original. also, scary movie 4 has made it nearly impossible to take these films seriously and i had trouble keeping a straight face during the "scary scenes" which should encourage laughter more than fear. how takashi shimizu messed up his own franchise is unexplainable yet he succeeded at creating a decent atmosphere. unfortunately, he kept the film at a slow pace with a bunch of dull characters and lame scare tactics. clearly, he did this movie for money and i'm glad it failed.the screenplay was pretty bad, mainly because it made no sense and they didn't develop the characters at all. in the movie, there were three different stories going on and each of them were somehow related to "the grudge". the connections were weak and a bunch of people were killed without a real reason. they don't explain the rules of the curse very well and it ended up being a bit of blood bath because of everyone dying although the pg-13 rating kept things from getting interesting so even some of the death scenes were pretty lame. the dialog was weak and none of the characters were likable or developed well enough to truly care about.the acting was on par with everything else and it was a lot worse compared to the first one. amber tamblyn was annoyingly wooden. she moved on screen very slowly and all of her emotions seemed fake. sarah michelle gellar was okay although she just had a cameo. jennifer beals gave the best performance, she had a few good scenes and was kind of effective. arielle kebbel was okay, a little bland. the rest were either horrible or just too forgettable to mention. overall, the grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. it lacked a lot of things and it's not worth watching. rating 4/10

hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. take superheroes for example, for each x-man and spiderman, there are daredevil, elektra, ghost rider and hulk. japanese horror remakes are even worst. it only took the ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of mr. gore verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. the ring 2, the eye, dark water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges.the first grudge wasn't entirely bad. it was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy men in black ii? was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? for the grudge 2, the critic goes the same way.tired scares, bad acting (except for amber tamblyn), and clichés all over the place. three stories take place, on different places and time. there is aubrey (tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister karen (sarah michelle gellar) to death; allison (arielle kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. glad to say (and i mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.the chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn't enter a house, others that dig too deep. meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic. hey, doesn't that seem just like another bad japanese remake, something called pulse? yeah, day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge... against hollywood bullshits.

what a horrible movie. this movie was so out of order and so hard to follow.it was so hard to follow and was just confusing. the whole time i was watching it i was wishing it would end!!i felt like i wasted 2hours of my life that i will never get back. save your money and don't rent this movie. i now see why sarah michelle gellar was barely in the movie. the first movie was great but this was just sucked. i would never recommend this movie to anyone. save your money and watch the trailer because that is about the only thing that is worth seeing with this movie. this movie had no real story to it either. i am still wondering what i watched.

the grudge 2...let's see. don't get me wrong, i'm not a japanese horror film or horror or grudge basher. i loved the first one and the original ju-on. i feel that much more justice could have been done for this one. aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be 'discovered' in the ending, (which if you've already seen ju-on before this, you already know the whole movie) all it was really was a complete remake of ju-on, just more closely followed than the grudge. though everyone may have thought that it's coming to america was a bit interesting, it was expected as the house burning in the end of the grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot. save your $6.50 and wait for this to come out on dvd, rent it, watch it, then decide if you want to buy it. this movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film. but overall, i'd say a 4 out of 10. sorry grudge fans, it's just...they just failed at this one.

in pasadena, mrs. davis (joanna cassidy) sends her daughter aubrey davis (amber tamblyn) to tokyo to bring her sister karen davis (sarah michelle gellar), who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire, back to the usa. after their meeting, karen dies and aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets herself cursed in the same situation, being chased by the ghost of the house. meanwhile in tokyo, the three high school mates allison (arielle kebbel), vanessa (teresa palmer) and miyuki (misako uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost. in chicago, trish (jennifer beals) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend bill (christopher cousins), who lives with his children, the teenager lacey (sarah roehmer) and boy jake (matthew knight). on the next door, weird things happen with their neighbor."the grudge 2" has scary sound and visual effects, with the creepy woman and boy, and i have startled a couple of times while watching this movie. however, the complex screenplay with three subplots is totally confused, making the entwined story a complete mess. there are too much characters and situations, and in a certain moment i was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative. in the end, i was completely disappointed with this confused, but also spooky film. my vote is four.title (brazil): "o grito 2" ("the scream 2")

i bought this film at blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it. i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. i was 100% wrong.having watched it, i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (honestly! i don't usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to ray stevens' "would jesus wear a rolex on his television show"). this would barely qualify as pg-13 (it is not rated), but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream, but they insist that zack and reba is worse.it is, but not in that way.in a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like the virgin suicides), it's teenagers. if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect, then i have little chance of turning a story i've been writing into a pg-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (i think it's number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.

if i'm to like a movie, i need to care about the lead characters and what happens to them. in this waste-pod of a film, i found myself hoping that they would all die in the end. none of the characters are people that you'd ever want to meet, they all made me sick. if not for a few nude scenes, i would have given this wretched movie a 1.

although my exposure to world cultures is limited, i do try. this was a film that i tried and hated. worst of all, after hearing so many people decry the shallowness of typical hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, i saw characters too outrageous for "eastenders" being paraded as realistic.clint wants out of the drug life and to do this he aspires to be a waiter. aim high, i always say. brad dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or quite possibly a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to tell, offers to hire clint if he gets a pair of shoes.clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wander the whole of england trying to get him some shoes. eventually, they end up at a suburban home. whose isn't clear. mum helps a girl shoot up. oh, now there's some realism for you! mrs. brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of american housewives, but she never helped marsha tie off and find a vein. good god! dad comes home and sings some elvis tunes and then chases the kids away.why didn't clint borrow some money and buy shoes at a second hand store? why didn't he go to a church and ask a kindly nun for some help? why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and panhandle? i just don't know! none of these things seemed to be beneath him. benevolent groups, like goodwill and the salvation army have stores to help people. i know people who work there! if someone with no money showed up and needed shoes, the staff would give the person some shoes. maybe not prada or gucci, but some form of foot covering. not many of these groups hand out cell phones to the underprivileged, but shoes are usually no problem. what a dumb concept. the world, or at least the western part of it, simply isn't that cruel. in england, maybe it's from "the queen's royal charity" rather than goodwill, but people who need shoes do get them.aside from the quest for shoes, there was no discernable plot to get in the way of the action. not that it made the movie any quicker or more bearable, mind you. despite checking the tape jacket several times, i was not watching the 20-hour extended version, it only seemed that way.did clint get his shoes? did the cardboard cutout of brad dourif hire him at the restaurant? did i ever watch anything else foreign ever again?[spoiler] yes, yes, and yes.as for the fate of this particular film, i decided to end it all. i took out my s&w .45 and shot a half-inch hole through the cassette. blammo! (i made sure to rewind it first.) i put it back in the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental store, and amazingly no one ever called to ask about it!!! meaning, of course, that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years i lived in that city. others knew something that i didn't. live and learn.btw, if you rent something you've never seen before and someone has actually put a bullet through it, take it as a sign. and if you work at the kroger video department, i'm just kidding.footnote: this classic has yet to see the light of day on dvd, for which we should be eternally thankful to the digital gods.

i don't think the number of blunders militarily and strategically contained in this turkey can be beaten. everything in this mess was done on the cheap and made soldiers look really stupid. examples: at the start the 2-star general is given strategic advice by a lieutenant and accepts it unquestionably. the map used by the lt. shows enemy positions but they apparently have only a single narrow valley to use in advancing on the battalion (even though the map showed a dozen more). the rear guard takes up position from which they are clearly spotted by the enemy and exposed. they pound our heroes from high ground but this superior fire power makes little difference. an single enemy tank advances near the end (at the beginning referred to as armored division), proceeded by a solitary infantry point (!) who moves extremely slowly without cover scouting the area, then waives the tank on when he deems it save to proceed - a most bizarre scene. the soldiers take cover in a cave. all around them is ice and deep snow but in the cave not a yard from the entrance is a deep puddle through which they all wade repeatedly - their feet would last mere minutes before they freeze off. later the survivors wade pathetically slowly and chest high through a river to return to their unit. remember it is deep winter and the ground is frozen. yeah right!and on and on it goes. they yell commands to positions on higher ground, they lay mines near their own position and warn each other not to trample on them (!) at the start, credit is given to some soldier who had been awarded the congressional medal of honor. was he blind, or did director fuller just ignore him?truly the most inept soldiers i've ever seen. one of them pokes around in his own wounded leg with a bayonet and eventually pulls out a piece of shrapnel, without a wince or a moan. he announces that that should qualify him as a surgeon. now that was funny.

and i am afraid that i cannot imagine why. it really is a genuinely dire and exceptionally boring film. in some ways it is reminiscent of early science fiction when every set had been knocked up on a hollywood back lot out of whatever was lying around. from the minuscule and unconvincing set (snipers seem to be about ten meters away) apparently made of plaster, to the actors who are also apparently made of plaster with "amusing" stereotypes painted thinly on top, to the oddly warm pool in a frozen cave, to the survival of the cast uninjured when medium artillery shells burst a few meters away on open ground, and finally the awful script that reads like a training manual more than a film.... i really cannot say how dull this is. even the opportunity to see whether the young james dean survived wasn't enough to keep me watching for more than an hour. this really is one to be avoided at all costs.

watching this film made me wonder, just why was universal putting out films like this? they had a wonderful string of films with all the classic horror films. the dawning of the atomic age brought on an onslaught of giant creature films. spiders, ants, praying mantis'. with the deadly mantis, we have a giant praying mantis flying around the arctic, scaring eskimos, and being hounded by the armed forces. the bug reaches a tunnel in new york where the soldiers eventually destroy it. of course, this is all made much more watchable by viewing it on mst. who thought it was a good idea to start the film out by showing a giant map?

thirty per cent of this movie appears to be the prototype for the map channel. you see a giant map for about ten minutes, then they unleash the stock footage big time while droning(droning, get it?)on about radar. apparently there's a lot of radar stations in the far north, protecting north america's borders from attacks by deadly polar bears. the bears never show up, but a giant mantis does. it was frozen in the ice for over a million years or so, until it was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world(yeah, right. for my money, it was released by global warming). it is a huge prehistoric insect, and it needs lots of food. since there aren't any cows in the frozen north, it decides to feast on the most bovine-like creatures it can find up there. i.e., human beings. it starts attacking radar stations, probably because the humming from the radar dishes was getting on its nerves.enter col. joe parkman, the resident smarmy guy of the film. he's investigating a plane that went down, and is puzzled why there are no bodies in the wreckage. the only thing he finds is one of the claws of the mantis. apparently it decided to trim its nails while it was snacking on the plane's crew. parkman takes the claw tip back with him to be analyzed by a thousand year old scientist.grandpa scientist can't make heads or tails of the claw, mostly because he's missed his naps so his mind isn't functioning too well. so he calls in a smug paleontologist played by the guy who was the p.i. in perry mason. he and his friend, a transvestite photographer, fly north because he's decided that the claw must have come from a praying mantis. just one the size of a commuter train.it's luke warm love at first sight when col.parkman first sets eyes on the she-male photographer. the men at the base, obviously having been deprived for many years, think she's the hottest thing to come along since granny clampett. smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path of the mantis, which has devastated some stock footage of an eskimo village. it comes to the base looking for an after dinner snack, and crushes some cheap sets quite effectively. then it flies south and disappears.now comes the tense hours when the civilian ground observer core are called on to sweep the skies looking for anything large flying overhead. i doubt that in reality they would have been told that they were looking for a giant flying mantis that eats human beings, since that would haver caused a panic. probably they were told to look for a giant 727 that was painted green and hummed because its engine was out of tune.col. parkman goes up in a plane to try to shoot the mantis down, and botches the mission. the mantis lands in new york city, probably because it wanted to take in a show on broadway or visit sex world in times square. the army corners it in the tunnel, and parkman and his men don stupid suits that they borrowed from the orkin man to go in and try to blow the mantis up. success! well, almost, since the mantis is still twitching enough that it almost kills the mannish eve arden photographer lady. there's a tepid love scene at the end, and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because colonel hair grease and ms. gender unspecified are busy smooching. so kind of a nauseating ending.

so you're a giant mantis and you've been hanging out in the arctic for a while, and you're tired of eskimos hitting you with snowballs. what's a giant mutant insect to do? head for the big city, of course! see the sights, maybe catch a show on broadway. but wait! just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to call your own, some pesky humans start attacking you!! argh! time to smash!anyhow this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies, because it has pretty decent fx for 1957. but that's about it. avoid unless you really need to see another big bug smash things, or see another perry mason actor in a b movie.4/10

i got hold of a discount copy of this. i had seen it several years ago. my only recent experience had been "mystery science theatre" where it was soundly spoofed. one never really gets a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay. i love the beginnings of fifties horror movies. they give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the arctic. these were there to protect us from the expected soviet invasion, but they should come in handy, given the threat of very large insects. this particular one flies. for some reason, despite its exoskeleton made of the stuff grasshoppers are made of, they can still fend off air to air missiles and disable fighter planes. anyway, it's more fun--first, the obligatory deranged case who saw the flying thing, cooling his heels in a hospital (it just teaches one--see an insect as big as a house--keep your mouth shut). i wonder if the poor guy got to go home after they found the bug.otherwise, this is a pretty ordinary effort. it follows the usual efforts to come up with a way of dissuading the stubborn bug--and leaves us open to other possibilities--the russians next time. i still get a kick out of these films and this one is serviceable.

the deadly mantis certainly won't scare any one, but as sci-fi programmers go it is better than most. a volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant, prehistoric preying mantis at the north pole. military men go missing. dr. ned (william hopper--hedda hopper's son and best known as paul drake on television's perry mason) is called in to i.d. the creature--but by this time the creature has eaten up several eskimo and is en route to the washington monument.about a third or more of the film consists of stock footage: old government educational films, military men in radar rooms, air planes--and would you believe eskimos putting out to sea? which explains, of course, why a tribe of eskimo is attacked in the movie. ("hey, guys! think we can work this in?") mix in some negligible special effects, some clunky dialogue, and some sexist attitudes and you're good to go. not as original as the monster that challenged the world, but fans of 1950s "big bug" schlock will enjoy it--and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn at the screen.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

s l o w, l o n g, d u l l. . .oh my god, dull. characters so annoying - you'll cringe every time you see jimy smits, or the guy that played tomtom from now on. they must have never rehearsed or reviewed the film in progress. mel gibson was absolutely wooden.this may not be the worst movie ever made, but that it went almost straight to video says it is darn close.

i rented this movie on 20 june 2001, and watched it for about 45 minutes. i concluded that watching a blank screen would be delightful by comparison. there was not a single person in the cast for whom i would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened up and swallowed the whole bunch of them.so, i e-mailed all of my friends and relatives warning them, and i am taking the time to urge everyone who may see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! i have seen some really bad movies in my time, but never one as bad as this.

pretty pictures with a cool sound track do not constitute a 'movie'. like all pop promos, mdh's pretentions are are outdone only by its' unjustifiable budget. one dollar spent on this aimless, purposeless dross was one dollar too many. stick to penning pop songs bono.

it's the one film i almost walked out of, and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me. normally, even if i don't like a film, i think it's still worth sitting through it to the end. that way, you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself. but with the million dollar hotel, it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. i think i probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director, one i didn't normally like so much. but coming from wenders, it was all the more shocking to behold. i know bono from u2, a good friend of wenders's, wrote the script to this abysmal film, and i wonder why wenders let him, as buddy-buddy as the two may have been. "stick to the day job, bono", is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess. pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring, with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon, especially the leads, jeremy davies, milla jovovich and mel gibson, none of whom i dislike normally. the happiest ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible. on a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely stirring soundtrack from u2. but the film's opening shots make the rest of the film (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on) all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered, not even close.

perhaps i'm just a simple person, but i prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. i couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. this was supposed to be a comedy? maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level). the thing about it is, it missed on so many things. there were characters that could have been funny, but they weren't. there were characters that you could have liked, but you didn't. for instance, the guy who thought the beatles ripped off his songs. there was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a beatle and complain about how they ripped him off. haha. and the previous poster talked about the 'i am the walrus' scene like it was special. what? he played 'i am the walrus' on an old piano and sang out of tune. is there an inside joke there? it sure stank at face value. this movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art/garbage message the artist is expressing. if you want to be entertained, stay away.

this movie just stunk. i know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good "just doesn't get it." i like wenders in american friend and wings of desire. but this is utter dreck. the main character is so annoying that i couldn't care less what he does. he is, as has been said in another review bouncing around like a little annoying monkey. i just couldn't stand him or force myself to care. this is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be goofey or weird. i liked the mel gibson character and the milla jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them. milla is of course beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is. i see gibsons character as almost frankenstien like. i just wish he would have save milla and brunt the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it. milla rating 10 movie rating 0

even mel gibson couldnt save this slop of a movie. this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. why would mel gibson make a movie that im sure he couldnt sit and watch? what was this? a total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a schizophrinic lady, who was also on some heavy ilicit street drugs. for all the moviegoers out there on heavy drugs; you will love this movie.

riccardo freda may have a good reputation; but since we now that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great mario bava; it's clear that he wasn't one of italy's most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies. this film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot; it's a sprawling mess and overall, i'd even have to go as far as to say that tragic ceremony is worse than freda's insipid giallo effort, the iguana with the tongue of fire. freda apparently disowned this movie, and i certainly don't blame him! the plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. they happen upon a house while searching for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremony...ho hum. the film features a lead role for camille keaton, who would go on to star in the exploitation classic i spit on your grave some years later, but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers. the film features one decent gore scene towards the end, but this really isn't enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there. i have a high tolerance for rubbish italian films that don't make sense - but even i couldn't stand this one. miss it, miss nothing!

on the way home from a day at the beach, four young people seek shelter from a torrential downpour at the home of lord and lady alexander after their car runs out of gas. they don't know it, but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a satanic ritual. jane (camille keaton), the only female of the group, is to be sacrificed. as her male companions rush to her aid, one of them accidentally kills lady alexander. things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed. the four try to make an escape, but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed. one by one, they meet their fates.gong into tragic ceremony, i was positive i would enjoy it. slow-burn gothic horror is right up my alley. i'm also quite fond of some of riccardo freda's other movies like the horrible dr. hichcock, the ghost, and i vampiri. tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. unfortunately, things don't always work out the way they should. the biggest tragedy with respect to tragic ceremony is the time i spent watching this mess of a movie. with a few minor exceptions, nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me. the characters are unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pacing is terrible. there's a subplot about some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further. in addition, nothing interesting happens for most of the movie. by the time the four leads realize they're in danger, i was well past the point of caring. and i don't understand the reviews i've read that praise the acting of camille keaton. i suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an emotionless daze to be acting. the three male leads are the very definition of nondescript. they do nothing to stand out. the supporting cast includes some genre favorites like luigi pistilli, luciana paluzzi, and paul muller, but none is given anything to do. in fact muller's main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes. it's a weak attempt to provide a wrap-up to a very weak movie.

this late-ish effort from freda plays as a modern day (70's that is) gothic thriller, but comes out short of thrills. certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film, it's jut got that feeling which many of freda's later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first daily's. it starts out good enough, almost giallo like in tone, then takes a turn into gothic territories with a decent (albeit terribly cliché) set up. then suddenly freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of camille keaton and burning candles. then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent-to-poor special effects. this is followed by a slow paced outro with a very obvious twist ending (if it's even intended to be a twist?). and throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony. thus in parts it's got its qualities. but then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you. a pity.btw stay away from the sharoma dvd, a useless murky pan& scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience.

i will repeat - what a stupid scenario.is there anything new inside? i don't know who have wrote this. but i believe this guy have watch all hollywood -children -family -teens movies ever made... all scenes and dilouges u can see in everywhere. why do u people making this movies? children's like an adults? they like money gold cars... and they are positives? they have lucky... and emotions of course... without it can be done. o the young actors - wow :-). i do like when is camera concentrated on their nice faces? what a crap... there is 90% better children movies that this one! this is not creative or funny movie. this is simply nothing.d.

this is one of those "family" movies that i can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9. a group of siblings discovers a "sand fairy" (yes, really) conveniently located at the end of a not-so-secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle, to which they've been evacuated from the london blitz. ...and there you have it, all in one sentence. the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled, but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children (or vice versa!). the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie highmore's outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.

the great war breaks out and daddy is a brave pilot who goes off to carry out some unsightly business to put jerry in his place. mummy is doing her bit as a nurse, so the five children are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the country, where a secret passageway takes them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure.based on a book written the best part of a century ago, they don't make stories like this anymore. and there's a reason. the men fly planes and author books; the women change bandages and clean house. the boys lead the way with their compasses and nighttime furloughs; the girls do what they are told and play violin - badly. fat kids who wear specs are nasty. all the kids speak in those clipped, vowel-flattening accents that are soppy and prim but which a certain economic class of english people cultivate. on top of the snobbery and yearning for imperial albion, there are plot holes a five-year-old would not tolerate. i mean that literally - my son was asking why the father disappeared before sunset, why the compass didn't just drop from his hand as he disappeared. the film at least tries to aim strictly for the kids, until a completely inappropriate and unfunny monologue by eddie izzard (what a waste of genuine comic talent) plays over the final credits.no doubt the five percent of british schoolkids who go to expensive public schools in the uk will find it all such a jolly wheeze. for the other 95 percent of british families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is wall-e, ratatouille and wallace and gromit are all out on dvd.

1st watched 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10(dir-john stephenson): mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight & work in world war i as england entered the war. they are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncle's mansion, which of course they do over and over, and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down. this is the "it" referred to in the title, created by the jim henson group and voiced by eddie izzard. the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from. this part of the movie is not done very well because it's obvious the children, primarily the freddie highmore character, do not learn from them but instead keep going back to "it" to solve their next big problem. "it" is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well, which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers. so, all in all, this was an ok film but could have been much better.

i would think that this was one of those films whose director hadn't read the book it was based on, were it not for the fact that they are just slightly similar. it is certainly possible for a great film to be "based" very loosely on a book and this was certainly the latter but not the former.there were a number of flaws. one was that it tried to be too much like the railway children, probably because adults would expect this, being from the same author. another is that it also sought to be too like harry potter, down to the music and in overemphasizing the setting. i have nothing against j k rowling or the films but the book is just nothing like the harry potter ones. i thought the psammead, though very well voiced by eddie izzard and in character too, was almost gratuitously in a totally inappropriate environment. i may have missed something here, as the comments made about one of the characters' own books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. there was also no need for the extra characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but they weren't.i saw this film with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other of whom doesn't. the one who does know it thought it was all right but wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't. i'm not sure what this means.

schieder delivers a semi-believable part as the president of the united states with politically correct maria conchita alonzo as the female vice president. the movie just stinks. with so many plot holes its a wonder they got it to stick to the film it was shot on. relegated to late night hbo time schedules, this film is not worth seeing at all. 10 minutes into it, you are asking yourself why it was written. 40 minutes into it, you are wondering why you are watching it. save the effort and watch a re-run of hee haw or something. anything is better than this clunker.

ugh. this movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess. the story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable. we're actually supposed to believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and allow the president of the united states to be put at unbelievable risk. if this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the president's protectors, then we're all in trouble. roy scheider turns in a good performance as the president, but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of patrick muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk). perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise--or, perhaps someone will see it and say, "hey, if they can get a movie this bad made, maybe i can, too!"

i probably have to blame myselfbut i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title "black dragons" and revolves on secret wwii conspiracies, nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. this film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. the actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. we see how horror icon bela lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent american politicians and kills them one by one. the story is timed right before wwii and  especially after witnessing the ending  it surely is a premise with lots of potential, so it's quite a shame it isn't elaborated more proper. there is however one great dialogue that i can't resist sharing! man towards woman: "do you want to marry me?" "why?" "so i can beat you upit's the only way you'll leave this place!" it's the only highlight in an overall very boring movie. bela lugosi is lovely  as usual  but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film. if you're interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his (in movies with decent screenplays), check out "invisible ghost", "the corpse vanishes", "white zombie" and of course the 1931 dracula version.

this was a strange film. a bit horror and certainly film noir. some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously start dying off with a japanese dagger in their hands after monsieur colomb (bela lugosi) shows up.soon the lone ranger arrives in the person of fbi agent richard 'dick' martin (clayton moore). martin is ineffective in finding the killer as he is more interested in the niece (joan barclay) of a missing doctor, who is part of the gang.after the last man dies, and the doctor is horribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and that is where it gets interesting and weird. i won't spill it.lugosi was marvelous as the skulking killer.

"black dragons" is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time. it's not as bad as some would have you believe. a secret meeting hosted by the respected dr. william saunders (george pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names monsieur colomb (bela lugosi). shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese embassy in washington. colomb is suspected. federal agent dick martin (clayton moore) is assigned to the case and meets saunders niece alice saunders (joan barclay) who tries to assist him. the reasons behind colomb's actions are not explained until the final reel. until all is explained at the end, the story is hard to comprehend.  lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies, is actually quite good in this one. he is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director william nigh. lugosi's character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes. clayton moore, a one dimensional actor at best, would become tv's lone ranger in a few years. joan barclay makes a good heroine. although a little dated now, "black dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.

this film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. the pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for bela lugosi). the audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. if these things bother you at all, don't watch this film.if you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one. a german plastic surgeon (bela lugosi) was hired by the japanese to operate on several japanese agents and turn them into the likenesses of upstanding american businessmen whom the japanese have kidnapped and killed. after completing his work, he was betrayed by the japanese and thrown into prison. he later escapes and travels to america to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly-publicized murders.it seemed as though bela lugosi was the only decent actor in the film, and, to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy. the leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned to her case was the common, chauvinistic and always correct dominant male that is found in many films of this time period. i also found that the camera work was completely uninspired, often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again. after a while, this tends to drag the film down, setting a very slow pace for the "action," which is more or less non-existent anyway.to me, the idea is a fascinating one, and with a better writer, director, script, equipment, and actors it could become an excellent film. sadly, these handicaps keep the film back for now, and i can't recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers.

poor bela lugosi. just another day at work. a group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the american war effort from the inside. it's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. there are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. a police force that doesn't know what is going on. what a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. there are comments like, "a true patriot would do this or that." it's obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldn't know a spy or a subversive if it jumped up and bit them. i also was surprised to see clayton moore (the lone ranger) in a romantic role. i never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse. there is, of course, the smugness of the criminals as they think that they are immune from the killer's guest list. anyway, bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one. the best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil it. as a curiosity, and a period piece, it may be fun to watch for some people.

mgm hodgepodge of jimmy durante throwing a big party for everybody in hollywood. no major stars show up--we get the three stooges, laurel & hardy, durante and lupe velez. i didn't recognize anyone else--they were probably unknowns (for good reason). the movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography. the only things that save this from being a total disaster are laurel & hardy's "battle" with lupe velez and a wonderful color disney cartoon called "the hot chocolate soldier". it's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost. otherwise, the movie is a colossal bore. there's no director credited--what does that tell you?

i wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to european wimps and the united nations. what a load of right-wing crud! incidentally, the bit about canada joining the us didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. the only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for president(but they could have just made him american and dispensed with that). in any event, this was a load of bull and not worth your time. if you wan't to see this kind of thing done well, check out the brilliant bbc political thriller "state of play."

no spoiler needed to steer you clear of this...well, bizarre film. canada becomes part of the usa. ok. so, i guess i'm unusual, but i expected something about the implications of canada becoming part of the usa. silly me. continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land. the opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will (trust me) not care a squat for any of the characters. slings and arrows and due south have to be among the most imaginative series ever. but in this case, paul gross, i'm so very sorry to say, didn't have a clue about making a coherent film and wasted a lot of talented actors in the process. a real disappointment.

there could be some spoilers ahead but i doubt it. i have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. it's horrible. completely unwatchable. i hung in there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and just couldn't stand it anymore. i was an elijah wood fan in the '90s (see "the war") and i learned to enjoy mandy moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see "chasing liberty" which is surprisingly entertaining). i've seen bits of "run lola run." so with three leads i liked this should have been fine. it wasn't. nobody turned in a good performance. wood's jones was flat. for an aspiring writer he had next to no imagination (his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from "a christmas story" and his lustful ones were--huh, a cross between boring and alarming). potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and i'd only know that she was supposed to be "the girl" by reading the box. speaking of the synopsis--whoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny, quirky, romantic, and quite enjoyable. whoever that person was, he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script. by the halfway point, i didn't care about any of the characters anymore. moore's lisa is an aspiring actress who's bubbly and a little conniving (for no apparent reason at all) but her ludicrous period play (which is supposed to be funny in presentation) is on a par with the rest of the script. there is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy ending to this turkey--given the character material they had to work with, i just can't envision it. save your money. warn your friends. don't watch this movie.

i found this movie to be a complete waste of 96 minutes. jones was a weird kid and is severly messed up! according to my memory which might be wrong, wasnt he only 16 or 17 years old? **spoiler** why did he leave college and rent an apartment with a two crazy girls who feud over boys for a pasttime? and the cowboy who lives underneath jones creeped me out too, how he knew what happened in the apartments didnt float past me for a minute. i do not understand his thinking about the girl that took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when mandy moore was always over and is was quite obvious that she wanted to be more than friends with him. i dont really find this movie funny or artsy or dramatic or anything, i found it to be stupid and a complete waste of time (d- f+)

having loved stephen king's novels and short stories for many years, i, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works. a few notable exceptions are "stand by me" from "the body", "carrie" from the novel of the same name, and "the shawshank redemption" from "rita heyworth and shawshank redemption". this movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with stephen king's name attached to it in any way. it is no surprise that mr. king has pretty much disavowed any connection with it. i feel the thing that most offended me about this poorly acted, cheaply filmed, hideously directed piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to completely change the ending don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow-wow of a movie!!

the first word i can find to describe this movie is awful.this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. first of all is the plot a very thin plot (wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. this makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. one of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: what the hell are the kids doing in that corn!!!!!!!!!! thirdly is the characters very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. they are bad as they can be.the last thing that make this movie bad, is that its a horror movie. you are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you are not scared, you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen.conclusion: the movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! i hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary, the movie is best unseen.

a traveling couple (horton and hamilton)stumble onto the town of gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they're separated and peter horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of king's best short stories. in the original story king managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful. also the effective ending used in the story is in favor dumped for a happy ending which makes the overall impact mute. there is some atmosphere and stylish directing but no plot to back any of it up. the kids are woefully unconvincing also.1/5 matt bronson

i'm sorry, but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi classic and a scary movie, but seriously, i think when the director has me laughing unintentionally, that's not a good thing. the characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable. i just couldn't stop laughing at issac's voice, it was just like a high pitched whiny girl's british voice. not to mention malicai's over dramatic stick up his butt character.children of the corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a god that commands them to sacrifice any 20+ aged people. when a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help, but of course they get caught in the kid's trap and are getting sacrificed! but malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following issac's orders.children of the corn could've been something great, but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of. as much as i love stephen king, i'm sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors destroyed it. like i said, for a good laugh, watch it, but i'm warning you, it's pretty pathetic.3/10

while this is horribly dated, i must insist...please, no remake! frankly, it just won't help, as there's nothing which could be added or changed, contemporarily, to make this cinematically better.the novel upon which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. most of king's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. i'm not sure why this is, but when you view this work, if you view it, you are likely to see just what i mean. the book? it's wonderful. it's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just entertaining. the movie? do something else. you can thank me later.it rates a 3.1/10 from...the fiend :.

i must admit, ashamed though i am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. nine years after first viewing stephen king's frightening story however i have now come to my senses, and am able to assess fritz kiersch's work more reasonably.indeed king's tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid. a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the finale into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare.the cast are reasonable, but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible, over the top movie will allow them, and the soundtrack by jonathan elias is spookier than the pictures.a real shame that george goldsmith's screenplay turned stephen king's haunting short story into a shocking horror. isaac, malachai and all the other "children of the corn" aren't really all that scary.sunday, august 7, 1994 - video

nearly everything that stephen king has ever written seems to have been turned into a film or tv series; in fact, i'm surprised that no one has tried to make a mini-series from the guy's grocery list. let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be any less interesting than children of the corn.based on one of king's many short stories, this 1984 horror flick sees linda hamilton and peter horton playing a couple on a long car journey who run into a spot of bother when they chance upon the sleepy nebraska town of gatlin, where all of the adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the corn fields.although director fritz kiersch does manage to build a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after hamilton's silly song and dance, but before we get to meet the freakish isaac, leader of the killer kids), he completely blows it with endless unexciting scenes in which hamilton and horton are hunted down by the town's homicidal half-pints. courtney gains, as violent redhead malachai, manages to appear genuinely menacing, but the rest of the children are not the least bit threatening; as a result, many of the film's 'scary' moments fail to work. towards the end of the film, when we finally get to see the malevolent force that inhabits the field surrounding gatlin, the film descends into a glut of terrible 80s visual effects that probably looked pretty ropey almost 25 years ago, but look positively laughable nowadays.children of the corn might be of interest to king fans keen to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but your average horror-film fan will be most unimpressed.

unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when i read the positive reviews of this film; i cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad.i admit it is not my kind of movie, but i tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.the acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and i'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible. it is the worst film i have seen in many a year, in fact, i wouldn't even call it a film, it's a tragedy. the gay black friend, whom no-one actually calls "gay", it's just implied because he's so crazy? homophobic. this is not good, in fact, this is downright vomit inducing. the jokes die on their pathetic arses, the music is so bad it defies belief. the person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most ear-mutilatingly bad songs they had ever heard and put them in this waste of film stock. oh my good christ i can't believe the 80's produced utter garbage like this, i grew up through them, and i cannot find one thing worth of note here, it must have been a dark time to be a cinema-goer.if you even contemplate watching this film go see a psychiatrist, he will then accordingly slap you, you sick, sick person.

yumiko (wakana sakai), the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; her uncle kazuo (shun sugata), miffed that he wasn't left the business to run, orders a hit on his niece. when jug-eared chef kensuke (takashi okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man invincible (jung yuen), he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill yumiko. instead, he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her. however, she is kidnapped by kazuo's men while kensuke is preoccupied playing an arcade game with cop daniel (sam lee).uncle kazuo keeps yumiko in a hypnotic trance, and takes control of the business, but runs into a spot of bother himself, when his gangster pals threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he allows them total control.meanwhile, kensuke teams up with two martial arts experts, lam kau (yuen baio) and lam doi (candy lo) who are hunting invincible. he learns kung fu and attempts to free yumiko.a mixture of broad slapstick humour, spoofery and fight scenes, no problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved: 80s kung fu superstar yuen baio manages a few fight scenes but is getting a little old for acrobatics these days; director kar lok chin delivers the kind of dumb parody schtick i'd expect from a scary movie film; jung yuen resorts to mocking his character in operation scorpio; and sam lee well, sam lee is as annoying as always!on the other hand, collin chou, as gangster ben, impressed me; he has an obviously strong screen presence which has not gone unnoticed by hollywoodhe has since starred in two of the matrix movies and is soon to appear in d.o.a., directed by corey yuen. i was also impressed by wakana sakai, but for an entirely different reason: this beauty is easy on the eye and should go much further in the film business.there is some fun to be had from working out what movies are being parodied, but at 104 minutes i found this film a real chore to sit through. if people pulling funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects makes you burst your sides laughing, then no problem 2 might appeal to you. otherwise, i would leave well alone.

dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard. she traps him into bringing her back with him.glynis johns, in the title role, is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out.margaret rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here. in fact, miss rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts.nice to see david tomlinson in the film. he would get together with johns in the far superior "mary poppins," 16 years later.miranda causes mischief in that two guys, a neighbor's fiancée and chauffeur (tomlinson) fall for her.ask any mermaid you happen to see, what's the best tuna, chicken of the sea! as for this film, forget it.

seriously... i'm amazed at all the good feedback this show has here. all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do occasional funny things only in like... 2 of the shows, while most of the others sucked... as then they comment on music videos which i cannot stand personally while they either love or like.in most episodes, the only things you will hear are the repitive "let's go score with some chicks", or "i'll kick your ass beavis", or the better yet and usually used quote "that was cool", and above all, their annoying laugh.if you want a good animated show, try the simpsons, ren and stimpy, south park, this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful mtv series truthfully.

according to milan kundera, a porcelain-cat holding a red rose is denying the crap. well, those criminals guilty of making this series probably wanted to show how to make a total opposite of the porcelain-cat holding a red rose. because teenaged sleazoids beavis and butthead are enthusiastically from the place where the sun doesn't shine and their crappiness infects the whole stoopid series. mtv has received a lot of bad-mouthing from it's half-nude stripper beauties, while this is gathering positive reviews in imdb. well, newsflash to everybody - your butt is cool too, if you go out showing it in the middle of the winter - something these two probably would do. still, there is no need to make a film about your butt - and yes, these two probably would do that, too.

i don't care if this show is suppose to be communicating profound messages about human existence.the show is crap....how can anyone derive pleasure from watching it? yet it was received so well. this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out there.i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it. the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry.it is beyond belief that people can watch this show. yet i guess the creators had the last laugh....making themselves wealthy by taking the p.ss out of the very people that would watch a show such as this.i would wager they are laughing all the way to the bank.

i still remember when frog baseball first aired on mtv. in some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that i think every boy growing up in america engages in. i cringe now thinking about how i burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. growing up in the 1980s we all knew "stoners." these were the kids who wore iron maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two. we laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned. so it was easy to understand beavis & co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. to the extent that genxers like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, beavis & co were sort of a strange post-modern anthem for us. strange because like beavis & co we didn't care if we had an anthem. it was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful.

i tried. i really, really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two. it's not that i don't "get it" -- i'm a big fan of asian cinema. the truth is, the movie is infantile in construction, long-winded, and painfully disjointed.i suppose that if you are of alfred hitchcock's school of thought "don't tell them, show them," then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be hard pressed.first of all, the terrorizers tries stream-of-consciousness in the style of jean-luc godard and fails in this. edward yang seems to understand the basics of the technique, but he's very unskilled at it. (perhaps he gets better with age; i don't know as i haven't yet attempted other yang films.) the point is, he uses a dearth of "show, don't tell" that really only serves to interrupt the procession of the story. sure, he gets in some visually arresting images, but they don't draw the story together, and they don't help to make it any better.additionally, the major concept behind stream-of-consciousness and "show, don't tell" is that with the right images, the right drama, repetition, and tight correlation, the viewer will be able to make his or her own inferences; not to say that these will be the correct inferences, but those can be amended as the story progresses, and every director should strive for some of this type of audience interaction. in this, edward yang sorely disappoints. the viewer is constantly on the periphery. there is no reason to be drawn in, no reason to consider the characters or their motives, no reason to get emotionally involved, and really, no reason to stay alert.finally, yang gets lost in the story that he wants to tell, not the story that the movie itself is telling. his art moves in one direction, but like a large dog he can't control, he's constantly yanking the lead, trying to get it back onto the course he wants, not the one that it is naturally following. the most egregious example of this is the ending. the ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband's revelation. the ending of the book that the movie is focusing on, (and by extension, a possible ending for the movie) has already been told to us. if yang had chosen to end at that point, he would have had a much more powerful piece, leaving the watcher in suspense -- does the story play out as the book says, or does yang's "real world" play out differently? asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that yang painfully needs. instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what? for the sheer sake of lingering on a main character -- we didn't' need to know more about her superficially, and yang wouldn't feel the need to tell us if he hadn't made her into a veneer instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with. why else does yang prolong and torture his movie? to get in some more of those "visually arresting images." the movie truly suffers for it. it wants to end, it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unsettled, but instead, yang pushes on. instead, yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer on, causing him or her to constantly ask "so what?" the first ending, the one that yang ignored, that was good. the second ending, well, my thought was"so what, who cares?", because it's not as if it is introducing something that hasn't been put forth in the storyline already... but the last ending? that really was a waste of time. not only did the "real" ending leave me disengaged, but i also felt it was an affront to what the story could have been. yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum-melancholy-noir-tinged conclusion that he had insisted upon all along.my last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself, but rather its post-production. the subbing (if you see it subbed) is horrible. long sentences stay up for a second or two, while short ones stay up far too long. also, as yang quickly changes images, the subtitles are removed from the screen. this is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed, because there's not much dialog going on anyway.

realty television crew are assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and hoody. lots of interviews where the members of the crew(and some of the locals who live in the town of white plains where most of this film is set)talk into the camera about each other, those they encounter in the town of white plains, their current situations, and the showbiz side of their lives. the screenplay is often acidic, cynical, and caustic and killer movie essentially pokes fun at realty television shows, featuring a cast of characters one might find on the real world. if this plot is attractive to you, knock yourself out. i found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat. out of the cast, paul wesley, the director needing a big break, encountering more than he could possibly bargain for, jake tanner, is a nice guy, coming off very likable and tolerant of the crap he must contend with, considering the prima donnas and immature people in his entourage who often cause nothing but migraines. particularly irksome is his producer lee(cyia batten), a tyrant constantly barking orders to everyone, her poisonous attitude creating much tension..she's the type of producer who wishes to capitalize on a small town eruption regarding the killer, using the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy occurring in white plains. those familiar with kaley cuoco know that by now she has perfected the pampered princess, got it down pat because it's the only role we ever see her in most of the time. as blanca, she's polarizing the way she demands attention, milking what little celeb status she has to the hilt, manufacturing much friction as she becomes a source of frustration, and has quite the potty mouth(cuoco may've taken the part just so she could escape her usual television sitcom roles, allowed to spout profanity without restriction) cuoco, along with the entire cast, services killer movie as eye candy, but it's hard to find any character you wouldn't want to see hacked to pieces with a meat cleaver. jason london is the sound/equipment guy, a real creep with a sour attitude, often tormenting the others with his foul comments that are uncalled for. we witness lots of personality clashes, watching how these self-absorbed hollywood types in the cast snipe at each other. the killer's identity shouldn't surprise anyone, it's quite blatantly obvious. some minor gore, but most of the violence is shot off-screen. despite some tame lesbianism, not even this is satisfying. leighton meester pops up in the film as a cute victim. director/writer jeff fisher assembles quite an attractive cast, but i wouldn't be able to distinguish this from the innumerable slashers that have stocked the horror shelves over the last ten or so years since scream. while i've never liked any of cuoco's characters, i never tire of looking at her, but eventually she needs to come up with a role that doesn't consist of her preening, with smug arrogance, always whining and complaining.

first of all, let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like i'd been sold a bill of goods. mind you it's not the movie's fault that imdb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although i don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, i checked it out based on that and i'm so, so sorry i did. where to start? first of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie. it tries once or twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. my reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. also, there's no horror here. not a second of tension can be found. you think i'm exaggerating...i am not. no tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). hell...there's even zero nudity. call me a purist or juvenile...i prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise. and that tired as all hell "reality tv show gone wrong thing"? it's been done before and a lot better. like wrong turn 2 or...ummm....whatever that movie was called with edward furlong. that's how bad this movie is. i don't even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. i also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because "reality tv is taking over". did someone from the past post that with a time machine? are you freaking kidding me? this thing is trash...and not in a fun way.

sebastian cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oil--though none of the locals are aware of the oil. with the help of an evil gunfighter in black, they kill and terrorize everyone. when the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to back down and stands up to these forces of darkness.wow. as i watched terror in a texas town, i felt as if i'd seen this film many times before and would probably see something like it again. that's because aside from a few novelties (such as sterling hayden using a harpoon on the bad guy), it has a plot that is too familiar. once again, we've got a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the farmers in order to gain control of all the land. and, to do so, he's brought in hired guns to force people to sell or kill them. been there, done that in just too many films.i love sterling hayden in films, but just couldn't recommend this as anything other than a poor time passer.

big (and we mean plus sized big) baddie sebastian cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights. when sea faring sterling haden's pop is killed, how will haden put an end to terror in a texas town, armed only with a harpoon? first off, this isn't a b-western. there are no singing cowboys, no daredevil stunts, no interesting action sequences. it's just an independent movie -- you know, the ones that use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general low budget vapidity of the goings on with interesting camera angles.second, this movie, to avoid compromises (one expects) that would cause the elimination of trumbo's important statements about justice in america, and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl, is really low budget. the main problem that causes is that the acting is really, really bad. sterling haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the west. sebastian cabot tries to do a sydney greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. it's not a bad idea, but cabot does not have the acting chops for it. the guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (johnny crale) has the best role in the film. he does nothing with it.third, the script really isn't all that. trumbo gets some digs in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town, and the people, when up against real oppression tend to back down. this is a pretty stale movie message by 1958 -- high noon, bad day at black rock, devil's doorway -- are all westerns that deal with the evils of western society with an eye to the evils of 50s america. trumbo, in '59, certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments, but he isn't doing anything new or interesting with them.so, given all the negatives, why does this movie get a 4? mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie. (the relationship between crale and his girl is, um fascinating.) and trumbo, while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations, is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. just when one is ready to pass out from indy movie boredom, will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack.if you don't like trumbo or westerns, give this one a miss. otherwise, try it. you might like it more than i did.

for a horror film, this is criminally dull. a few memorable, gruesome bits can't compensate for a really poor script. very little coherence is achieved, and the movie relentlessly overplays its one basic idea (a killer cat), until it becomes repetitive - and things are made even worse by the constant use of shots from the cat's point-of-view. (*1/2)

predictable, cliche, unbelievable, boring...what else can i say? it's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. oh yeah, and the entertaining end zone antics.but wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the globetrotters/washington generals matchup.i was well into the second act before i figured out these were supposed to be pro teams we were watching (all clad in vintage padres brown). and cameron diaz character's imitation of a youthful georgia frontiere was ill-conceived on the page. (not your fault, cameron. would you like to go to dinner?)enough of this - i'm only on a rant because i was looking forward to this film. rent the longest yard instead.

stone has tried another type of movie. any given sunday falls short of a the above average the last boy scout and the below average against all odds. stone can be fantastic, see the doors, natural born killers or platoon but he can also repeat himself see nixon or born on the fourth of july. his real brilliance is realized in the michael caine perfection, the hand.

although this was the first hunter s. thompson documentary i have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as johnny depp, bill murray, gary busey, and a few others. i was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. what kept me watching was some of the old clips from fear and loathing in las vegas and where the buffalo roam. not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. i still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half. still if your a fan i would you'll like anything that has to do with hunter. best regards

this is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party i go to. it is clear from the start that steve gutenburg was taking this role seriously.... the other principles were walking through their lines. i think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks. sean bean "acted" as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was. some actors do not look good scruffy. some actors should not bulk up for a part. those two statements apply to "police academy" steve. his scruffy look translates to bum and indigent and his bulking up makes him look potato lumpy not buff. pair that with one of the worst scripted dialogues in hollywood history and you have bad movie. i can only guess that all of the principles really really needed the money for remodeling or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys that must of typed it out. i would love to know the back story to this disaster.

**might contain spoilers**ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. two words? really bad. now why do i think that? let me explain. guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. they do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. however, suspicions arise about guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. after debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved. after deciding they cant trust their bosses, they decide to, once again, steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackers.in theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low-budget movie that just aims to be aired on tv. however, the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts. firstly, the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes. second. the acting is really bad, or the actors are directed to act as dummys. there aren't many emotions, change of facial expressions at all etc. i was especially disappointed in guttenberg that i believe can do so much more, but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action-hero. in addition, though i am not by any means any expert on the subject, i totally believe i could assemble a better covert-ops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week. this seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible. this go for good guys, bad guys and bystanders as well. then i sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. for example, i have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and i didn't break instantly.don't know how to conclude this really, but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do. sorry, can't be any nicer than that. do not watch this movie, it is not even so bad it is funny. 2/10

a cut above from the usual straight to video actioneer, airborne has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes, although you can't help but think of how low former '80's comedy golden boy steve guttenburg has stooped to be in such a cheap production (and playing a hard man too!). the plot is simple, the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it, not bad of its kind but not in the same league (obviously) as the films it is compared too on the cover such as air force one and con air. the cast is good though, with sean bean reprising his brit.-bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as goldeneye and patriot games.

*****i reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film. do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason*****oh my, this is bad. and for some reason, sean bean, one of the greatest present day actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. the only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as steve guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as sean bean. instead, he is killed in what must have seemed like a marvellous twist at the end, by the good guy who was meant to be be killed by bean, but was actually his boss and faked his own death. don't worry. i haven't ruined anything for you. the acting itself is spectacularly apalling, with guttenberg's patented "hey-look-i-can-pull-a-chuck-norris-face" hard man stare dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth. added to a plot that i could have written whilst being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that one moment the virus will escape if they so much as look at it wrong, while another moment, steve guttenberg is bravely running around with it, throwing, catching bashing and generally abusing this 'virus' which has the distinct look of a collection of those little balls of soap you put in your bath. my final word? if you are suicidally depressed and feel like you want to laugh manically at something that should be a bad comedy but even worse isn't, tape it next time it's on channel 5 at midnight, then burn it when you realise that i am indeed telling the truth.

this film suffers horrendously from its direction "julian grant" , and its incompetent lead, steve guttenberg, who's putting a solid effort to win a bruce willis look-alike contest! the writing is reckless hollywood action thriller; sean bean --whose one of my favorites-- david fraser, and kim coates give a decent performance. the film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! i wonder what hollywood studios thought, actually giving the go ahead, to weak director such as grant. and i'd say to sean bean "what were you thinking even considering participating in a film like this, after such great films like goldeneye, ronin, and patriot games!

i love most movies and i'm a big fan of sean bean so i thought that i would at least like this movie. also, i'm canadian and this is a mostly-canadian movie so i was prepared to cut it some serious slack. nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is "airborne". steve guttenberg as an action hero? give me a break. the acting throughout the movie was so bad i am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. i now have only two wishes in my life.1. i hope that you never have to sit through this movie. 2. i wish i could get those 6 hours back. oh wait, the movie's under 2 hours - it only seemed like 6 hours...don't watch this. seriously.
