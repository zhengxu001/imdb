even worse then the incredibly boring "the exorcism of emily rose". it started off decently, and right up until the mom said to the dad, "see i knew she was possessed", in an i told you so voice. it was a terrible line, spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie. every family member has an issue from the past with the priest. the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife, or actually having an affair with her, culminating with him killing his buddy, then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn't slept with his wife after all. people are dying, others are coming under possession, and by this point most viewers don't even care anymore. except for their employee miguel, none of the characters in this movie was actually likable, making it hard to care, about any of them. the acting was terrible and the writing even worse. glad i saw it for free; although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost.

ok, i normally don't add comments on movies, but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh*t and riddled with incompetence that i just had to warn people about. blackwater valley exorcist is loosely about a wife-beating/pederast/priest and this podunk family of horse freaks, and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed. along with a heroic god shunning mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism, the wife-beating/ pederast/priest manage to save the day, but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him. all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless (i could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie)sh*t i've ever seen. any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn.

a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon. the local priest (who formerly dated isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter.this film is directed by ethan wiley, the writer of "house" and the writer/director of "house ii". i loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students. dawson leery could have done better. i have thought about blaming new writer ellary eddy, especially because the idea is hardly original (are they trying to cash in on the fans of "the exorcism of emily rose"?), but wiley should have been able to do his magic.also, you'd like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film. russo (playing the bishop) barely shows up, and combs has a great role as a sheriff... for the five minutes he's on screen (but i love the mustache). so, no help here.after seeing "the exorcist", all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default, no? and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least. no head-spinning or paranormal activity at all. just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup. all the "demonic" stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. as another reviewer wrote, "you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. yeah, it's chuck e. cheese gone wild." that sadly sums up the extent of the "evil" in this movie.if you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off-camera, this is the movie for you. but, if you don't mind my saying so, you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you're seeking.the plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who didn't, but did sleep with his daughter) and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife (who might have, but denies it). and then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in god. what was all the bible-quoting you were doing five minutes ago?a horrible exorcism movie. horribler examples of what combs and russo are capable of. and such a sad display of directing after the "house" series of films became classic. i would like to pretend wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal, uninspired film. the power of christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin.

this movie was probably one of the worst movies i've seen in a very long time. a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. ehh... where to start? the writing, the acting, the quality? all of it, sucked. quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies. blatant dialog, such as "how ya doing?"..."not that great, doc" (directly after an attempted exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide. of course he's not that great.) was, at some points, kind of funny. if not horribly written, planned out, and obvious. the general plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked, horrible. it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could. the only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film. oh yeah, and they never actually got the deed done.the acting? horrible. x100. i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel, del zamora. and his part was written horribly. the worst acting? arguably paul kappellas, whose acting combined with shitty music, a gun, and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through. he even screwed up his own death scene, one that should have been easy to nail. although, most everybody else's acting was horrible as well.the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie. there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died, that same amount of people became possessed at one point, and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand. like... 50 thumbs down.p.s. what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable, anyways?

i'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but i found it pretty comical. isobel is possessed by the devil. somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. there's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, valley of the dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel. it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode, but i actually paid to see this. instead of the cool head-twisting, sailor cursing, and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist; you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. yeah, it's chuck e. cheese gone wild. so, if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.

the movie started very well..so far isabelle's exorcism could be believed....but later, gosh!!! i didn't know if it was a horror movie, a drama one or a must not see one! the possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie....the make up!! well it looked pretty real at beginning, but at the end, last part of movie, the make up (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. if you want a good "exorcism" movie watch "the exorcism of emily rose".together with "hard candy" (totally boring, pathetic plot and ending), these two movies are the worst i've seen from lionsgate!! but well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films, but with this one, you will wish you never rent it!! exorcism movie fans, just stay with two "the exorcist" and "emily rose's exorcism"

i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and i don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd, but this looked so interesting and scary! i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me, possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about. just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.blackwater valley exorcism is about a girl, isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. but a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? i know... i know. then they go into several other stories with the priest and isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle? i'm not sure, then we get into a story with isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him.i mean, the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film, which i didn't like at all because i couldn't take it seriously. whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so i wouldn't really recommend this.2/10

documentaries about fans are always mishmashes, and never worth seeing through, but i found this one, made by some of the fans themselves, more than usually unenlightening. as a veteran of the original tolkien craze, forty years ago, i'd hoped for more than the obvious--which doesn't always equate to the true. if there's anyone living who doesn't already know the nature of a fandom, any fandom, from having been or known a fan, he won't discover it here. between irrelevancies, platitudes (to which the actors from the films are particularly prone), and acting out (by fans making the most--if not the best--of their one shot at fame), i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take. in addition, the film is rather lazy: it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort, e.g. what the exact legal loophole was (the wording of a copyright notice) that permitted the books' unauthorized publication in the u.s. (speaking of which: i take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as "irrelevant" and "psychedelic," which they were not. they were the work of jack gaughan, a very able sf illustrator of the period, and some fans, including me, found them more apt, and more attractive, than the covers on the rival set.)

dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets!!! also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. no one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. this should be a crime and.... i cant believe you would ruin a book like that. i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed!!!! it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it. your just making it a big joke.

this demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the eighth circle, tenth bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. sandow birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.stocking hell with republican political figures, fox news helicopters and christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. it is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite. nothing in birk's unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite his smug pretension to the contrary. i could have eaten a reel of video tape and puked a better movie. i regret the two hours of my life that i lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry. calliope will weep forever.

i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn't involved with this "movie". an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell. mao zedong and karl marx didn't make an appearance in hell, but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler? perhaps we'll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, fox news, even suvs. all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered - while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the "other side of the aisle" - to not have been a conscious effort. the singular exception i noticed, in the hour and a half, is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity: the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non-partisan.

a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on "dante's inferno," there is nothing especially clever. dante's "divine comedy" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art.i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked. be that as it may, few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire.the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of "schoolhouse rock" on the subject of lobbying and the "revolving door." it's really a shame that the entire film couldn't have been a musical. that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun.

kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. he may have made more classics than anyone else. he may have been a perfectionist. but man, was his first attempt ever bad!kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an ed wood film. it has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of "reefer madness" going insane for no reason.sure, you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there. it is a psychological/horror study of war. the characters became dehumanized and insane. there are people playing more than one role. there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. and there are a few interesting shots around there. but really, this is a mess.of course, i am not discouraging you from watching it. if you get a hold of it, you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it.

fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. he considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. this is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than "barry lyndon"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest, and has its genuine absorbing moments. it's a difficult film to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video. recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts.

stanley kubrick, a director who i hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces (clockwork orange, 2001, the killing, the shining, dr. strangelove, etc) took the film out of circulation, leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists. after seeing the film for myself, i could see why. at the age of 24, kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for look magazine, and had done a few short documentaries. like many first-time filmmakers that came in the decades after him, his ambition for fear and desire was, in short, to just go and make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if he could do it. on that level, he was successful. however, the film itself definitely is not.i can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something i did like about it throughout. even as the film's story went on the wayside, and the actors (whom kubrick didn't have any idea how to direct, not being a man of the theater), his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film. at times, there are some shots of close-ups and quick-shots in suspense/action scenes that are eye-catching. unfortunately, this is all the good i can really say of the film. although there are a couple of 'name' actors in the film (frank slivera, who also appeared in killer's kiss, and paul mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances overall are dull and very routine.in fact, that is the film's main demise for me; whenever i watch any kubrick film, even his early film noirs killer's kiss and the killing, i can tell who made it, as his style by then became distinct, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. it wasn't 'artsy' like i might have pictured (which is usually the case with first-time directors like scorsese and spielberg), but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn't kubrick, it felt like a lot of the time i was watching some b (or even c) grade movie by a director that time forgot- not quite 'ed wood' bad, but close. the music is as standard as can be, the fades are pedestrian, and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention.in short, as others have said and which i can agree, this is a "doodle pad" of a future ground-breaker, who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention (the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend except to those, like myself, who end up seeing everything by kubrick (or, perhaps, have to see every ultra-low budget war film ever made), if only out of curiosity.

this sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5-reeler is definitely not among harold lloyd's better films. gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. saccharine melodrama is abundant. the setup takes forever, as lloyd, the unconventional, but impossibly kindly, country doctor makes his rounds, bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly, and puppies. it's like a 1922 version of patch adams. ugh. 4/10.

it's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a tv show.doris day decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why. even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help. brian keith, barbara hershey, pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best, but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen.nothing much can be said in favor of it. skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films.

and obviously i didn't see it! but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead, i know now to avoid this like the plague! i hate it when hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?and i can't believe that someone like louis gossett, jr. would return for something like that.did jason gedrick really decline this? well, i hate to say it, but even if he took the role again, it would have still had that same continuity error. i bet (if he really turned it down), he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film.i'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel, but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd!

louis gossett jr returns to the well one more time as chappy sinclair who goes to doug masters (played by jason cadieux who is in for jason gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. it is horrendous to watch and gossett jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. and i saw cover-up, firewalker, aces:iron eagle iii, toy soldiers and jaws 3d. what is mysterious about louis gossett jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he's working. as i look at his post oscar win. some of his better movies include iron eagle, the punisher and the principal. considering that the latter two movies have him co-starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work. of course enemy mine and diggstown remain his best post-oscar win work.* out of 4-(bad)

whomever thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot. in this case once was enough. iron eagle was a good movie to watch. even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. iron eagle ii has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. i didn't even bother to watch iron eagle iii, but from looking at the r rating, i assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. well, iron eagle iv is probably the most inane sequel. lou gossett jr. returns as the always delightful "chappy" sinclair. another jason returns to fill the role of doug masters (canadian jason cadieux, who looks just like jason gedrick from the first iron eagle). but wait(here comes a possible spoiler).....wasn't doug killed in iron eagle ii? the writers must've been desprate for a story so they revived doug masters by saying he was a prisoner of the russians. this movie was the cheapest done of all the iron eagle films. why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies? (ex. police academy movies). i have always liked gossett jr.'s work in these films. he was the only one holding this turkey together. let's hope this was the last of the iron eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.

this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see.it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and (like an h.g. welles story i can't quite recall) may live to want back.keep in mind that this is a short (very short). it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring =bang= it's over. and, believe me, the 'punch line' is one you will remember.i'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase - or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy - of that i am sure.

are you kidding me? the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog. and the music was nothing great. anyone know what jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho....couldn't we have had a better line here? was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over-mixed way to loud music.

a family (a teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. however, their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father, who don't take kindly to newcomers on their patch. while having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister. with the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly, the lad decides to take matters into his own hands..veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made. at first, you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overwrought bad guys. but then, you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug's sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero. in fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be that they're pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can't defend themselves, is pretty despicable. but of course, there's the obligatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra-less under a very thin t-shirt. who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs. right?!the climax centres on the teenager, who up until now hasn't been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left, right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. it's completely implausible but hey, so is everything else in this film.. so at least you can't accuse it of not being consistent. so, rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist, check out the imdb pages for janet laine green, dehl berti, stephen hunter, jonathan crombie.. etc. notice a pattern emerging here? their careers all hit dead ends. why? sit through this, and all will become clear. remember kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you. please.. 3/10

olivia d'abo in a wet t-shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it. other than that, this canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of hillbillies is not worth anybody's time. the writing is bad, the acting is poor and the direction is sub-standard.

lonesome jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. both boys around 30, living at home, with absolutely nothing going for them. i live in the midwest and i can't name one family like this. i picked it up because i kind of like buscemi acting humor. now i realize i need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work. the acting and camera work and editing was fine. the first 15 minutes got you set, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story. the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off, but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the entire movie. the male family members, as expected, simply walked out after the first 30 minutes.

i was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. that is, a twenty-something guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. it just might have worked but there's a problem. and that problem's name is casey affleck. casey affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. his acting mantra must be "exert as little effort as possible at all times". or "why speak when you can mutter?" or maybe "put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls". lips moving when speaking? barely. facial expressions? none. muscles in face? atrophied. something? nothing. anything? zip.

the only time i seem to trawl through imdb comments is when i've seen a duff film. i guess i'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. for me, then, lonesome jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties. yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation, since after a while the gushing dies down and i'm relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own. i feel vindicated. it is a rubbish film, it doesn't hang together and it does constitute a wasted evening sitting through it. praise be to kindred spirits.

whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.if you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.if you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. you'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (i didn't, btw), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim's. then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself, and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized. you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention. you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish. the sad truth is, much as i wanted to like this movie... i hated it. it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason whatsoever, looked back at itself and then stopped.jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one that is conveyed on screen. jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. as others have said it's no hollywood tale, it's gritty and it's real. it's well made. life is quite a struggle at times. if anyone were to know "the answer", they do well to shout it from the rooftops.still, i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. you feel that it's going to say something, that if you just suffer through a little more of it, it'll have something to say. it'll make you stop and think. it doesn't.again, i do submit that this is a well crafted film. and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes. for the rest of us, it's utterly miss-able.

i like steve buscemi. i like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. you could say that i am -into- steve buscemi. a steve buscemi freak. i lurv steve buscemi.i remember when i first saw buscemi's full length directorial debut, "trees lounge." i enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. it was -almost- there. it -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see "small" movies about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" towns. it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie - one that with a few tweaks could have been great. but that's ok. i like the movie and i've watched it more than once.but this review is not about trees lounge. it's about "lonesome jim." when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who's movie it was, i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been. but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy, heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation.in other words, this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state - the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning, or if you happen to be the floozy, waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile. the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with store brand white bread, no less) and the emotion of a cadaver. i am not sure what the point of this film was, and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission. sorta like those new cars that don't come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (i'm not one of them, but hey, i can sympathize). overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film. i mean, trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. i blame a lot of this on affleck. why do people keep casting these affleck turds? they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with. one affleck was in one decent film (and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent) and all of the sudden every butthole named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can. and liv tyler is no better. being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. she is as lifeless as affleck. these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script. people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two duds together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart. i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum, but oh steve you let us down. this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper.

i am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. in fact, i just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. but no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. i'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i don't care to ever see or know.what accounts for my hostility to this movie? the characters are not believable. the plot is not believable. the pretentiousness of the movie is sickening. basically, every element of the movie rings false. buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well-worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life. however, buscemi was badly mistaken, because this movie contains nothing new. it tries very hard to be depressing, but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it, because it's obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world.what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards. disgusting!!!! bottom line: stay away from this worthless film at all costs.

i used to think that it couldn't get worse that "army of the dead" but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like "the godfather"!! the special effects are horrible (makes the original nintendo graphics look like hdtv). when it comes the acting, put it this way, i went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an oscar worthy performance, when compared to these d-list (and that's being kind about it) actors and actresses. so basically, if i had a gun to my head and head to chose between watching this movie again or chopping my own arm off with a dull knife, that's a tough choice!! you know what, who needs two arms anyways??

if you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (i guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash), you can't do better than this! the plot is inane, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see! 4 thumbs down! wooohoooooooo!!! seriously, i have no idea how the director and the "actors" can sleep at night! it's painful, and yet hysterically funny, to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something. if you can watch this crap without wincing, you're a better man than i'll ever be! i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself (and his money) into!

a great cast, a fantastic cgi monster and a brilliant script. if this film had had any of those things then it might not have been amongst the worst films i've ever wasted an hour and a half on. infinite chimpanzees with infinite typewriters have not yet written the complete works of shakespeare but along the way this has appeared in their waste-paper bin and somehow it got made into a movie. you can tell the the actors regret signing those contracts with every word they mutter directly into camera. the cgi is amateurish in the extreme and they might have created more tension of the cast had been attacked with the sinclair spectrum it was created on. i wanted to like this film, it has nice cameo appearances by gil gerard and walter koenig so i expected a fun horror movie that didn't take itself too seriously. it actually does try to take itself seriously but is about as much fun as trip to the dentist. do yourself a favour. don't watch this movie, you'll only encourage them to make more.

as other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie (keeping it kid friendly) fx was low class, they should of spent the $1 on a coke. as is typical with these d movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead. hope the money was worth it for boxleitner, really really big step down from babylon 5. nice to see what happened to buck rogers but damn this was low even for him. ' it was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also. don't watch.*****warning spoiler below****this thing chased down everyone it was after and yet boxlietner got away... that was pure bs. and the ending? how in the hell did the kids end up right there with him? that was just too much stupidity.

while trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient native american artifacts buried on the land, and unleashes the bone eater...a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that.indeed this movie had to be a sci-fi channel original. if it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. the effects in the film is laughable at best, and the bone eater monster is nothing but a cgi-animated being added into the frames at a later date. the actors don't even look all that frightened when they see the thing (probably because they really don't, and they're just terrible actors). it's a great comedy, though, even if it's supposed to be pure horror.

i agree with all the comments posted so far: this movie was a waste of time and energy, for viewers as well as those who made it. terrible cgi, awful script, stupid plot and hey, the setting is alabama but it looks like california. but the worst thing has got to be the native american angle on this, which pulls in every stereotype you can think of, from the chief surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, people speaking without using contractions ("do not do this thing!"), native american pipes playing in thin air, etc. it just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that i was tearing out my hair. a native american with any ounce of self-respect would have tossed their tv out the window at this trash. so in closing, i'd say this movie is pretty much an offense to everyone.

construction workers disrupt the native american burial ground of a large, hulking skeletal monster which disintegrates it's victims with it's touch, breath, or bone sword! the head honcho over the resort project, krantz(jim storm)orders his construction crew to keep their skeletal findings secret for much would halt the continuing development if the nearby katona tribe caught wind that remains were being dug up and disturbed. an aging bruce boxleitner, likable as always, stars as half-breed sheriff evans trying to keep peace between the katonas and krantz's crew. the peace was strained, at best, but with that skeletal monster running rampant making it's victims vanish without a trace, soon krantz wants answers to why members of his crew are missing..evans begins losing citizens as well. evans is warned by katona chief storm cloud(michael horse)that an ancient demon, the bone eater, has been loosened and can only be stopped with a sacred war axe(..the axe was removed by a worker who found it's remains with the weapon lunged inside)now in the back seat of his daughter kelly's(clara bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how daddy's girl has grown into quite a striking lady)boyfriend's truck. evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing will stop..and this must occur before the eclipse or it's power will become too strong for anyone to vanquish.a solid cast, floundering in an embarrassing horror outing. the cgi, isn't very good, although the monster could've been quite threatening if done with a better budget. it rides a horse made from dust chasing after it's prey, for petesake! some cameo appearances include buck rogers gil gerard as evan's deputy big jim, star trek's walter koenig as a coroner, & house's william katt, as a country doctor attending to the wounds of evan's deputy. none of these cameos last longer than one minute or so..sad, really. adoni maropis, impresses in an underwritten role as a brooding katona, johnny black hawk, who wishes to use the bone eater to drive the white man off his tribe's land. jennifer lee wiggins portrays kaya, a tasty dish of a katona female whose against black hawk's hatred for the white man and wishes for evans to follow his indian blood regarding putting an end to the bone eating monster. this might be worth sitting through if just to see boxleitner dressed in war paint and indian garb. i felt for the actor, to be honest, as bruce tries to keep a straight-face in such a terrible movie. in yet another over-worked and tiresome cliché, bruce's sheriff has an estranged relationship with his daughter, whose 17, hot, and wanting to date the "bad boy"..although this winds up being an underwritten sub-plot as is most of the plot concerning the killing skeleton and many of the poorly developed characters.

bad, bad, and did i mention bad? aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the movie was when surveyors are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left, but you can clearly see by their shadows, and the bright sky, that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. talk about consistency. read the script director!the only cool part of this movie, besides the rack on clara bryant of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton horse that the bone eater rides on. that thing was pretty cool as it chased the surveyors on their motorcycles.

i thought this movie was horrible. i was bored and had to use all the self control i have to not scream at the screen. mod squad was beyond cheesy, beyond cliche, and utterly predictable.

i really wanted to like this movie, but i just couldn't. it had the potential to be a really cool, hip remake of a cool show, but that's where it fell apart. it was too hip, too cool. first of all, all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers, which i'd seen lots of times. and the editing was very disjointed, so that the scenes didn't seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place. claire danes, who i love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles. the only bright spot was giovanni ribisi as pete. his slightly stupid, yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing. overall though, i'd recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more.

sometimes you get exactly what you expect. a film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit- and in this case it certainly doesn't. in fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself, which like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs, and over-the-top antics, but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun. utilizing a script by carl dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe, and wasting the talents of edward furlong, the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music, most notably the elaborate recreating of a 1978 kiss concert.

warning: this could spoil your movie. watch it, see if you agree. to think that we as humans can not learn from the past. the futuristic society portrayed glamorized what hitler believed, obliterate a race of people (in this case men) for the benefit of society. it made me sick to my stomach. also the plausibility of a y bomb is insane. even in war our instinct for self-preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity. we made mistakes in the past ie: japan, hiroshima and nagasaki in '45 but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in '63 during the cuban missile crisis

the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible. alas, with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films. with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. not here though. the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. oh, and the less said about the ending the better. happy film-viewing everyone !

this has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the sci-fi channel. here is how the movie starts, women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is a ok as long as it only targets soldiers (in case your wondering, men) however the virus back fires (big shock)and all the men on earth slowly die. then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man. now we are taken around 60 to 70 years from now, two female scientists are working on cloning a female baby and one of them says "hey, why don't we bring men back?" the other one says no the world is not ready for that, but promptly ignores her and thus a man walks the eath again.first off, this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty monsters. secondly, the writer forgot to mention that present day soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers so there is no real reason to have a virus like that. this is the biggest waist of time you can find. this movie managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story, but with the lifetime style acting. avoid this movie at all costs.i give this a 1 out of 10 but only because i could go no lower.

for three quarters of an hour, the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort. although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot, there is something happening. it is not much and it certainly is not obvious. the combination of palace impressions and story-driving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters. in fact, they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all. everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own cliché and role - the cute, kinda headstrong girl; the fighting überwoman, the snobby aristocrat. the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all, he is a shallow presence, which, actually, doesn't even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to - it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up. when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening, the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous. it solves - or better, dissolves - itself with a by-the-book deus ex machina, more clichés and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen. it's history, alright. first the movie's a drama though it's supposed to be comedic, and then it turns into a farce. the protagonists do what they are expected to do, and there are no surprises. the first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored. maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audience.this movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning (since there is none) nor for its technical realization. the animation and editing is fair and so's the sound mixing; but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late 1980's. in fact, the visual treats seem static, un-inspired and un-original.worst of all - it totally fails to entertain, even if you don't bother with characters and all that stuff. there's too little going on here, and the rest is corny at best. get a real ghibli instead, have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one.

maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with aids. but really people, the maniacal laughter & mayhem during the withdrawal scene? did you not see that coming? i'm surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. the acting was fine, sure. but to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language. things happen, but that's it. there's no glue or motive that can be detected on screen, allowing the subject matter to use pre-existing emotional connections to furthur the plot, without the script doing it like it's supposed to.

i would give this a zero if they had that rating. fun was no fun at all. i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. the others i watched this movie with also agreed. the acting was annoying. i am tired of jim carey's over the top ham acting. the supporting cast was no better. while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way. i actually disliked the leading characters (dick and jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot. a worthless movie and a total waste of time.

this movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i've seen in a long, long while. to be fair, i was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but i was anticipating to at least be entertained. with such low expectations, how could i manage to be disappointed? jim carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. he seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his fletcher reede from liar liar. this new character, dick harper (a.k.a. fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp. if you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character, it is most likely because carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. carrey's outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward--and, ultimately, sad.tea leoni as jane does little more than provide the abbott to carrey's costello. i typically find tea leoni refreshing and underused, but not in this case. jane harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty-five, and it is in that non-specificity that the character of jane becomes uninteresting to watch. she simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie's general theme, which seems to be that... wait, no, this movie has no theme. unless you count "big business is evil" as a theme. i thought that was more of a given.richard jenkins and alec baldwin both deliver believable (though tired) supporting performances, but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing. it's very clear that alec baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister c.e.o. as he puts into eating a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot of lately).slight tangent, but has alec baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit? anyway, take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. this is the one to catch on hbo in a few months. dick and jane are present, but there's no fun to be had.

unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that jim carrey (producing and starring) and brian grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. basically dick harper (carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. that's until the company of dynocorpe sinks and closes down. now dick and his wife jane (téa leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. no matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want. so they start robbing a few places. and then they decide to rob the guy that set dick up, his ex-boss jack mcallister (alec baldwin). i think the most laughable bits are when carrey's in the elevator singing "i believe i can fly" and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery, and is speaking with a voice changer (he sounds like a crap robot). okay!

as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism. after all, fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success. after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. the idea that a charming, charismatic, top v.i.p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible. the actors seem confused with the situation as well. of course, the stereotypical, rich, uncaring head of the operation doesn't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder. one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro, obsessed with possessions, the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together, and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able, quite happily, to put a gun to another man's head. jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going. the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work. the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever. carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality. carey shines when he is presented with a strong, daring character (man on the moon, the truman show, ace ventura) which this film never presented him with, despite its best efforts.

part of the movie's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. while this is good for drama, in comedy, we know the pains it need not be emphasized. as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane. it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name, but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line.however, if the movie was retitled to be "the art of the steal" and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal (stupidly of course) would have given the movie a major boost. while, at the same time the movie should show the ceo at least in the beginning to be a crook, so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that. the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind, a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly. a scheming husband character who is that of a wile e. coyote on the road runner would be more funny, including the slapstick comedy. but in this case, a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here. i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie. but since the viewpoint was done wrongly, the robbery part had to be limited.you will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes (during jim carrey's great rise), but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy, that is the part that needs a major overhaul. it can be funnier, if problems were faced more like john travolta's civil action during the downfall. that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.

i thought the movie was sub-par. the acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. the director dropped the ball on this movie. it was not james (jim) or tea. imho it was the music that killed it. there is a scene where things go down hill and jonny cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. after that the movie could not recover. the deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - i even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene. the music kept me from being pulled in to the movie.i say it had potential but was poorly done, i would even say rushed into final production. kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. the theater release was good, i though so after watching it, but the movie release exorcist:dominion was a helluva lot better. same story just different director. same should be done here.

what a terrible misfire. not only the title but the idea is the same as that jane fonda, george segal vehicle of a few decades ago. why? i wonder, someone with the clout of jim carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. he could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. money, money, grosses, christmas. but i'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. i call it uncomfortable because that's how i felt. aware as i was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny. and failing, miserably. it could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the post enron days but no, that would be pointing too high, too risky. what a shame!

a satire about greed and money, what? there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. jim carrey's reign was certainly short lived. he is an unbearable presence on the screen. the insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. he produced this, this "masterpiece" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. "the number one comedy in america" shout the desperate tv adds. of course, jim carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over. if i sound angry is because i am. i spent a sunny afternoon in california, plus, between tickets, parking, flat cokes etc, almost 45 bucks on this thing, starring and produced by mr carry. not anymore, do you hear? not anymore.

oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. it not only is frantically unfunny, but worse, a very good original was trashed in the bargain. jane fonda, believe it or not, actually turned in the performance of her life in that one. even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life. maybe she is just flat good as a crook. any other time, wow, what a waste of time. but she and segal team up beautifully, so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby, catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.because very very very little of that one remains, to this ones horror. nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss..... and uhh........oh my lord, that's it? well, looks like it. it truly is that bad a film.

jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he's a great actor (eternal sunshine, for example).however, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has nothing else to recommend it.even if you do like carrey's comedy, i am not sure you will find this film amusing. i went to see it on a saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. they giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. i think it raised about five genuine laughs.the problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. it can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (i'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.the strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. but these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), i would have done the same. and in my entire 25 years of movie going, i have done that just once before.

see dick work.see jane work.dick and jane are married.they are successful.they have a son. they have a nice house.they have a latino housekeeper.the housekeeper teaches spanish to the son.the son speaks spanish.ha-ha.see dick get promoted.the pompous ceo is a crook.see dick take the fall for the pompous ceo.jane quits her job.oops.see dick and jane out of work.dick & jane turn to crime.as a plot device, they decide to rob the ceo.see the robbery get botched.see dick & jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the robbery.yay. see the end credits.okay, so you've got the plot. beyond that, dick and jane careens from one scene to the next. one barely connecting with the last one or the next one. the whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. jim carrey didn't bother to bring his "a" material, he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing. but heck, when you're getting paid $20 million plus, why bother. tea leoni is frantic. i guess i would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop.there's just something sort of off about dick & jane. carrey and leoni aren't funny and have little chemistry. the script isn't funny. and it's not well-plotted.but it may be bigger than that. the reality of dick and jane is, perhaps, a little too real. maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an enron-like situation, when real-life still lacks a happy ending.

dick and jane harper (jim carrey, téa leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.i've always been a fan of jim carrey. it's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. the last one was bruce almighty which was pretty good. he has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. fun with dick and jane proves that he still has it. even though the film was funny, it was still kind of disappointing. it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be. it's worth watching once though unlike most of carrey's movies, it doesn't have a good repeat value. part of the problem is the script. i was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made the forty year old virgin. some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard. if jim carrey wasn't in it, than the film would have been a lot worse.next to jim carrey is téa leoni. she's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny. she doesn't match up well with carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance. they should have gone with someone else. the supporting cast includes alec baldwin, richard jenkins and aaron michael jenkins. the latter plays billy harper and he actually gives a decent performance. he wasn't as annoying as most child stars are. alec baldwin was okay and richard jenkins tried too hard to be funny. to be honest, i'm a little bias here. the film altogether was pretty average but i liked it more because of jim carrey's performance. fans of jim carrey should enjoy it but that's about it. in the end, fun with dick and jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable. rating 6/10

there is no "fun" poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants! or the desperate plight of head-shop owners, for that matter! that the richer-than-god brian glazer didn't see the irony of having the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does - rob honest, hardworking people of their life savings - doesn't surprise me! hell, how do you think he got to be richer than god?!in this alleged satire about greed, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the mcmansions, the mctoys, the mcchildren, the mcillegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the mcmansions, the mctoys, and the mcchildren! but the main problem (aside from the revolting bigotry) is the premise: as the former executive of a now-infamous company, dick would be the big scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! no soup kitchens for him! and, raking in high six-figures, you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a gore/lieberman poster!

i rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is booooooorrrring. despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). wondering if the fast forward function on your vcr works? rent this film and put your concerns to the test.

a killer (john karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. detective decarlo (james luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). tracking the killer to his home, decarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.inspired by the crimes of ted bundy before he was caught, killer's delight is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick. director jeremy hoenack has no idea how to pace a film or even make it suspenseful. he does know how to show lots of close ups of the killer wringing his hands though! the only thing this really has going for it is the captured 70s atmosphere (look out for the bathroom wallpaper). well, that and a downbeat ending. the media blasters/shriek show dvd has lots of nice stuff though including an audio commentary by hoenack and karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternate opening.

detective sergent vince de carlo (james luisi) and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer/rapist. can psychologist carol (susan sullivan) help, or will she become the killer's next victim? and what is with the killer's hilarious white dude afro? inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy, "killer's delight" aka "the dark ride" is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much. if anything, it's more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie, as much of the violence occurs off camera. sure, we get mutilated bodies, but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department-especially considering that they are from the aftermath, and not during the crime. those hoping for the likes of "the toolbox murders" or "maniac" will be very disappointed.fortunately, there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get's the tone right, and is quite suspenseful to boot. also, john karlen is quite effective as the killer, though his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle) is more than a bit distracting."the dark ride" is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation, as it lacks the proper exploitation elements, and is dated even by the standards of the time. those looking for a better example should probably turn to "don't go in the house" and a few others instead, as this just doesn't cut it.

i can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the imdb website! have i been issued with the special edition naff version? edited by dewhurst, produced by bernard matthews, this film should be housed in battersea. i'm sorry for all the uk-centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying). the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted. what on earth is irons doing in this film?

jeremy irons and forrest whitaker are good actors. but this movie was badly written. first of all, during the hijack scene, irons sits too comfortably in his chair...he appears to be reading something, and rather calmly too! perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes? also, the violence at the hijacking was a big letdown. slow-mo, bullets flying--how his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost. his grieving afterward wasted another 10 minutes. then he decided to "get revenge" and talk to all his industry journalist friends and ambassadors (he's a journalist for the stuffy economist rag) and lo and behold, they actually give him tips on where to find the bad guys! how do they know? but what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when irons finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging out--but not the baddies who killed his wife--and blows them away anyway. so he's just a murderer. he gets away and, well...i shut it off. i mean i couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything, and also i thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers. instead he's going after their friends, i guess, or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons laying around. the suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame ("it's ok son, crying helps," he says to his son. son says "no it doesn't" and father says "you're right..it doesn't.")irons takes on questionable roles--like that one dragon movie he did. he was excellent in brideshead revisited, which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller.

i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. for example, the names of some serbian terrorists (that i remember) are caradan maldic, ivanic loyvek and leo hasse. what kind of names are that? certainly not serbian! by the way, caradan maldic!!! what a name, i laughed for days thinking about it. probably an implication on karadzic and mladic. secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians. a journalist like the main character ought to have known that. thirdly, the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo-croatian. all this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. at times it makes no sense whatsoever!!!

all through his career hitchcock did great films; this was not one of them.a man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama.anyone who has seen 1930s fritz lang films- 'm' comes to mind- will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time. there is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace, darkness, and depravity that hitchcock might have been seeking to instil.what it is worth watching out for, however, is the sequence associated with the shooting at the albert hall. once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion. the camerawork is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly. here you can see the future master: hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect: when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it.

i'll have to admit that i'm at a disadvantage here; when i learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself, then that's a problem. although the plot of "the man who knew too much" seems generally straightforward, the movie allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery. by the time we get to the scene where a witchy looking woman establishes the secrecy of "the first degree of the seven fold ray", i didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if i missed something.in retrospect, the cryptic note retrieved by mr. lawrence (leslie banks) from the handle of a shaving brush was a craftily written message, leading to a dentist named barbor, and eventually to the albert hall, a place, not a person as indicated by "a. hall". but for all the intrigue, it's never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated. okay, so louis bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named ropa, but why was ropa a target? come to think of it, why was the note even written and secured in the shaving brush? did bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen?with it's disjointed scenes, "the man who knew too much" is hard to follow and a bit disorienting, however i'll give alfred hitchcock credit for this early effort. for perspective, i'll have to watch some of his other work of the same era, though this movie certainly can't hold a candle to his later works like "psycho" or "north by northwest".

racing enthusiast fabian (as tommy callahan) smokes, drinks, and suffers blackouts while juggling feelings for alluring brunette annette funicello (as francie madsen) and blonde mainstay diane mcbain (as annie blaine). complicating matters are ms. funicello's boozy race car boyfriend warren berlinger (as eddie sands), and her father jan murray (as pete madsen), who encourages the reckless drivers. funicello's cow-eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable; however, her drunken driving scene is unnerving. "thunder alley" provides marginally more nascar excitement than its predecessor, "fireball 500" (1966) *; be warned, it isn't much. a wild party scene, featuring some mild strip tease, is the film's low highlight.

thunder alley finds fabian banned from nascar tracks after causing the death of another driver. stanley adams might want to put him on his team of racers, but the other drivers aren't for having him around.desperate for employment fabian hooks up with an auto stunt show owner jan murray who's paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on fabian's bad rep. he's got to take it, but annette funicello who's murray's daughter provides another reason to stick around.the rest of the film is fabian's struggle to get back to the nascar circuit while at the same time juggling both annette and his current girl friend diane mcbain. personally, i would have taken mcbain, she has it all over annette.thunder alley is helped by location shooting at the southern nascar tracks and good film footage of nascar racing. not helped by a rather silly story which delves into the real reason for fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from same.still fans of nascar might go for this.

ladies and gentlemen.. be sad (or be glad !).. we are in the disgusting forensic t.v series-era !! now count with me and anathematize our luck :"csi: crime scene investigation", "csi: miami", "csi: ny", "ncis", "crossing jordan", "da vinci's inquest", even "the cosby mysteries" !..didn't we already have enough ?!from the late 1990 till the late 2000s we've got almost the same sick series about the genius criminologist with a partner (or a team) who go to solve crimes by scrutiny the autopsy ..and what a nauseating mission to do. so you will have for sure lots and lots of repellent scenes where we see clearly, accurately and awfully the most horrific shots in the history of t.v.oh god.. once we had the great days; the good cop (or detective)era such as columbo, kojak, magnum, and simon & simon. or the good old sci-fi era, like the six million dollar man, the bionic woman, knight rider. and oh boy we've got also the hot & sexy such :cover up, the love boat, baywatch, even a flop as thunder in paradise.all of those were unforgettable, original, had good..real good thoughts, action, women ..till the x files came.. and then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact : the catastrophe!x files undoubtedly was one of the greatest, but there was a few slight disadvantages, we had have agent dana scully (medical doctor and fbi agent) at every episode doing an autopsy ..,and of course her lap (as the series succeed) became part of our living room, so the thirsty-for-money producers loved it with all the physical terror + the exciting hunt for the truth.. therefore they tried to repeat it in another not too far classification : the forensic !but it became so ugly, full of deformation, and very cruddy just like bones. plus the unsexy present of emily deschanel, and bleeder as david boreanaz (he was much better in angel), and all of these corpses .. to the extent that every time i've watched it i found my self screaming aaaahhhhhh !! what a terrible gross !!..cancel it please.. you've canceled before real good shows such as (the lone gunmen) or (a man called hawk). here it's a bad one.. so please.. little mercy and enough with the bones-era !!!.. or we'll drop dead ourselves of nausea and monotony !!

i am a regular reader of kathy reichs' temperance brennan novels. as such i am extremely surprised she even consulted on this show.it is horrible by comparison to the books. the temperance brennan character is, in the books, a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter. in 'bones', she is an arrogant (rhymes with rich), who, in typical p c fashion, is not a mother. the emphasis on her assisting staff, complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits, is totally in contrast with the books.in total deference to the p c movement, she portrays the enemies of the u s as peace lovers (!). some of the information isn't even correct, for example, having a character from afghanistan as an active member of an arab-american friendship group. since when is an afghan an arab?! i'm sure if negative references were made to 'disadvantaged minorities', or women, or glbt's, the show's producers/writers/directors would have to issue an apology. however, in typical far left fashion, all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority group--asians, as david boreanaz' agent booth continually refers to angela montenegro as a 'squint'.forget that stuff, and forget this show. after 'the man in the suv' episode, i thought i'd try a second episode to see if it got any better. it only got worse! i don't even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide, and i won't be watching the show ever again.

dude...i liked buffy and angel as much as the next sci-fi freak...but this is too much. the worst lead actress ever!! not even david "hot pants" boreanaz is able to save this crap. no wonder i never watch fox  it blows!! we totally gave it a chance, and it continued to suck. we watched four or five painful, agonizing episodes. i want to kill the execs at the network so bad! why is money being spent on this drivel?!?! i don't get it and i don't support it and you should never waste your time watching this show...unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their sockets! crap. crap. crap.

this is so bad i don't know where to begin.the lead role is a good starting point. it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book, who was (a bit) more credible. no, this one is invincible, infallible, indomitable, and insipid even beyond the overinflated standards that this "chicks with swords" era that our medias are spinning out of late. she is a twenty-something top-model, thin as a match yet rich, already a leader in her academic field, a kung-fu master, a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny fbi agents. she is god.to balance it out, she is supposed to be socially awkward (due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a "spock") which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is "star wars", or "american idol", but yet when it's really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat, because she is so superior, ya know. to top it out, she is played by a wooden actress.the more talented boreanaz serves as a faire-valoir token for this construct, acting as a bumbling comic-relief and house "watson". in fact, everything in there is a pop-parody of better works like sherlock holmes, csi and x-files, from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists. it is however cheaper, as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs, but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it, hence the crazy rating this turkey gets.in fact, the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy, resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy, while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo-conservative view on things.story-wise, there's not much here to feast upon, as crimes (that always start out with some gruesome remains) are resolved using non-existent technology while the "squints", lovable but so wrong (the women less than the guys) goes on varied theories, all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start, and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy, typically a real tough hombre, with a spin kick here and a slapper there. the end.

the first season of bones is playing in finland and i can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy.it's a poor mans' csi. or actually, csi without coherent plot. although bones has potential, it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. it's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought. from the start you get the feeling how awkward the acting is.long story short - don't waste your time on bones.

i just finished watching one episode(s1-#5 a boy in a bush), so maybe my review is not very fair.but based on that episode, this is a very poor version of csi, the acting is crap. the main character, dr whatever her name is, is so fake it actually hurts. i wouldn't cast her to do an add for dog food!the other hurtful thing is david boreanaz of the "angel" fame, a good actor, does a great job, but wasted coz of the idiotic acting of that woman.supporting cast is ok, but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of emily deschanel .very disappointing version of csi, very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it.that woman is really sh#t, at least in that episode. but based on this one view, i will not even invest watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen.

another son of sam is definitely not an oscar winner. technically, it's horrible. the acting is not too good either. but there is something about it that makes you want to watch more (sort of like a car wreck). the ridiculous close-ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything. if you are looking for a scare...this ain't the flick for you. it's very obscure and nearly impossible to find. i'm sure there's a reason for that. for a while, it was titled hostage. it don't matter what you call it, it's still a poor choice for entertainment. it might be good for a mst3000 party or something. can you believe they would use such a title as another son of sam? if that don't have exploitation written all over it, i'll eat my hat. i remember when this was shot in belmont, nc. a lot of local personalities were used as talent.

as embarrassing as it is to admit, i was listed as production manager on this film... my very first! as a matter of fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. watch carefully, and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes, as a soon-to-be-murdered asylum attendant named... "cely" (my own last name).originally titled "hostages" this picture was changed to "another son of sam" by the producer-director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time. nothing could have helped. i don't even think this picture was good enough to be shown on "mst 3k!"the film was shot primarily with a collection of old mitchell cameras and early arriflex hand held cameras. matter of fact, the shot of the helicopter during the hostage siege was filmed with my own wwii era arri. the picture was filmed entirely in charlotte and belmont, north carolina in the mid seventies. most of the "stars" were local tv newscasters, and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or gullible enough to believe former stuntman and producer-director, dave a, adams' delusions of adequacy.if you enjoy watching this kind of picture, you might love the work of another north carolinian, the legendary earl owensby.

i'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. don't get me wrong, it's not that i don't like 'these kind of movies'.while i very well can enjoy a good mindless hollywood action blockbuster like die hard 4.0, i like the 'dogma' kind of movies, or 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, if they are well made.a good example is festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy locations. just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie.is nine lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy locations? yes. is it a good movie? i'm glad you asked. the answer is: absolutely not.first of all, everyone is raving about the acting performances. i'm terribly sorry, but you can act all you want, but if the story and the dialogue is not believable, the acting falls on its behind immediately. and that is exactly the case with nine lives.not once did i have the feeling while watching 'nine lives' that i was watching real people having a real conversation. i had the feeling i was watching actors trying to come across as 'real characters' while they were were saying things a 'real person' would never say under the circumstances.you can hardly call it a spoiler, but there are some dialogue excerpts below. if you think that reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience stop reading here. if you want a good laugh, continue reading.the dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragical. you want examples? plenty of those in 'nine lives'.example1:picture this. couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion. woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband:woman: i could get used to this (meaning the expensive house). man: don't. woman: why not? it could be. man: no. they are who they are and we are who we are. woman: i like the sound of that -- we are who we are.she likes the sound of that? her man is acting like a jerk, but she likes the sound of that. then an elderly couple walks past them holding hands. this is what the woman comes up with:woman: look! they are like children after school. they lived through so much. shared everything. i love you.they are like children after school? and then the most overused cliché lines you ever heard? finishing with 'i love you'? she says this while her man is being a jerk to her? yes, very logical, very realistic, not. if anything, this kind of dialogue made me wanna strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible, horrible things.example 2:elderly mom, dad and younger daughter at a funeral. dad: i didn't realize andrew was religious. mom: it's for comfort. daughter: it's for strength. mom: life is fleeting. dad and daughter burst out laughing. yeah, this one-liner cracks me up any time, especially at a funeral! sorry, i must have missed the joke here.and it goes on and on and on....how about the camera work? don't even go there. 'boring' would be a compliment. it supposed to come across as 'realistic'; instead, you miss half of the actors facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in this movie), while half the time the camera is aimed at someone's back or side instead of the face.conclusion? well, don't say i didn't warn you! it's a good movie to rent if you want to make out with your date or something during the movie, because you won't even care whether the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes.overrated and more boring than watching grass grow kinda sums it up.

the key scene in rodrigo garcia's "nine lives" comes when sissy spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn, find a nature documentary on television, at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene, predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories, but none of them ever seem to really connect. a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts, with his current wife, a dinner party for an unhappy couple. garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before.garcia's first film, the wonderful, overlooked "things you can tell just by looking at her," also had a short-story structure and overlapping characters, but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow. the gimmicky premise of "nine lives," that each of its nine stories is told in a single, unbroken take in real time, never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum. it's also a fairly visually ugly movie. interior shots are often murky and hard to watch, while other scenes--particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents--are rendered annoying by the camera-work. given that this is garcia's third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television, the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish. like fellow filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer rebecca miller, garcia (son of gabriel garcia marquez) is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the film-making ones.individual scenes are touching and even affecting. i did like jason issacs kissing robin wright penn's pregnant belly. and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre-surgery sedation. and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter. but the film (unlike "things you can tell just by looking at her") feels more like an exercise than actual drama. we are just watching people act.

"quit while your ahead" is a phrase they never learn. typical hollywood sequel scenario: if the first film was only shocking, the second wasn't, expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year. even worse are the prequels, events of which were already explained in detail. if you haven't seen to first two films you will not like this one. it's like starting to watch lord of the rings or star wars with the last trilogy movie. so "stand alone" this film is not.remember in the first movie about lucians revenge? remember the second about the long lost savage brother? well if you saw those two 5 min moments and paste them together you would get a 5 min prequel. but the creators ether thought these 5 min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors, cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process. "i have a loot of money, i make movies for a living and i'm bored. what will i do? i know! i'll make a movie." so anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 min  that's this movie. and you know what will happen to the main "immortal" characters, so there is little suspense. by the way, all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min. the only thing that made my eyebrow rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie. sick. the rest was braveheart remix. if you want a comedy, see braveheart first then this movie.now i'm going to rant a bit  the movie put me in the mood. who invented the concept of "vampire vs. werewolf" in the first place? it's older than i am and got old just as fast. and why do vampires look like goth girls in heat, while werewolves look like psycho bears? hiding bad films behind cleavage fails. isn't it about time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright posture? how can their unchangeable werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into shreds? and why with all their powers the vampires didn't rule the world? blaa, blaa, blaa what a waste.

to put it simply, this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. after a while, i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed-up anal retentive.and, this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out, blue-steel-greyishness. hmmm, the last time i checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors. in fact, the light they put out tends to be more in the warmish, yellowish-orange range of the spectrum. so where's all the blue-steel-grey light coming from?this movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx, but it's still dreck. it's pathetic junk put out for today's movie-goers who are easily placated by pathetic junk.i very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices, but this was a total hack job.universal studios' 1941 "the wolfman" is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays.i'm done with this franchise. the first movie was reasonably decent. the second still somewhat entertaining. but this one i couldn't even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring.

cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. i watched this one first uncut and un-mst3k'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments.the plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the ai robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. the few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the dark one, which seems to be part computer and part organic being. the 'air slaves' work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air. every once in a while, the dark one has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death, so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the dark one.okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. on to the silly stuff, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing that everyone sports, including car seat cover 'fur' garments, loin cloths, and spangly stuff and feather boas(worn mostly by the dark one's henchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent). or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so-called 'actors', who's dialog is high on pretension and low on sense. or the dime store special fx, including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for 'deadly' sewer snakes, a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can, and terrible 'mutants' with halloween rubber masks on.a band of air slaves follow their leader, a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside, to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark one. the guy's name is neo, which explains where the wachowski brothers got the idea for the matrix. they meet up with a group of amazons along the way, with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bested(of course). has anyone else ever noticed that in every amazon movie or t.v. show ever produced, these so-called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men or women? amazons are just pansies, i guess.this band of determined warriors makes their way through central park...errr...the ravaged lands beyond the last standing city(good way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed new york city, anyway) and journey into the sewers leading to the power station where the dark one and his go-go girl henchwoman valeria hang out. here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms, a giant spider no one sees, and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the dark one's personal guard. the final showdown is pretty sad. one of the slaves, a girl who's father was taken by the dark one because he'd produced a way for people to breathe the foul air, sees that her father has been 'consumed by the dark one's true form", which involves him being eaten by a giant avocado until only his head is sticking out. the three remaining adventurers destroy the dark one by turning off a few switches, and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper. the two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines, and that's it. the end.

i was so "impressed" with tim kincaid's mutant hunt that i gave this one a try. it is the near future, post apocalypse of course. a wandering fighter named neo (no, not that neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge the dark one and his underling valaria. along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. oh my! sadly, robot holocaust is hardly up (or down) to hunt's level. clocking in at a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is one cheap flick. the sets have all the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like john travolta in the final dance number of staying alive. the atomic wasteland is a combination of rubble filled old buildings and central park. the dark one's headquarters is ominously named the power station and looks like, well, a power station. the acting is universally bad except for angelika jager as the evil valaria. jager is a whole 'nother level of bad. vit er sick cherman acczent, she gives a performance so amazingly bad that it becomes the sole reason to recommend this film. she also delivers the film's only nudity in the "pleasure chamber" section of the film. ed french again supplies the robot effects but they aren't nearly as slimy as his work in mutant hunt.

i kind of like jag. it do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. for an outsider (a non american) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.i don´t like that rabb and mackenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the tv show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army.i still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. but i would prefer more episodes when rabb and mackenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.

28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of chile, south america and the whole world. this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. true, he was democratically elected, but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis. he was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. we'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. the authors of the movie take a completely pro-allende position, there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him, or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro. the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.

laughable would be a good term to describe this movie. but, since this movie deserves nothing good said of it, i'll use the term god-awful instead.centering around the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the nefarious doings of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent. michael pare (a real actor! but only in the sense that pinocchio was a real boy...) leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chase-and-gobble-hapless-victim scenes. there is some vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting does.as if this doesn't insult the viewer enough, the movie also features what i'll call "guns of never-ending ammunition". i never saw mickey parrot or his female side-kick change clips once during the entire film, yet i can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon. forty rounds may not seem like that many, but we are talking standard handguns here. i figure 15 round clip, tops. and remember, they never change clips, nor even appear to carry any extra ammo.it's dumb-assery like this which consigns movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so. the third-rate cgi does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at, else you'll start crying. why scifi channel repeatedly churns out this mush is anyone's guess.my advice....give this one a wide berth...a very wide berth!

i just found out before writing this review that "komodo vs. cobra" and another movie called "curse of the komodo" were both directed by the same guy, jim wynorski. that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. they both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. what differences are there? well, the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and there's a giant cobra on the island as well, hence the title "komodo vs. cobra" even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the 'story.' "komodo vs. cobra" is more or less what you'd expect given its title and its channel origin: the sci-fi channel. although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you (i liked a movie called "komodo") i hardly doubt this one will."komodo vs. cobra" is not only a boring film, but it's also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi flicks i've seen in a long time. in some of these movies, there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort, but i see very little here. that's indicated again by it just being a rehash of "curse of the komodo." the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a second-rate video game, the cinematography and misc en scene is poor, the acting ranges from passable to poor, the action scenes are dull, and then there are some parts that are, frankly put, unforgivably bad. i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and i can deal with this. but in this movie, where michael paré takes a single thirty-eight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading oncewell, at first i laughed, but even then it just became tiring. that would be the 'action.' a monster appears, people scream, paré fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture, and somebody gets eaten."komodo vs. cobra" is a very bad movie. the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named michelle borth, who is not only very beautiful, but a surprisingly strong performer. even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given, michelle borth managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as junky as this. she obviously took it for the paycheck, but it won't boost her career any, i'm afraid.

writer & director jay andrews, a.k.a. jim wynorski, serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade-z computer generated reptiles in "komodo vs. cobra," as generic a rip-off of "mysterious island" meets "jurassic park" as you can imagine. the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects. the cobra and the komodo are hilariously awful. however, the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable. clearly, "komodo vs. cobra" had a budget that so low that virtually everything non-human in its looks as fake as all get out. this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the u.s. military conducts top-secret dna testing on animals. the result is that gigantic komodos and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise. as the action opens, the primary scientist is gobbled up by a cobra that likes to swim. after, we are introduced to a group of 'greenpeace' like environmental protesters and a journalist. planet one organizer jerry ryan (ryan mctavish of "hellbent") pays charter boat skipper jim stoddard (michael pare of cbs-tv's "houston knights") five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island. meanwhile, the u.s. military suspect that something is amiss on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the supersized predators. our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island, dr. susan richardson (michelle borth of "wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project, who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction. the title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes, who have been consistently whittled down by the monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island. there's no tension, suspense, or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature. the best thing about this yawner is composer chuck cirino's orchestral soundtrack; it gives "komodo vs. cobra" an epic feel. usually, jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel, but this ranks far below his low standards. the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys. in one scene, our heroic group fords a river and we don't get to see any wet t-shirts. drat! there's nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck. i think that the military guys do far too much saluting when they get their heads together to conspire. let's hope that michael pare got a good payday out of this garbage. the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought. it's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.

where do i start? first off, the story sucks. the acting sucks, the effects really suck, i guess i'll start with the story. the story for komodo vs. cobra: number one, it doesn't explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there. or for that matter, how it was created. the acting: terrible! it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street (which is probably what he did). and last and definitely the least, the effects: they are so horrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur, that looks incredibly unrealistic. the water doesn't even move when the cobra appears. all in all: terrible piece of crap, don't even think about renting it.

komodo vs. cobra starts as 'one planet' environmentalist jerry ryan (ryan mctavish) & his girlfriend carrie (renee talbert) hire captain michael stoddard (executive producer michael paré) to take them to an island in the south pacific, at first stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes his mind when a load of cash is offered. along with tv news reporter sandra crescent (jeri manthey) they set sail for the island & once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal dna genetic experiments which have resulted in huge komodo dragon's & king cobra's that have eaten almost every other living thing there & stoddard & co are next on the menu...co-written & directed by the ever awful jim wynorski under his jay andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful, this is just plain hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual rubbish 'creature features' the sci-fi channel have the nerve to air if that's possible. the script is terrible, predictable & utterly boring, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with dna, a group of people are trapped with said monsters & have to try to escape being eaten. that's it, that's the whole plot of komodo vs. cobra, maybe this was trying to rip-off avp: alien vs. predator (2004) with the title but all the 'vs.' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beasts at the very end, boring as hell & surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash. the character's are poor, the dialogue is awful, the pace is slow, the story is predictable & cliché ridden & the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both komodo dragon's & cobra's are amphibious which they are not. hell, komodo vs. cobra isn't even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it's so dull & hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons.how does wynorski keep getting directing jobs? he is probably consistently the worst director currently working, how can he keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts & still churn out such an awful film? i think this was cut to get a pg or for it's tv showing since every time someone swears it's masked by a parrot squeak! there's zero gore or violence & the monster scenes are limp, people just sort of stand there, the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing or roaring & that's about it. the cgi computer effects are terrible, this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible.with a supposed budget of about $450,000 this looks as cheap as it was, the hawaiian locations are nice to look at but that's about it. the acting is poor from an uninterested looking cast.komodo vs. cobra is an absolutely terrible sci-fi channel 'creature feature' from jim wynorski, films don't get much worse than this.

if you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting, cheesy "special" effects, and typical sci-fi plot...then this is the movie for you! not at the acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually fairly decent. the special effects weren't the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. there was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie. overall, a good movie if you're looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun of. not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious.

this movie is hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another? giant cgi versions of these beasts which battle! however i do require one of the guns used in the movie. because apparently they are using cheats. count the amount of shots they use before having to...oh wait that's right they never have to reload. regardless count the shots... it's hilarious.the sound effects used in the movie for the komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant. oh and did i forget to mention that apparently these giant komodo dragons are stealthy as hell? because somehow even when the actors are looking in the direction that the beast comes from they are surprised when it appears.whenever someone dies you can tell its coming because they all brace for it, they put their arms up in the air and cross them to save themselves... it never works.the final gem is that these script writers brains are just a gland full o' knowledge. with "facts" such as both of these creatures being amphibious to comments such as "helpless animals" they are just full of fun facts.

this is like a zoology textbook, given that its depiction of animals is so accurate. however, here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film:- handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons. it doesn't matter how many times you shoot at the komodo, bullets just won't go near it.- the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra, or a giant komodo dragon, is just to stand there. the exception to this rule is if you've been told to stay very still, in which case you should run off, until the komodo is right next to you, and then you should stand there, expecting defeat.- minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching.- $5,000 is a memory enhancement tool, and an ample substitute for losing your boating license/getting arrested.- members of elite army units don't see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over-sized beings. maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it.- when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing, a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need; sound gear, a second camera, microphones etc are all superfluous.- when you hear a loud animal scream, and one person has a gun, he should take it out and point it at the nearest person.- when you take a gun out, the sound of the safety being taken off will be made, even if your finger is nowhere near the safety- reporters agree to go half-way around the world in order to expose something - without having the faintest idea what they're exposing. background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism.- handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip, and then more than that in the next clip. despite that, those with guns claim that they will need more ammo.- expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment's hesitation or regret. these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves.- the blonde girl really is the stupid one.- the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it, thus making it unsafe, takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection - and nobody says a word about it.- high-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets.- genetically-modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in a matter of a day, but don't grow at all in the weeks either side.- the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don't meet contact deadlines.- men with guns don't necessarily change the direction they're shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. instead, they just keep shooting into the air.- the better looking you are, the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures.- women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds.- any time you're being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age.- animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for 'swearing' at the same volume.- old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military.

as a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, i tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. this was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy cgi effects and predictable plot points that i ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. the "creature feature" genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (godzilla 2000 anyone?), but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying. it might be worth checking out just for the "make fun of me" potential (count the gunshots!), but i couldn't in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.

so, wynorski remakes curse of the komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. and he adds a cobra. most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. dna experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc. needless to say, it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious do-gooders. lest i forget, there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier-than-thou posse gets picked off one by one, but they probably comprise less than 2% of the film. the main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest dino-crisis video game.the acting is pretty bad overall, even for this sort of film. half the actors seem like they're more concerned with pronouncing every last syllable of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable manner.i actually did make it through to the end, but it's one of those movies i wish i would have recorded and then watched later, because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast forwarded through. overall, i give this effort one star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a b-movie fun to watch. it's a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching boa vs. python.

a group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals. when they arrive, they discover that they are to late. apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra which made them grow very large. i'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to curse of the komodo which also sucked. the computer effects are as cartoony as ever an the komodo roars like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves. like boa vs. python, this movie is not worth seeing and is about as much fun to watch as it is to nail your hand to a table. avoid!

this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. definitely not a well made movie. so unbelievable. the scenes where the president (holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. there would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the president in that situation in real life. if it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a tv movie. it could have been decent if it was done differently. holbrook's (president) talents were never realized in this movie. shatner's acting is okay. the production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired. overall, i think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair.

all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. this is city of god meets happy days. the bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. you can approach it in one of two ways: (1) a gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, abc-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. either way it just don't fly, do it? why then has it received so much praise? as others have implied, it gets the "conscience vote" from the west. show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy, double-wide theatre seats and 44-oz cokes, and we'll applaud in a heartbeat. but--oh--don't forget to candy coat it, because the bitter pill of reality (tantalizing as it is) is hard for us to swallow.i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there. all i can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (hollywood oscars = sweeping, syrupy tripe. cannes film festival = beard-stroking, artless propaganda). to find the real gems, you'll have to work hard at it.

like most musicals of the era, one must check reality at the door. broadway melody of 1938 is not remotely believable nor plausible, but kind of fun in its strange way. this movie is really just an excuse to execute the talents of the stars. some scenes just happen as if they were in a review, not a plot driven movie.judy garland shines and it's a pity she has so little to do unless much was left on the cutting room floor.one of the most inane happenings are the way eleanor powell get a lead role in a broadway show and robert taylor says it's going to be work, work, work from dawn til dusk. several scenes go by and there's no work, no rehearsals...nothing. she needs money to win a horse in an auction. she has no money. isn't she getting paid while she rehearses? taylor has to borrow money to help. he's supposed to be a big time producer. he has no money??? anyway, that's just two elements in this strange story.the musical numbers are quite wonderful which saves this from being a total loss. broadway melody of 1940 is much better as is broadway melody of 1936.

the hindi remake of mrs doubtfire starring and directed by kamal hassan is a somewhat shoddy version, and not as good as expected.kamal hassan clearly struggles with hindi dialogs, even after all these years, and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly. the guy has aged and should give it a rest. hassan doesn't bring anything new to the role or to the character as say, dustin hoffman does to tootsie, or marathi actor macchindranath kambli does to mavshi's (aunt's) character in "moruchi mavshi" (moru's auntie, comedy play).what was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasn't diwali? most of chachi's romantic 'cross-connections' -- vs amrish, paresh and then johny walker, seem redundant to the main storyline. tabu's bathing scene was unnecessary. the family is north indian but must be reminded of karva chauth night by a 'maharashtrian' chachi. yeah, right.the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely tabu, om puri, the late amrish puri and paresh rawal have been wasted in this film.watch the original mrs doubtfire -- clean, crisp and crackling with fun, quite unlike chachi 420.

now i remember what the 'indie' filmmakers were ripping off before pulp fiction. it was david lynch, right?i hunted this thing down to see kyle secor. what a waste of a perfectly good bayliss. it was so painful to watch him, sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there's nothing you can do.nearly every cliche in the book: the desert, the psycho, the quirky mob boss, the biker, tracy walker (who fortunately was only in one scene, but i kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like "if a man wants to know where he's going, he's got to look at where he's been," or some contrived garbage like that). i have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert. i think it's because they can save money on lighting.if you like to be in pain, find this movie and give it a viewing. if you're a fan of kyle secor, watch reruns of homicide on court tv. if you want a good, quirky road thriller, check out wild at heart.there is a reason that no one has heard of delusion! my god, what a waste of a good title.

"delusion" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. this flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the ca desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. the film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. if the flick has anything at all going for it, it's b-movie diva rubin's even performance. don't waste your time on this turkey.

everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. unfortunately very little of "delusion" makes any sense. jennifer rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man kyle secor. secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. jim metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. when jennifer rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between secor and metzler is beyond ridiculous. avoid "delusion", unless you are delusional enough to believe the misguided positive reviews here. - merk

this turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what i hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.ruter hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.the story is so-so. it's not as bad as i'm making out, but it sure isn't anything i'd watch again, and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading.

this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen. however, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. i like to compare it to plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that i find myself laughing out loud.one of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of robin hood, and let be honest and say that i love robin hood with errol flynn, and robin hood: men in tights. but let's face it, from the forbidden love between peck (who is definitely slumming it. although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece to kill a mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgettable, apparently, that i have forgotten her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams "robin hood" all over it.however, i don't think the film isn't worth seeing. on the contrary, i think that this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years, even if it was unintentional.

originally i wrote what was a sarcastic,scathing review of this pathetic piece of dung,but every time i submitted the review i got "this contains a very long word which is not allowed", also words that were not misspelled were judged incorrect. now the word that was judged too long was never identified.after numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually i got the sneaking suspicion that the imdb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically.nothing i wrote was obscene or racist in itself.but after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again,also words that weren't judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelled!the pc police are everywhere.

don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of the time machine is based on an earlier film . it`s not because this is a pointless re- film . that is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the " remake " of the get away from a few years ago . the scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( but with a director like van sant at the helm we should be thankful . he sure ain`t no hitchcock ) in fact i might even be correct in saying the costumes might be the same because the private eye wears a pork pie hat. didn`t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s ? bottom line:avoid

first of all,the whole idea of remaking a classic such as "psycho" is nothing short of ludicrous.a lot of time and effort was wasted here.i am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original,so they must have had a tribute to alfred hitchcock on their minds.however,the idea that began as a well intentioned tribute, results in being a slap in the face to the horror master.this movie is poorly produced,poorly acted,and unnecessary to begin with.the original classic stands well on it's own,even after 40 years.the event of hitch returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely,but if i were them,i would sleep with one eye open just in case.don't waste your time.

let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies "psycho" (1960) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction, poor acting and poor cast. the best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step, acting by acting and process by process to the original.alfred hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors ever lived, had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. okay, people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 oscars. gus van sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. what should have looked realistic in color did not. after the shower scene norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color. about acting, perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of janet leigh and anthony perkins in the original. perkins suited well for norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. in this version, i personally think vince vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play norman's role, unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible. in the motel office where norman and marion have the long conversation, he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout. in the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described, we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on perkins's face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively. vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart. again, terrible acting. same is with anne heche. in the opening scene in the original, we can see how tensed and nervous marion (janet) is when she drives to phoenix. she was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life. that's what i call acting. in the remake, heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money. i don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" when they've just stolen $400000 and the entire state police is behind them. in the shower scene, janet in the original grips the curtain, turns around and dies after getting stabbed. in the remake, heche gets stabbed, turns around, then sways the other way, has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. again, terrible acting.there are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. in the scene where arbogast gets murdered, two scenes blink in between the stabs. one with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. what on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator's murder! the changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. there are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well. let me add some (and the only) positive points along with that. i felt julianne moore did her job well and played a good character of lila. and william macy acted well, that was almost exactly how arbogast's character should have been played.it is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line, and to try and make it look better than the original. and if anything has happened here according to what i just said, it is directly the opposite. unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version. please do not watch this movie, it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not the best.

it's not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. a movie can be bad in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. a case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era. they are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their "badness" is entertaining. however, this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the "piranha" (1978) original. i suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum. now in the mid-2000s with the c.s.i. shows, tv's an absolute blood-fest! (good for us horror fans!)william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies (the original 1978 stars.) it's not katt's and paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. i won't say how because that is part of the plot. this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes here. stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!

i saw this one at sundance, and i can't figure out why it won the directing award. it was painfully slow and literally colorless. it's the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest snobs who think any movie that a lot of people like must be beneath them.the jury at sundance this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdog, ultra-low-budget films. that's all well and good, but this wandering, dragging mess looks like a home movie. mini-dv shot in a snow-covered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab movie.certain motifs (snakes) are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols.now, it wasn't all bad. vera farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. she will be going places, and she deserves it. her co-star hugh dillon also does a fine job. frankly, there are many fine moments in this movie, but they just don't fit together very well.

what is it about drug addiction that so draws first-time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject? this subject has been done to death. drug abuse is bad. we get it. drug addiction is painful to watch. we get that too. but the bleak subject matter doesn't give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film. every film need not be hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence, or use orson wellesian deep focus, but it's still a narrative movie. verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. even consumer mini-dv cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks, and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting: the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy cinematography. and even documentary films have a sound mix. vera farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but the director obviously over-directed her and sucked all the life out of her performance. addicts may live in a fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seem to exist off-screen. the supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people. sorry to be so harsh, debra, but some things are true whether want to believe them or not. i'm sure your next film will be better -- but please, not another drug movie. :)

nothing to watch here. it's all been done (and better) before. who cares about this woman - deficient in every way - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? in one instant when she could have taken the high road - she jumped into re-addiction with both feet and held her breath - for no better a reason than "me, too!" if she wasn't the pretty and young person she portrays on screen - but looked more like the real human wreckage that is represented by our family members, neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions we'd change channels in a nanosecond.this movie starts out at the bottom and goes downhill. nothing redeeming, no lessons taught - nothing uplifting in any way. none of the main characters even evoke sympathy, let alone empathy. (well, maybe the snake.) i would have had more fun if i'd shut a door on my hand. who needs drivel like this?

given the subject matter of drug addiction down to the bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film. but depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. the film has some good things going for it, most notably the quality performance of vera farmiga in the central role of irene, a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. but there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad. the film's failings lie mainly with the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going. irene goes to rehab and comes home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to kick her habit. irene grows close to another recovering addict, a male nurse from her rehab center. complications ensue. but the story never really sparks to life. it doesn't seem as if the movie is really going anywhere. you can say it's a stark, realistic look at the day-to-day struggles of an addict. maybe so but in this case it doesn't make for an interesting movie. the whole thing has a very "blah" feel to it. the minimalist cinematography doesn't help matters, adding another layer of drab to the incredibly drab proceedings. and none of the other performances measure up to farmiga's. hugh dillon is ok as irene's male nurse friend but nobody else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings. all in all this movie is a bleak, depressing and rather dull ride.

this is a semi fictional memoir of an "international man" who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.i was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. i was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. however, i was disappointed by this film. "chico" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. as could be expected, no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. the excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained. the result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.

"the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo. the dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a prime suspect in this death, and some other murders that occur at the theatre. 'the phantom killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim; so, it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.milton raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit. helpfully, dave o'brien (as anthony "tony" woolrich) does well in the lead role; his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him. o'brien and cab driving sidekick frank jenks (as egbert "romeo" egglehoffer) would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team. leading lady kay aldridge (as claudia moore) and the supporting cast are also good. unfortunately, the story becomes meandering, and anti-climactic.**** the phantom of 42nd street (5/2/45) albert herman ~ dave o'brien, kay aldridge, frank jenks

films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me, in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane. the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing, and i love the french cinema.this film was about the mundane. it didn't have a much of a plot. it was just characters who lived in a town, very normal people, and stuff just happened. but it wasn't very interesting stuff, and it wasn't examined very insightfully. the film did capture a bit of a mood, but it wasn't a particularly captivating mood. and while i can't think of much that the film did specifically wrong, it failed on just about every level to do anything right.there were a lot of characters in this film. a lot of them kind of looked alike, so it was hard to figure out who was who, and what were their relations to one another. i don't mind putting some effort into understanding a film, or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details, but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me.the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant--functional, not brilliant, but pleasant. the camera often captured some nice postcard-type shots. but it rarely found the really interesting little details.i've seen a handful of not-so-good films so far at the seattle international film festival, but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled. i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over. but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it.4/10

screen treatment of the comedic broadway success "the gay divorce" (a title which was considered too scandalous for american moviegoers, though it was used in the u.k.) concerns a man and woman (fred astaire and ginger rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. betty grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number "let's k-nock k-nees" with overtly sissified edward everett horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout. the surroundings are screwball-sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one-dimensional. *1/2 from ****

why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie i have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. i have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. the dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. corbin bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. i can't help cringe when i recall some of his lines, like "in or out? you're worse than a cat!" and "your lady friend isn't a very good poker player. she's just revealed her hand."the raptors are a joke. even i could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done. it is an insult to the actual velociraptors, or any dinosaur for that matter. not only that, but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me. i don't seriously think these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look gorier. besides, the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away.i am a big fan of jurassic park movies and of dinosaurs. maybe the filmmakers didn't anticipate anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on hbo late at night, like i did. if i could say one thing to anybody involved in this film, i would have to quote dr. alan grant from the first jurassic park..."just try to show a little respect."

a gut-ripping baby t-rex is on the loose in a small western town, prompting sheriff eric roberts and animal control agent melissa brasselle (who walks through her role in a very disinterest fashion) to get to the bottom of things. they discover that a mad scientist (corbin bernsen) is, unbeknownst to the government sponsorship, continuing on with a long-abandoned us research project called operation jurassic storm (ha!) by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility. before long, our heroes become trapped inside, the marines are called in, the power goes out and the dinos are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on.despite an often infuriatingly inept script full of plot holes, character inconsistencies and loose ends, this direct-to-video copy of jurassic park and carnosaur is fairly digestible trash, thanks to good production values, passable fx, the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action.someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from carnosaur, but anyone used to watching roger corman productions knows he allows directors to liberally reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money.score: 3 out of 10

i understand that roger corman loves to do things on the cheap, but this is just sad. i purchased this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after watching the original carnosaur. i was blown away; it was the same damn movie, with just some corbin bernesen spliced in! it reminded me of all of those 80s ninja movies that took old kung fu movies and spliced in a bunch of white ninjas running doing cartwheels with the word "ninja" written on their headbands (if you haven't seen them, check out "ninja terminator", "the thundering ninja", "black dragon" and "ninja warriors"). thanks roger corman; you just made me waste a dollar.

this movie doesn't even deserve a 1/10 this movie was a scam.i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were deliberetly copied from carnosaur 1, 2, & 3.the whole movie "raptor" was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a "thriller, action packed, dinosaur" copy. i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to.i recommend you see the carnosaur movie first (all of them) and then watch this, and you will know what i mean.- spencer

ok, lets get one thing straight, i love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. so with this in mind lets proceed. "raptor" is a truly awful film, in fact its not even a film in its own right as it is cobbled together from bits of "carnosaur", "carnosaur 2" & "primal species - carnosaur 3". there is some new footage with eric roberts as a sheriff and his busty sidekick running around looking confused, frightened or whatever it is there trying to convey (badly) on the emotional scale but then how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier. the producers (yes roger corman i'm talking about you!) even went to the lengths of hiring 2 people from "carnosaur" to play bit parts so there grisly death scenes can be reused! so this film is the cheapest of the cheap. watch the 3 original movies, there no oscar winners but they have some meritt and entertainment value but avoid "raptor". oh, it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for nearly 10 minutes! do you think they were trying to pad out the running time?

the storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park. the filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. it's funny though, because it's so bad. the acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. no one seems really excited to be in this movie (which i totally understand). especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. the one positive comment note i'd like to make about "raptor" is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes.

so i was sick with the flu one saturday and the silver lining was that scifi channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the "carnosaur" trilogy, "pterodactyl," "raptor island." then i flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie scifi placed in its glamorous, saturday prime-time slot. some movie i had never heard of before called "raptor." i was pretty excited. the movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a velociraptor. i was like, "hmmm, that's odd, that looks almost exactly like a scene in "carnosaur," except it was in the middle of that movie." then i sat through some really bad acting and then some guy was suckered into walking into an underground research laboratory where he got eaten by a ferocious t-rex. now i'm like, "wait a second, that was also a scene in "carnosaur." then, after i saw some scenes blatantly ripped off from "carnosaur 2", i figured out just what the hell was going on. so basically, roger corman & co. ripped off scenes from the "carnosaur" trilogy to use as the action scenes, weaved in a basic "dinosaur-runs-amok" plot, and tried to pass it off as an original movie. shameful. i don't know who i'm more angry at, roger corman or scifi channel for trying to pass this off as worthy of the prime-time slot. the only reason why this was worth watching to its conclusion was to pick out the actors/actresses who looked like their counterparts in the "carnosaur" trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next. as much as it pains me, being a dinosaur lover, i have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating because i feel completely ripped off.

we all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. but raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless carnosaur series, does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it. its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. where do we start? well... the sets are pretty drab. my old drama group created more realistic stages. the genetics labs look like they are from a university, and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside (even for cover-up, why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars), whilst the doctors ward just doesn't look believable at all. next up in the complaints list is the creature effects; well, what can i say? absolutely pitiful. also, i think it's worth mentioning, the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect. both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob-jobs, and it brings the characters down, being one female is a respected member of police, whilst the other is the sweet, "innocent" daughter of the towns sheriff. the acting, though, is by far the worst tragedy. eric roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something. thats where it ends. corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic, whilst the female lead looks so bored (though, with this film you could let her off). the other character i'll point out is the daughter, who lets her tits do all the acting in the "raunchy" sex scene (ten minutes of endless re-run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke).all in all, and summed up as one. don't bother, just don't.

i bought a dvd collection (9 movies for 10 euros) where this one was included. it turned out to be the "uncut version" whatever that means. beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange - the soft sex scene. it started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts. after around 2 minutes i had an expression on my face which fitted the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits (at this point the term breasts is a bad choice) is far beyond from entertainment.the rest of the movie was more like "people aren't /that/ stupid, are they?" lucky me, the dvd was scratched and i got my money back.

the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits,but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty,check on the dinosaurs.keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this.also keep in mind it's a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is evil and doesn't like him.but he's still like,yeah okay.that just defined the stupidity in this movie.one melissa brasselle proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies.i can go ride a mountain-bike between them,but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice.eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far,there's no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout.corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him,but they have to stick to the formula of course.and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like,one of the army guys in this one?how low can your acting career go?the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying "studio 3" to get into the frame.it's not even honest pulp,it's all taken from "carnosaur",which even sucked all by itself.and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie.

the biggest and most disconcerting things of the raptor movie was ending for the tyransaurus is identical to carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. the similarities to the carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. then the plot went down hill from there. would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. the raptor movie should have taken lesson from jurasic park series in various plots. the only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is aztec rex. the repeated scenes as if taken from the carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies.

first of all, i would like to clarify that i consider this one of the funniest films i have ever seen. i have watched it almost 10 times just because i've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. it has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. it has all the writing of a wwe match. and most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. this movie is a masterpiece.the film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three, drunken teens in the desert. this scene convinced me that i was onto something big when i picked this film from the dvd rack (being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor yelling the word "raptor" on the front of it). the scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts at humour and rubbery dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie. this movie is a masterpiece.the film contains erratic backdrops and prop use that causes one's mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film. an example is when a truck, in the middle of the night, is parked beside a cliff wall. the very next day, they find it in an open grassy area. the driver couldn't have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an unnamed bipedal carnivore (i will explain why it's unnamed in a second). so, my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it, the livestock the driver was transporting did it, or jim wynorski doesn't think very highly of his viewers. hell, in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesn't have gutters, the fire hydrant is precariously placed next to a phone booth, and there's only a single street light. yet, still, i feel compelled to watch and re-watch this film, just so i can find more things that will make me giggle the next time i watch it. this film is a masterpiece.the directing on this film is horrific. long extended pauses. strange cuts to characters that weren't even in the general vicinity of the conversation. people discussing things casually while facing the camera (and in turn, making them face the wall). they can't even give the dinosaur a coherent species, flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet (distinguished by the intensely long, fat, disproportionate claw). this film is a masterpiece.the editing is prominent on this film. this is not a good thing. i am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap, but there has to be a limit! sub plots end as abruptly as they began. explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to, well, not being explained at all! and an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt. you just never know what is going to happen because the film doesn't follow a coherent structure. this film is a masterpiece.now, i'm going to just have to mention a single scene (the greatest one) that occurs near the end. this is a spoiler, but not really. the final scene contains a showdown between tyrannosaurus rex and sheriff tanner. it is like the showdown between sigourney weaver and the alien queen in aliens, except without all the emotional power/budget/epic battling. it pretty consists of tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. a white bobcat. in a space of several minutes, through a series of sneakily slipped in cuts, the director manages to turn that white bobcat into a yellow forklift/crane looking piece of machinery. now, as i said, i know that this film is made from scenes from other films, but what two films warrant a showdown with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? this film is a masterpiece.this film gets a 1/10 for quality of film making, but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself.

this movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. it fails at even this, since there's way too much "plot", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. the performances are c-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the spec-ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre east coast/venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct. cinematographically, it's non-offensive, pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (just like the script). the fact that new concorde used footage from the "carnosaur" films is offensive, and quite confusing. for shame, new concorde. for shame. "carnosaur" is one of my favorite terrible movies, and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable. see the "carnosaur" films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem.i give it one star because i am so fond of the movies it steals from, and also because the scale doesn't have a zero.

oy vey... jurrasic park got corman-ized. as usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (i've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes). and all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film. all the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for fredrick's of hollywood. the raptor itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the "motion" shots. if you want a good movie to sit around and heckle mst3k style, this is gold. if you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a roger corman film. acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try. story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad. special effects gets a 2 out of 10, i've seen worse, but not many.

**********spoiler alert***************if you happen to like jurassic park 1, 2, or 3:if you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality (case in point-john carpenter's dark star-highly recommended)if you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general-then stay away from this cinematic crapsterpiece!the shameless use of stock footage from carnosaur 1 & 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino/slasher flick- take the scene, for instance, where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the alpha t-rex. for some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. why is that? simply because this scene was lifted directly from carnosaur, which was a crummy flick to begin with.the ending was a carbon copy of carnosaur 2, for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight-to-video loser. again, we see mr. rex do battle against a bulldozer-which alternates as a forklift truck-through the miracle of -ta-daa!- stock footage from the aforementioned carnosaur 1 & 2. of course, the ending is exactly the same-the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames.a real insult to anyone's intelligence.but it's still better than watching the rosie o' donnel show.rating: 1/2* out of *****

the worst film ever, with characters from carnosaur 1-3 inserted merely to fall to the same demise that they had in the first film, so that footage and special effects could be reused.stay away from this debacle.corman is ruining his legacy. he made and produced some amazing films - but that era ended with carnosaur being his last "creative in its badness" film.

on the bright side, it ended. that's the only thing this movie has going for it, of course.this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen some bad ones. this movie is actually so horrible, i went and changed my rating for children of the living dead to a 2 just for not being raptor.official one-liner rating: "come with me to another movie if you want to live."

this movie is sad. according to my fellow imdb users, (*spoiler*) raptor uses stock footage from the carnotaur films. well, since i have not seen the carnotaur movies, i cannot say. but, i do notice some pretty bad editing and even worse acting. this movie is one big steaming pile of s***. it makes absolutely no sense. here is this thing that calls itself a plot: mad scientist re-creates raptors. raptors kill people. sheriff investigates. *spoiler* (although i don't know what it is that i'm spoiling) sheriff catches on to mad doctor's plans. army guys are sent in and raptors start killing army guys. raptors. yeah, right. i could make a clay figure that looks more real. the fx are the cheapest ever used in a movie. there is a lot of gore. cheap gore. it doesn't even look real. i will agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie has going for it is the fact that it ends. there are about two seconds of originality in this film. and that only comes from when the sheriff is talking to some tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something. this idea has been used in about 100,000 other movies with 100,000 different names. overall, i'm gonna give raptor 1/5 just because it ended.

i was surprised after watching this piece of crap , if you have seen an episode of tom and jerry in which jerry pours some liquid onto him and becomes invisible than you are likely to see the same cartoons with added erotic topping a man becoming invisible and doing s*i* is the conclusion of the movie. involving too much sex in a cartoon themed movie doesn't increase its worth :( , and most of all i was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show up the mr.invisible and that was really awful i must say , flour drops off the rack and our very own mr.invisible becomes visible "watch zack and miri make a porno" i bet you wont get bored, 1/10 from me

after just viewing the movie, i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. this takes my worst movie award away from komodo, which is no easy feat. it is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. the acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. my personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. why was a joke such as this put in the film? was the director thinking; "i need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so i will use some lame ass joke i read on a laffy taffy wrapper." another retarded part is when norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling. why did they even bother to give the film a nc-17 rating, were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible? at least if it were rated x it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality. i pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond.

i rented this type of "soft core" before, but i can honestly say, i wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as "rod steele: you only live until you die"--which was both sexy and funny. it had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. it also has gabriella hall who is hot. the reason why i didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the "must be 18 to rent" sticker. i was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake."first of all, i think movies shouldn't be allowed to start with "actors" rehearsing for a part at a talent agency (or wherever "actors" rehearse). in this movies seeing the "actors" rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movie.okay, having found out that this was a soft core movie, i didn't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. but, the dizzying way the extended video "erotic" scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to fast-forward through without the sustained quality of, say, rod steele. you know they must've had some money, because i think some of it is filmed overseas.i will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs i've ever seen. and, i've seen torgo from manos! it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee (that and gabriella hall). still, there are better corny movies to rent with your friends.

what can have been on irene dunne's mind when she accepted the role in this distasteful account of a woman of negotiable morals? certainly, the irene dunne of the 1940's, whose reputation as a faithful roman catholic who publicly abhorred smut, and shunned any film scripts or hollywood society, that might be even be remotely construed as corrupting public morals--would never have become associated with such a dubious project as this.perhaps, new york's cardinal spellman, in his private audience with her, gave her a good dressing down over this role? that we will likely never know, inasmuch as she never spoke of it in later years, though she did denounce her morally suspect, (though quite successful) 1932 film, "back street" as "trash".certainly by the time she received the distinguished st. robert bellarmine award in 1965 for exemplary public catholicism, "ann vickers" was no longer recalled by the general public.suffice it to say that "ann vickers" works neither as entertainment or social commentary.miss dunne's role as an adulterous social worker, who sleeps around, (between reforming prisons and writing a best seller on correctional rehabilitation) doesn't dovetail with her temperament or on screen demeanor, and one keeps suspecting that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheek gag, (what else can we think when we witness a montage of miss dunne's sympathetic beatific gaze superimposed over a shot of a female prisoner being scourged?) by films end, she has renounced careerism in favor of marriage, (to crusty convict walter huston no less--and what kind of lunacy would ever conceive of pairing these two romantically?) irene dunne completists will no doubt wish to see this curiosity, if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her charge: "i'm going to get you off the snow cold turkey" !!! well, if nothing else such sordid goings on, do present her light years from her usual milieu of operatic trills, furbellowed chiffon and strawberry phosphates--cocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the irreproachable miss dunne.

not one of monogram's better(not trying to be amusing here either)chan entries. the shanghai cobra has a lot going for it, but, in the end, is just way too confusing and cluttered to be overly satisfying. the film opens with a murderer named the shanghai cobra having already struck twice and now is about in a scene at a diner in some way. we have a guy, a girl, and another guy having some implied connection when one guy dies in the streets. yes, i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation. i haven't even gone into the diner cook who has some involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with that! all this is in the first five minutes or so. then chan enters film working for the government and flying out to help a friend. he also has right to check a bank's store of radium and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped arrest in shanghai many years earlier. i found the plot very involved as stated earlier. toler is back as chan. he is ever affable. benson fong and mantan moreland are back too. both do good jobs and are quite amusing. but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance. this isn't a bad movie not just a very interesting one except for the most devoted of chan fans.

loosely based on novels by earl derr biggers, 20th century fox's charlie chan series proved an audience favorite--but when japan attacked pearl harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its asian hero. this was a miscalculation: actor sidney toler took the role to "poverty row" monogram studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947.20th century fox had regarded the chan films as inexpensive "b" movies, but even so the studio took considerable care with them: the plots were often silly, but the pace was sharp, the dialogue witty, and the casts (which featured the likes of bela lugosi and ray milland) always expert. the result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time. monogram was a different matter: chan films were "b" movies plain and simple. little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat, mediocre at best, virtually unwatchable at worst.thanks to an adequate cast and a few interesting plot devices, the shanghai cobra is among the best of the monogram-made chan films--but even so it barely manages to achieve a consistent mediocrity. in this particularly entry, chan (sidney toler) is called upon to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra-like bite; at the same time, he decides to make certain that a government supply of radium tucked away in a bank vault, of all places, remains secure. do these two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together? well... could be! sidney toler is always enjoyable as chan, but most of his monogram performances seemed "phoned in"--and that is as true of cobra as it is of any monogram chan film. as usual, the really enjoyable performer is mantan mooreland. changing times have led us to look upon moreland's brand of comedy as demeaning to african-americans, but he was an expert actor and comic, and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence.fans of the 20th century fox series are likely to find monogram's chan a significant disappointment and newcomers who like the monogram films will probably consider them third-rate after encountering the fox films. like other monogram chan films, the shanghai cobra is best left to determined collectors. four stars, and that's being generous.gft, amazon reviewer

i just spent the last half an hour reading through the other reviews and i don't know if i want to laugh or cry. there's no way that adjl is like harry potter, danny phantom, fairly oddparents, other then a secret magical world, which has been close to overdone. also, no way is adjl anime. anime is very much a drawing style(and some will say more, such as plot and japanese origin), either way adjl is not anime so stop saying it is and if you're looking for something that is like anime, look else where, like teen titans and avatar.adjl is typical. it's just like all the other disney shows. an arrogant main character kid who thinks he knows everything and doesn't bother to listen to people who're older than him and continues to make the same mistakes. best friend sidekicks. repeative plot with a hint of a twist. and sibling rivalry. can't they once make a character that has brains and isn't full of himself? can't they have kids respect their elders? can't they think of something different with the plot? can't they have the siblings get along and not hate each other? adjl is just too generic, because you also have bad guys that get defeated and come back again, and are also complete idiots, that have no background for their hate. c'mon, you'll think that someone who's at least 30 will be able to out-wit a 13 year old.watching adjl is like watching nearly anything else on tv these day, same thing over and over again. nothing special, just new designs characters and one small idea that has been used again and again.

not really worth a review, but i suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this canadian bomb floating around out there... bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. at firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model... however all this changes... and you still won't care. you will recognize chris penn, whose biggest cinematic impact is corky romano, and a young devon sawa, whose career peaked at 'casper'. i was hoping for a '12 and holding', 'the war', or 'lie' and all i got was a waste of time. this film struggles to keep it's audiences attention and never makes an impact or maintains a note of anything remotely interesting.

this was an attempt toward a romantic comedy, and one which did not work. although the film was cast in an interesting manner, the dismal script betrayed the best efforts of all. the director's fey mannerisms may have succeeded if he had adopted a point of view. it was embarrassing to watch william baldwin and, in particular, armin muller-stahl.

not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that john leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. in fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.while the film is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. the over the top performance by william baldwin doesn't help the situation either. john leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better. the basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way. the result is an uneven film.

!!!! mild spoilers !!!!the premise goes like this : a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees .so far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ? come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( a very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ? i know i wouldn`t , and seeing as you`d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is $25,000 dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques ? there`s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise , since mister lumpke has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems unware of the possibility that he may know too much . wouldn`t alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something ? i guess we`re not suppossed to think about such details since a pyromaniac`s love story isn`t suppossed to be an intelligent thriller , it`s a light hearted romantic comedy/ chick flick that`s probably best apprieciated as a girls night in . looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male i wasn`t too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top

started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all. the scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film. the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off. glad i didn't pay to see it. didn't laugh or even smile once. there seems to be a strange tendency for americans to classify their films as 'comedy' when they are funny peculiar rather than funny ha ha. i have finally learned to avoid what americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny. now it looks like i will have to be a bit more discerning when they call a film romantic comedy as well. maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in america. i don't understand why america can produce amazingly funny comedies like two and a half men, will and grace, king of queens but can't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour. this film wasn't gross or anything. but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...

laughable.clichéd.overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing.remember when mtv actually used to air music videos and other shows besides reality shows? aeon flux (2005) is based upon one such show  a cartoon from the mid-90s  featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. aeon, played by the lovely charlize theron in this adaptation, is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line-dancer and as deadly as a viper-snake. she needs to be, if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government.i love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian technology-overdosed films like the island (2005) and equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). aeon flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but amplified. that is, there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that matrix (1999) catalyzed. the special effects are therefore sensational in aeon flux which earns it a few points, but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there.to make matters worse, all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch. charlize theron's character aeon flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough-chick schtick and it seems as though the director karyn kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next  should she make her more detached or more emotional? she doesn't know! let's go both ways! imagine you take a shotgun, load it chock-full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess. this is the character of aeon flux.the film aeon flux puts forward all the 'mandatory' ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotion vs. cold reason, etc. you've seen all of this before, and better done at that. go read orwell, bradbury or huxley, or even watch logan's run (1976) or blade runner (1982)... anything! avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese-fest for as long as you can.3/10

i got to know æon back in the early 90s via television and i loved it...what did you like about it ? the cranky drawing style ? the flawless artistic action involved ? the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters ? the whole layout of the surrounding future world ? no matter what you loved about it...the aeon flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that.karyn kusama, the so called "director" of the film, was hopelessly over-strained with transporting the original content to a new film. if you 're not familiar with the original series, you won't understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.the story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film.kusama's attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller , it's simply unworthy of the original æon concept.charlize theron might be an attractive woman, but she can't impersonate the æon character. although she was attached to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film. the result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique.forget about all the rest, it's not worth talking about...i give 1point for ms.theron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film. that's it.

while aeon flux was mildly entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a wednesday evening than the pub, i did leave pleased that i had got buy one get one free tickets. knowing nothing about the film as i went in, in fact i didn't even know there was an animated series before i read this site, i was ready for anything, and as some other viewers noted, the trailers showing a well filmed, good looking, and interesting piece of cinema had pulled me in. half way through the film though i was kind of disappointed, it did remind me of the fifth element but i too feel it just lacked the extra bit of depth and left me with the empty feeling. and enough of the pointless and slightly boring gun fights, if you're going to do them, do it with some style, not just loads of explosions and inept guards falling down. personally i'd rather have seen a bit more about the story and the people in the city or got to know more about how the chairman was being undermined, than yet another long and loud gun fight.

critics have started calling it the oscar winner club, understandably. what after halle berry won it for monsters ball then going straight to the diabolical catwoman. hilary swank triumphs in boys don't cry and follows it with the core. jamie foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull stealth after scooping a gong for ray. now it's seems hollywood starlet charlize theron craps all over her "monster" oscar with this one of the worst sci-fi spectacles ever made.the film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish charlize theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise. not only is æon flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it's also really very dull. it will only really appeal to comic book fans and horney teenagers who like the idea of theron running around half naked for 90 minutes. flux only really succeed in failing.set against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world's populace, and in the last city on earth, bregna, the survivors, some four hundred years later, in the year 2415, are continuing to live in the goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed its cure.all is not well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the never ending jungle but what unspoken, unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unfortunates' together that lies within these walls of paranoia, conformity and unquestionable obedience. filmed in and around berlin, ironically, this is a story set against a totalitarian state, a walled city, where its peoples are no longer capable of reproducing, and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life.æon flux is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of mankind, forever. this is the story of her fight for justice, freedom and revenge.æon flux combined lousy narratives, ropy pacing and truly dire effects. looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film. the only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works, flux might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank god for the lousy box office takings then.my final verdict on this truly lousy feature? there really isn't a story here just charlize theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper. the acting is very wooden moronic and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that are out there today. it try's too much to be like an adaption and doesn't really take much from the cartoon which is what i was expecting, the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene. avoid at all costs.

right up (or down) there with toys and jurassic park 2 and the phantom menace.the premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness, and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot.if you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it. the plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. too bad too, because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope. it may be the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen a lot. bottom line - don't watch it.unless of course you -liked- any of the above 3 movies.

the mtv sci-fi animated series "æon flux" is brought to life with charlize theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. for her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader trevor goodchild (marton csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.aeon flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. interesting story yet the film was a little dull. a lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. it may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. i have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so i can't compare the two. it's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. the film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. the acting was alright, nothing special. charlize theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. the rest of the cast also give decent performances including jonny lee miller, frances mcdormand and marton csokas. there are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including sithandra, aeon's friend.the problem with aeon flux is that it takes itself too seriously. it carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. there's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. this is the same problem that elektra had. because the film is so serious, the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. the action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie. the twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (hide and seek). the costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. the visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. so, the movie may be a case of style over substance. interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. in the end, it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. rating 4/10

if you're a fan of the original series, do not see this movie.i should have been skeptical from the previews when aeon expresses her motives for murder. in the series aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the "bad grrl" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.you wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. the characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved. all dogs go to heaven, and same for every character that dies in this movie.the selfish,twisted,perverted, dominating personas of aeon and trevor are nowhere to be seen. in the end they literally develop into a cutesy couple ala annie hall. the only character who remained true to the show was the relicle, the floating machine in the sky. i suppose if you ever thought "gee, i like aeon flux, but i wish it were more like every other faceless good-v-evil sci-fi hollywood slop out there", then you are in for a treat.they didn't even get the look right. i suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for, but the whole setting is wrong. 400 years into the future sure looks like 30 years into the past. instead of a distinctly urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are offended with a 70's mod-squad frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, wood paneled walls, earth tones, and lots of plants. bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia.speaking of bregna, that's the only city on earth according to the movie. the show is clear that there are two cities, bregna and monica, which used to be one. in the movie, the "monicans" are just hollywood storybook freedom-fighters. they also have as much technology as the bregnans, which is not the case from the show.the only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid, and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio execs, and he's never seen an entire aeon flux all the way through. the overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is baffling. beyond using certain names like aeon flux, trevor goodchild, and bregna, the movie is nothing like the show.the actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of soy-lent green, blade runner, logan's run, and tomb raider, which came out a dull brown mess.

it's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. that many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. consider it an early christmas gift from hollywood, then, that "aeon flux" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around. too bad director karyn kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it all.it's the future. there's been a plague. there is a dictatorship, and there are rebels. the latter are known as the monicans, and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers, they're into attempts to overthrow the former, called the goodchild regime. the regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry, which is more than aeon flux (charlize theron) and her pals can stand. through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology, the monicans receive orders from their dear leader (frances mcdormand), a mystical priestess-type who appears to have been cross-bred with a carrot. it falls to aeon to strap on some form-fitting, futuristic spandex get-ups to carry out the high carrot's orders, which are of course some version of "destroy the regime." having years earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the goodchilds, she needs little convincing.not surprisingly, things get complicated. the goodchilds might not be quite what they seem, and aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them. though occasionally muddled, the film's central conceit (of which i won't reveal more) contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival. there's room for much more examination of which the film doesn't take advantage, but the ideas are there, at least. the big problems of "aeon flux" are technical. kusama has made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what's going on. to make matters worse, it's edited in a flurry of jump cuts that leave us completely lost. the result is some serious spacial disorientation that takes over the film. "aeon flux"'s aesthetic is one of sleek costume, oddly-angled architecture, and nimble characters. much of the action occurs in minimalist, open spaces that beg for some unbroken long shots that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above. instead, we get split seconds of flying limbs, breaking glass, and accompanying sound effects.there is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of "aeon flux." put this stuff in the hands of the wachowski brothers, say, and the results could be quite different. as it is, though, i felt like "aeon flux" was willfully pushing me away from a movie i wanted to enjoy. this film is unattuned to its own strengths. like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush, it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential.

in the animated series: aeon flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. she was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, ambiguous all at once. the original aeon had layers upon layers of depth. she almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. the original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. you could never tell what aeon's motives were. aeon was a militant anarchist whereas trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.in the movie:aeon flux works for the monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. she was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. the aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. the plot was obvious and contrived. everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. there was virtually no conflict between aeon and trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. the only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.the movie was a horrible disappointment to me. i felt betrayed. they took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of hollywood clichés. the essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie. the only reason i'm not giving this movie a "1" is because the visuals were incredible. it was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with cgi.

joan crawford is convincingly disfigured as our story starts, and of course she get fixed up. but she's a bad egg, exploiting one guy, while living out another guy's anti-social philosophy. all of this takes place in sweden, which is truly bizarre. it causes anything and everything memorable in the visuals, which are freed from having to depict anytown usa, but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake since is burdened and rendered unspecific by the need to americanize everything. there is plot, plot, plot so chatty that you could drown in it, and making matters worse is a framing device that adds zilch to the movie. the photography is occasionally nice, with odd angles and miniatures incorporated quite well. but it's overwrought without ever once drawing you in.

this film is a cash in. a cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. yul brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. lee van cleef takes over the lead role of chris. i can't think of any actor who looks less like brynner than van cleef. hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. one step out of line and the magnificent seven ride! is brought to the fore and wielded. they didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a tv movie! abysmal.

the series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which was (thank god) the last one. none of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the "magnificent seven" and bernstein's rousing music theme. the production values resemble those of a made-for-tv movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts "ii" and "iii" you couldn't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces. lee van cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of chris, but nobody could have replaced yul brynner in our minds anyway. don't waste your time.

i would bet a month's salary "the magnificent seven returns" (msr) was made-for-tv. other reviewers attest that msr was a theatrical movie, and i'll take their word for it. the logical answer must assume it was originally shot for tv, and after a change-of-studio-heart, it was released theatrically instead. every actor is primarily a tv actor: mariette hartley, michael callen, ralfe waite, stephanie powers... tv performers all. lee van cleef split his time between tv and theater screens. stephanie powers has only made 3 or 4 "real" movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - proof positive this was shot for tv. minor players are veteran small-screen actors who can be seen on old reruns of "gunsmoke", "wild wild west," "streets of san francisco," and so on.the ho-hum sets are identical to the universal studios tour sets, often seen in old episodic tv. and the editing betrays the one-or-two-takes-hurriedness of tv, with limited camera movements, positioning, cutting, and lighting. the sound track, exclusive of the original berstein themes, are straight from seventies television. yep, i'd bet money it was shot for tv.that's an important point in evaluating msr. initially i watched msr on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release. in comparison to the original "magnificent seven", it's a joke, a cartoon, an amateurish attempt at movie making. acting, lighting, writing, settings, action, cinematography, music (exempting the berstein themes), editing, pacing,...on and on....all pale in comparison to the classic "magnificent seven" which is close to the perfect 60's western, and one of the great action movies of all time. however, viewed as an early 70's made-for-tv movie, as i suspect, the film is actually better than average. those unfortunate enough to live through the 70's as an adult, know what i'm talking about. msr would have competed against "alias smith and jones" and similarly bland network shows. during the seventies, "gunsmoke" was a quality show, concentrating on character development rather than action, deemphasizing gun play to two shootouts a week. the first shooting, usually a murder, sets the hour's plot into motion - the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star, his nemesis, or otherwise resolving the conflict with marshal matt dillon. msr has more action than a whole season of "gunsmoke." in this light - in this frame of reference - msr is passable entertainment, a cut above the tv fare from that decade.

i guess i should now comment upon a 4th flick in the magnificent seven franchise; the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. they constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic, not revisionist, not europeanbut a sleaze americana, kindred to the violent vigilante '70s movies, absurd trash. this installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange.now what i find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original's style and the sequels'.these sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre. they are of course very badly writtenmessy scripts, rubbish lines. it's straight crazy; in this installment each gunman gets several women van cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner; he finally does. the young man resumes his life, shoots van cleef, kidnaps the wife, rapes and kills herthen joins a wrongdoer. van cleef, who has previously refused to help defending a village, now assembles a small bunch and charges the wrongdoer's hacienda; then the wrongdoers charge the village where van cleef has set.i liked the cast.van cleef is chris; stefanie powers, pretty active in the '70s screwy westerns, is van cleef's darling. callan, very antipathetic, is noah, a writer and chris' sidekick. the rest of the aggressive bunch are askew (one of the only three survivors), armendariz, lucking, lauter; rita rogers is truly hot, fleshy beauty.

the director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns. have a look at the outfits. everybody looks well-scrubbed, well-brushed, well-dressed and well-ironed as though ready for church. even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. this is a western, for crying out loud! it's supposed to look dusty, nasty and sweaty. and then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird. the whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well-endowed, were just freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows. instead they all look with great interest (if not downright lust) at the newly arrived magnificent seven who they subsequently feed, bandage and comfort with love during their battles with the bandits. the same directing criticism goes for lee van cleef, who does a reasonable good acting job. our lee, playing the law, just lost his dear wife. but lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion whatsoever and finds himself within days of his spouse's demise in the arms of a juicy widow with whom he, together with her brood, walks off into the future. the cad. and then there's another thing that always kind of bothers me with this type of films: it doesn't matter how many dynamite-induced explosions take place in the middle of a pack of some 50 horses, never mind how many shots are being fired at the rabble on top of them, only the crooks get killed and the nags always go their way rejoicing in one piece. (i know...silly moi...it's just a movie...). it's not the worst western ever made, but prepare for some serious yawning.

i had high hopes for this film when i saw the listing and decided to watch it on tv, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. i've liked lee van cleef in many movies but i'm afraid that having the other characters call him chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of yul brenner's chris.i found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original. the rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film. i guess if you haven't seen the original it would be okay. too many clichés and too little depth to the characters. i missed the humanity and compassion and the three dimensional characters of the original.

i really wanted to love this movie, and not only cause it had aaron eckhart in it but i thought the premise would be cool cause i enjoy movies and shows that revolves around chefs. the cinematography was good but besides it being revolved around chefs everything else is just very cliché. oh and little miss sunshine was very irritating in this movie although abigail breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is whinny. it has some decent flashes of cooking, but food really didn't play a big part in the movie than i expected which was a big disappointment for me. this film had some good potential, the cast was great but they just had very little to work with. i like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland. and longer than it should be cause it felt way longer than it is. it's not a terrible movie, you just won't miss anything by not watching this movie.4.5/10

i'm really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis, i'm just going to say that i'm extremely disappointed that catherine zeta-jones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd, nonsense, in this full of clichés boring to death thoughtless pathetic try in film-making! there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie, because as a whole it is poor in every single way, and the saddest thing is that zeta-jones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the clichés, that she has absolutely no chance of showing even 1% of her talent!avoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall!!!

when i saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. i expected some light fluffy fun. instead, i was bored and a little depressed.honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. the little girl was adorable - when she cried, i cried - but i thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music. i'm not anti-opera, but i would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters, who were all stiff and underdeveloped.i was really disappointed in this movie. the whole time i watched it i kept thinking of how much better it could have been.

the initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what? there is a scarecrow murdering people there. only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes. meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people, one by one. whats the scarecrows secret? will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all? this is a low budget movie and it shows. sound is ok but picture is really corny. the plot/script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical. the acting is really bad and sometimes just laughable. cant really say much about the special effects cause there aren't that many but the few there is ranges from bad to ok(for a low budget that is). there is some nudity and thats probably the only thing worth to watch in the movie(that is if your a horny teenager, if not, skip the movie all together). another complete waste of time and money so don't see it. goes for hack'n'slash fans too.

i supposed 'scarecrow gone wild' is a dull slasher flick. yes, it have some good point, but it's a rehash from another flick. the acts is so awful nor the plot. the story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. when an initiation become a prank and cause the life a boy in jeopardy, the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy. sound familiar, right? it's derived from scream, friday the13th, jeepeer creepers, children of the corn, you name it!'scarecrow gone wild' is so below average film. barely have a scary moment. even the final scene is laughable! sadly, we still could enjoy it as our time killer. but i prefer you to watch something else instead. unless you're a big fan bad and cheesy movies, off course.4/10

so unfortunately me and my mate watched this!!! it was showing on a sky channel over here called "zone horror" which basically shows crappy b-movie horror films 24/7. it was a boring friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look. apart from the atrocious acting, the awful plot, the dire effects, the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing ridiculousness of it all, it was ok, lol!!! in all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors. there is a bit of semi-nudity which perked the movie up a bit, unfortunately it was the "uggo" who got topless as my mate calls her :od if you're bored one evening and this happens to be playing, take a chance, you just might like it :)

"scarecrow gone wild: he's the death of the party!" need i say more? scarecrow gone wild got four out of ten stars from me for one simple reason: aside from the terrible acting, plot holes, cheap special effects, and anti-climactic whistling, it was cinematic gold! i think that this movie could have actually been really good, had the scarecrow turned out to be the baseball coach (as portrayed by the ever-so-brilliant ken shamrock). but then again, they would have had to cut those awesome "return of the jedi" electricity special effects.while watching this movie, my friends and i were convinced that it was in fact written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teen-aged boy. this movie has topless women, miserably fake gore, and dialog that could not have talked its way out of a paper bag, or in this case, a cornfield.if i could ask the filmmaker one thing, it would be this; "how much did you have to pay the teenager that wrote this for you?"

jerk hazer mike(david zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away)and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic sam(caleb roehrig)hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story. they get po'd at sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at mike that lands across his girlfriend patty(kristina sheldon)instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment. somehow, sam's soul "emerges" with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot. mike and the gang send the uninitiated dorks back to bring sam down but they are the first to receive a swinging blade across their throats. mike and his posse head for the beach to gulp booze, play volleyball & bicker until the scarecrow arrives to end their little soirée. sam's substitute brother jack(matthew linhardt)is supposed to look out for him, but decides to sleep with new love-interest beth(samantha aisling)instead. so when he receives a cell-phone message from mike concerning how they left sam hanging on the cross while they were off at the beach taking in the sun and sand, jack is frenzied with fear. beth's estranged father is a doctor and he agrees to see after sam's condition after they cut the nearly dead young man down taking him to emergency hospital. returning to the beach to confront mike because of his negligence(..not to mention jack's promise to coach ramsey, played by ufc fighter ken shamrock, regarding no hazing), jack and beth will face the same straw-stuffed assassin that is bumping off the others. coach ramsey, who was part of a past hazing incident that went awry causing killer-scarecrow-mischief, has to confront some demons himself as he informs the survivors of the group about what they are up against.babes, boobs, and blood..this flick follows the basic slasher guidelines. yet, this flick also carries the typical slasher traits of corny characters, acting, dialogue and overall plot. the flick shows signs of it's low budget particularly in the violence as most of the real action takes place off-screen instead of showing it happening up, close & personal. what appears on screen is mostly the aftermath of the killer's vengeance:one fellow holding his guts, another with a stake(holding up the group's volleyball net) plunged through his chest, blood spatter after a woman gets hit over the head presumably with a large rock, one chick laying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the suv, etc. there is also some dubbing problems where it's clear the sounds of their voices often don't match the movements of their lips..particularly the unintentionally hilarious sequence where ed(travis parker), wannabe rock star, is singing to his buddies a horrible song they all seem quite impressed with.

i cannot believe i let myself rent that piece of garbage! the acting was so poor, my grandmother could have done better. the punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the scarecrow was knocking to the floor. the movie became a chore to watch! so this group of baseball jocks decide to go hazing, even after they weren't supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences. so, naturally, they go anyway. they decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called "scarecrow." when the loser's best friend finds out about this, him and his girlfriend go to rescue him.the kid is found out to have diabetes, and is hospitalized, while the jocks head out to the beach the next day. the scarecrow finds them there and kills them all pretty much.i'm sure you really don't care. anyway, the scarecrow ends up having a connection with "diabetes boy" and the boy starts to finish off the scarecrows job once the scarecrow is killed. yes, it is really really cheesy.it thought this movie was full of bull sh*t. sooner or later the only ones living (naturally) are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters :) the evil is then transfered to the boyfriend, and he kills himself to break the curse so nobody else will be hurt. touching hey? no, don't waste your hard earned money on this, i give it a score of a one since thats lowest, otherwise, it doesn't even deserve that much.

my roommate and i have another friend that works at a local blockbuster video. he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them. one of them was a "christmas horror" film starring former professional wrestler bill goldberg as a killer satna claus. we didn't watch it immediately, but we didn't think there could be anything worse. apparently, we were wrong. we were shown this slasher film "starring" ken shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow. at first we thought ken would actually be the killer scarecrow, and that's why we wanted to watch, but he wasn't, and that made the movie even worse. what absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama. if you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, never ever watch this movie.

wow! here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. if the cheap-looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride, then the diabolically tragic "writing" sure will.a diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team. then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people. need i say more? this movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with imovie (note that spooky color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late-night cinemax special. actually, thats not fair, as the actors didn't have much room to work around the abysmal script. parts of this movie really seem like parody, especially when one character picks up his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by humans, with the worst lip-synching ever performed to go along with it. the "gore" here is also a major disappointment. in most b-movies such as this, there is a thick layer of cheap gore fx to make up for what the story and acting lacks. here, the stuff is so cheap that it's not even fun. this movie actually makes "jack frost 2" look like lots of fun in comparison.if you think this movie is the "worst one you've ever seen" then you probably haven't gotten deep into the world of straight-to-video b-horror. regardless, this movie will cause you a great deal of mental anguish, no matter what your background.

... with a 500$ budget and a bottle of ketchup.if you are a fan of c movies with no talented actors whatsoever, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and lousy camera-work, this film delivers.all others be warned. you could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder.the film is good for some laughs though. watch it with some friends and discuss how not to make a movie.2/10 for unintentional comedy.why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? i have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler.

normally i love finding old (and some not-so-old) westerns i haven't seen, to be the entertainment for the evening. it's such a great way to sit back, relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours. but this was not to be the case with this version of the magnificent seven. the casting and storyline of this series closely follow the hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old get-your-mind-right, revisionist history, where the 'bad guys' must all be white, male, confederate (in this case), and preferably christian (if it can somehow be worked into the script). it's sad, really. the best movies out there, are now and have always been about simply telling a good story up on the big screen - not about forwarding someone's political ideology.

completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible movie by mr. boll. how he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community.as a whole i will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts. some of the dialog was even half way decent in far cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly.now besides the fact that jack carver is supposed to be american and not german, til was still entertaining in this role. one exception is the laughably lame lines he uses to get in bed with the girl. and we are supposed to believe that she is ready to have sex with him so casually after such minimal dialog? emile? simply there for comic relief i am sure and still lame. jack's character looks old and tired yet is still capable of the extreme acrobatics needed to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab.don't watch this one for the far cry adaptation. but you might just waste an hour and a half watching it if you have nothing better to do.

this was a disgrace to the game farcry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare. besides the bad acting the visual effects, stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. the movie is not worth watching at all. the funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs. guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time. i hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday. and i they will invest some good cash to get the visual effects right and the scenaries right as well as the acting right. but till then don't waste time by trying to watch this movie because it will surely make you go mad specially if you are a farcry lover.

so im not a big fan of boll's work but then again not many are. i enjoyed his movie postal (maybe im the only one). boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not far cry... this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. these players go by the names of til schweiger, udo kier and ralf moeller.three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. so the tale goes like this, jack carver played by til schweiger (yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. people have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. however, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. we see the evil mad scientist dr. krieger played by udo kier, making genetically-mutated-soldiers or gms as they are called. performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of "spoiler" vancouver for some reason. thats right no palm trees here. instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. we haven't even gone far before i started to cry (mehehe) i cannot go on any more.. if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. until the whole cromed/albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. the movie far cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen.

being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomit!!it was an awful film, though the story was similar to the games plot. the whole super human soldiers thing. other than that jack carver, an all american man in the game, is played by a germen, unless thats some sort of twisted irony, that is what made me pull a middle finger at my tv screen the second it started. the fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer, this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest, whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went "thats a good forest."this is a note to all directors: if you ever plan to make a film based on a game/book play it, understand it and ask fans about it... don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it!!!

i am a huge fan of the farcry game, huge fan. it still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! the story line was new, fresh... a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see doom: the movie, and many more...).the video game begins as the player (jack carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier. jack then finds a communication device where (harlan doyle) guides him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and volcanoes, to find his (lady friend?) (valerie constantine), all the wile battling mutated super soldiers, and genetically enhanced animals.the movie plays out very, very differently: 1: there's a needless 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) of "backstory" before we even get to the 'boat blowing up' scene. 2: jack then walks onto the beach, kills some goons, then drives off... nothing like the game... 3: there is no communicator with doyle on the other end... 4: the 'modified soldiers' look like albinos with singlets on... and there was no mutated 'monkey-like' creatures jumping out of the bushes. a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot... 5: there is no sun filled beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communications stations on huge cliffs, little reference to any in-game contents (characters/items/vehicles), in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. 7: there's an ending scene... where everyone (except krieger) live happily ever after... what the!i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! if you are a gamer, you will hate this movie will all your soul. it is a movie clearly intended for males, so girls, stay away... so if your a male, 12-29 years of age, have never played farcry, and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books/games to the cinema... then this is for you...

i was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the far cry game had been created. the story here is not something i would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. no worries though as in typical boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. now i understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection. not only that but the acting and action sequences are so corny it almost makes you feel like the whole project was one big joke. it has been said a million times before but why couldn't someone more talented pick up the video game rights to create a movie????

barely came trough the whole movie... acting is bad, dialogs are even worse. felt kinda st00pid 4 watching it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so i struggled trough. they even screwed up the sound. at certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud, that i had to turn the volume down. it would be great, if this was a competition about who can screw up more.oh and ps: i don't know what's this guy "uwe" capable of creating... i certainly don't think this movie is bad just because he's the director. i checked the list of his work, and this is his first(and probably the last) creation that i've seen.over&out.

not too good a movie. sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't all that good for a '08 movie. gunshot effects are downright horrible. acting is "meh" it is nothing like far cry, other than names and the very basics of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok). the super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting are completely different (tropical island in the pacific in the game, island in northern-ish america in the movie).i loved playing far cry. i loved the story and setting. i hated the movie.

sadly this film lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. for video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. and not only that, goes well under the mark. far cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film. if you are a gamer that has played far cry; do not watch this film. anyone else who hasn't played the game; it'll still seem like a b grade acted / b grade directed movie. uwe boll, hang your head in shame...this should've been easy to make into a blockbuster. the storyline of the game was incredible (think jurassic park meets alien) and yet you still managed to take it and mould it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic. video game companies be warned - if uwe boll comes a knockin', lock the door. oh & til schweiger...i look forward to seeing you make up for yourself in inglourious basterds. what were you thinking taking this one on? sigh.

clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given uwe boll's track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce.the first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the horrible one-liners delivered by gi joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre.you will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point. you've already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history.next, enter absolute rubbish talent. the leading man has the same amount of charisma that you will find in garden slug.there is an awkward bit of contrived romance thrown in - this feels so wrong that you can only speculate why this scene was conjured up in the first place. normally the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject some humanity and sympathy into otherwise cardboard cut-out characters - here it backfires on all cylinders.the effects are bad and the action unbelievably boring. where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget restraints - here it just seems like everything was spent on catering.there are in fact no redeeming features here - not even the "it's so bad it is almost good" applies. it's just bad, and in a bad way.our hero questions the leading starlet about the night they spent together and how she would rate him. she gives him 2 out of 10. i give the whole affair 1 (i'd have gone for 0 if that were possible).don't waste your time on this dribble, there is plenty of crap cinema out there, which exceeds this ridiculous rumble in the jungle.oh and finally, the movie has little to nothing at all to do with the popular game far cry (at best it is extremely loosely based on it).horrible, move along!

eghads, what a bad movie. tart is perhaps the very worst movie i've seen all year, and i've run across some doozies. there is nothing redeeming about this trash, from the characterization to the direction to the plot. even the usually brilliant dominique swain couldn't save this movie. none of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic, with the possible exception of eloise (wonderfully portrayed by lacey chabert, the only bright spot in this dismal failure).*******possible spoilers********the main problem with tart is that it rambles on without saying anything. it staggers about drunkenly instead of leading us along the path of the story. it also introduces numerous potentially tantalizing details (the hypochondriac brother, the mother's possessions constantly being repossessed, the anti-semitic classmate, the other classmate's murderous father) without successfully exploring a single one of them. and just when i finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end.i left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something, but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. this is an obvious first film from a writer/director who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before foisting any more of her work on an unsuspecting public.i gave this film 1 out of 10, and i'm usually very generous, even with bad films.

basic structure of a story: beginning, middle, end.sometimes this structure is played with, and we get memento or irreversible and the story plays backwards. sometimes it's just not linear, a la pulp fiction. regardless, they all have a beginning, middle and end.this is the first film i have ever seen that doesn't have an end.beginning: girl's best friend is expelled.middle: girl needs to cope without best friend.end: non existent.not that having an end would've saved this film, but at least it would have been complete.it's an exercise in apathy; we get a party-mix of characters, and they all turn out to be duds. boring, vain, vapid and pallid imitations of people.and here's the action within this film: nothing happens. nothing at all happens. mischa barton tries to talk with a plummy english accent, dominique swain whines a lot and brad renfro receives a blow job from some old guy. end of movie.by the time the credits rolled, i had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel: periods of time, those precious minutes of our life, have just been wasted.the only passable point (and that is a very emphatic only) is brad renfro. he acts well. lacey chabert i tend to like, but no luck here. due to good work in other films, i will forgive mischa barton this travesty, but i hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement.please, i implore you. avoid. don't fool yourself into thinking "i'll make up my own mind". my sister told me to never see this, and i ignored her, wanting to make up my own mind. that was a bad decision.i have never hated a film. there are many i don't like, but i have never hated a film. until i saw this.

the beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. it was just one of those movies that i came across in my netflix instant queue and i thought it would be interesting to see brad renfro and bijou phillips team up together again since bully. unfortunately "interesting" never happened in this movie. swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (phillips). but swain likes one of the boys (renfro) from the "in crowd" and eventually starts hanging with them. and, of course, like all other movies things are good (or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good) and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids.the problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. it is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it, you feel you could have done anything better. some scenes (the ones with renfro's parents) don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it, at all.all the interesting things that could have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode (mischa barton and rachel bison from the oc). the only shining light in this movie, and the reason it doesn't get a one rating from me is phillips. they needed more scenes with her in it. renfro just look like he brought over a bit of his character from bully. and, for pete's sake, the title is bs, change the name.

"tart" is a good illustration of old the yogi berra saying: "if you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else". writer/director christina waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 million movie that ends up someplace else. "tart" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.unlike the standard swain film, "tart" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer. good enough to provide two extremely nice shots: the scene of swain and barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of swain in the park-featuring a nice montage of the "alice in wonderland" sculpture. the symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film. it is even possible that waye was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic "metropolitan" and the camp classic "cruel intentions" which also deal with the manhattan upper class. there are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes. the former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations. "tart" seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction. first there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased swain into the garbage chute. then there is the whole bit about her father being jewish (played to the same extreme as joel grey dancing with the jewish guerrilla in "cabaret"). in her other films swain's acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears (insert scenery chewing here) but in "tart" she actually shows an ability to restrain herself. this is the best performance of her career. it also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in "girl" to hulking lumpy-faced in "pumpkin". this transformation was about half-complete by the time she made "tart"; so go the ravages of time. mischa barton ("sixth sense's" i feel better girl) and lacey chabet are excellent in supporting roles. the rest of the cast is simply horrible, although some of the blame for this should go to waye's script and direction.

though i have watched salò, i do not know if excrement tastes tart. if it does, this "film" is accurately titled. so much of roughage, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate. it leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth, and if i could vomit this film and get back that expanse/expense i would. detention was more exciting. the director should be forced to wear a dunce cap, and the spirit of ed wood jr. couldn't save this semi-professional projection from certain failure. a waste of time, a waste of mind. **don't be fooled by the toothsome dominique swain: competent eye-candy she was in the lolita remake, less tragic and savvier than sue lyon, though by no means better. however, a previously competent turn of the screw does not make her a skilled crafts-person. you need craft for that, not crap, which is what this film is. the reels belong in the girls' bathroom, flushed till the pipes burst, while director/direct-less christina wayne should do 5-10 in study hall. watch anything else and pass this class, by (bye), forever!

at least for me. i have been following the career of mr. almdovar since the beginning and i was not crazy about this film. i think penelope cruz was miscast, the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good, she makes the character unbelievable. also, the singing scene was just weird. i do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful.as spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts are the accents. why people coming from the same place have such a different accent? the difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense. and the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? i found myself trying to explain to my american husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", things are not like that anymore.i was expecting more but this time mr.almodovar did not deliver, at least for me. i am not saying that miss cruz does a bad job, i am saying that she does not belong there, not portraying that character.

one of the first things i noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at sole's place. an aerial shot is used to show sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women. i believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureones who stuck together across the generations, separations and misunderstandings, and still being able to bond and rely on each other. also, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. what i mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. an example of this is shortly after paula accidentally killed her father. her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done. again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family, each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has donethat is, killing her husband and his lover. in this light, women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts, but also ones who don't seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends/family members perform.another idea that i thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural. with the death of raimunda and sole's mother and her inexplicable return, the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural. the people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural, that is to say, very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave. their aunt, long-time friend augustina, the prostitute and other people living in the city of la mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the "unfinished business." i believed this was a mixed reflection of the culture's religious faith (predominantly catholic) as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality. the belief they held in regards to the dead being "alive" was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality. when the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn't supernatural at all, it's interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play. she's treated as if she still is a ghost (i.e. hiding in small crevices (underneath the bed or inside a car trunk)). i believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted. the mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-held belief in life after death.

a film by almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time. the capitalized print which opens the spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns, gentle necrophiliacs, wisecracking transsexualsand i haven't even got as far as the infant-terrible's critically reviled early work. and after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera roving across a wind-swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones, i thought pedro had me again under his wicked spell.yet once my nostalgia had subsided, there was very little to fill its place. for a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists, he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women. penelope cruz is raimunda, a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's accidental killing of her abusive husband. thankfully she lives in almodovar's spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails. add to the melting-pot the ghost of raimunda's mother and a host of other eccentrically warm-hearted matriarchs. "volver" means literally to return, and pedro does appear to be recycling old material. the sub-plot of incest feels as though it were tacked-on as the obligatory "taboo". instead of commenting on or subverting the issue, as with his treatment of paedophilia in bad education, it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film's chick-flick sentimentality. i suggest almodovar call his next film salir (to move on).

i've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. it seemed dull to me, much as i enjoyed looking at penelope cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out. it also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. it's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor. utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception. but it's also interesting to notice what happens (and here comes the plot giveaway, though it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and(2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film). it's not quite a glorified killing, though aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way, as though it makes an attractive painting, and then it's soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom, neither materially nor emotionally. later the film reveals another killing, again by a woman of a man, , and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses.in short, volver is an ideologically-driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology, and so i write an ideological critique. but apart from that, it's just not very interesting. it has none of the depth of, say, aldomovar's talk to her, which i loved.

back in 1994 the power rangers had become a huge franchise and t.v. executives at the usa network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the tattooed teenage alien fighters from beverly hills, in which the evil emporer gorganus, who looks like he's wearing a home made darth vader costume, and his talking bird, that looks like a rubber dog chew toy, come to earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970's godzilla film. fortunately nimbar an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth, nimbar gives them each a tattoo of a different star constellation that allows them to transform into buffed up superheros who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video, they could also combined into a giant knight. forty episodes were made. the usa network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from japan like power rangers did, and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950's scifi film. the fights scenes are generic, the special effects are poor, and some of the sets look like they could fall down. the actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and overact. i can only imagine their shock when the show was cancel led.

lucio fulci, a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety, ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in touch of death, a made for tv movie about lester parsons (brett halsey), a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts.starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw, mincing machine and hungry hogs, touch of death starts promisingly enough, but fulci soon loses control of proceedings, introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed 'comedic' scenes. there are several more graphic murders which, in true fulci fashion, are extremely violent and gruesome, but even the high level of bloodletting doesn't stop this from being one of fulci's poorer efforts.as i have found with many of his other movies, a comprehensible storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when lucio is behind the camera. this film has many peculiarities which left me more than little perplexed: why didn't lester dispose all of his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning? why are all of his victims either hairy or disfigured? what the hell is that ending all about?fulci is considered by many to be one of the 'greats' of horror cinema; i don't understand his popularity, finding the majority of the films of his that i have seen so far to be generally lacking both decent narratives and technical proficiency. touch of death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.

there are certain horror directors for whom i've built up so much respect & admiration over the years, that they can't possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film. lucio fulci is surely one of them, but damned, he's trying to disappoint me with his later efforts! you can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films fulci directed or produced during the late 80's and simply watch "cat in the brain" instead, because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than seven other fulci-flicks, including the sickest murders sequences featuring in "when alice broke the mirror". as a whole, this movie definitely ranks among our director's weakest and most pointless achievements. the script is incoherent as hell, the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there's absolutely no suspense to enjoy. i love the title, but it's actually quite meaningless. there is a character named alice in the story, but it's only a supportive role and she certainly doesn't break any mirrors. i suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice, as she's an opera singer, but she doesn't. the plot revolves on a middle-aged and gambling-addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money. lester parson butchers the ladies (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in gruesome ways, makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat. there's also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. the difference between "when alice broke the mirror" and some of fulci's greatest horror films ("the beyond", "city of the living dead", ") lies in the fact that he totally doesn't bother to create a horrific atmosphere. the characters, lester included, are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted; like it's the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car. the lighting is poor, the cinematography super-ugly, the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable. if i didn't know any better, i would think lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it. the obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore & bloodshed, because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn't work properly. as long as lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off women's feet, "when alice broke the mirror" is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment, but other than that, there's isn't a whole lot to recommend.

lucio fulci was famous for his italian splatter movies, mostly his undead films like zombie or the beyond. here he directed a black comedy of sorts, but there's just one problem: its nauseating. i say this knowing that i like city of the walking dead (which is also gross but not like this). a compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash. the film makes this plan look that easy. i guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash on person. after the upteenth murder i began to suspect what i've always heard about fulci: he hated women. he must have. at any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies. avoid this film at all costs.

plot synopsis: los angeles in the future. crime is kept under control by core trackers, android assassins dispatched by the united states computerized judicial system to execute the guilty. secret service agent eric phillips prevents an attack on his boss, senator robert dilly (the man who set up the uscjs), by the union for human rights, a group of anti-machine activists. dilly attempts to initiate phillips into his private circle but the ss agent goes on the run after witnessing dilly murder a uhr agent in cold blood. dilly sends core trackers after him. phillips joins the uhr group & helps them uncover a conspiracy involving dilly."cyber tracker" is the first of a number of sci-fi / action hybrids directed by richard pepin, co-founder of pm entertainment, a powerhouse of action films during the 1990s. other pepin films include "hologram man", "t-force", "the silencers" & "dark breed". pepin films typically start with a major action sequence which lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to kick in. the script for this film has a few plot holes  it is never clear what the conspiracy the heroes are trying to stop actually is. as for the acting, don "the dragon" wilson may be tough but cannot act for beans, with little charisma. his co-stars are a lot better. the film's best bet are the action scenes, which throw up some impressive artillery fire, a huge bodycount & not one but three moments where a vehicle flies through the air, flips & hits the ground, exploding. the visual effects border on the cheap side & the musical score is low-key & shrill.

oh, dear! this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. it's unbelievably repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down, running round screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. i wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good, but it isn't; the main character phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the tracker, he never gets hit, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him. i've rarely seen a worse cast of actors (especially don wilson, if you can even call him an "actor") but that's not really surprising, given the dialogue they have to work with (sample line: "computers killed my brother!"). the plot is a sub-par ripoff of the excellent terminator; the special effects are laughable. overall, this film is just utterly dreadful. and why does everything explode?

this movie was sooo bad. it wasn't even funny at all. not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. oh man, bad, so bad. thumbs down. spoofed, karate kid, teen wolf, footloose, dirty dancing, some kind of wonderful, soul man, and probably another or two. chris kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. he has a jealous girlfriend, who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who chris has eyes for. i thought the acting was really bad. i like laugh out loud comedies, this was not one. "not another teen movie" wasn't funny, but had a lot more funny scenes than totally awesome. "scary movie" is suuuper funny. i always laugh when i watch those, super enjoyable. this movie, not funny.

my wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it. if i ever want to torture her i will make her watch this movie. i've watched many movies with my 4 year old and i can take almost anything. barney is refreshing after a shot of quigley. the plot, dialog, cinematography, & acting were one step above (or equal to) a cheap porn film. i feel cheated out of $3.69 that we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life i will never get back. i will say my 4 year old liked it, luckily it was a rental we had to return right away.i just hope that the younger actor's careers are not ruined from being in this movie.

if you ever plan on renting (hopefully not buying) this movie, think again. it was as if gary busey had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die. i only wonder if busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because i just don't see the guy that acted so much better with keanu reeves in point break play in this disaster. it was a feel-good movie, but there are thousands of other feel-good movies that make you laugh without wanting you to get your money back.the only reason i would ever tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see gary busey jump up and down like a monkey. if you want a good funny movie, pass up quigley and go rent spongebob or something.

while the dog was cute, the film was not. it wasn't the premise, or the theme that was a problem. the premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos both. the theme is a worthy one. helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune.sadly, the adorable dog, the unique premise, and the theme were undercut by poor acting, stilted dialogue, and amateurish filming.even my youngest child who will sit through almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway through. how many times can that dog run up and down the same hallway? i can't spoil it for you, as i never saw the end. it just was not worth watching all the way to the end.

i registered at imdb solely for the purpose of warning others about this movie. hwo does anyone ever get funding for projects like this? that's the mystery. farewell to harry might be the worst movie ever, except that i tried to erase the others that rival this blathering idiocy. bad plot, not-credible logic runs throughout. i can't spoil this movie for you by revealing anything that would make your experience less enjoyable. there is nothing enjoyable about this movie. i have the cd and will send it to you for free, it is that bad. first come, only served. if i know you, this offer is void, because i wouldn't inflict this movie on anyone, not on purpose. you have been warned.

i'm sorry, but this movie is just way to shallow for me. in it, perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend keitel trying to make it as an actress. first of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? even after sitting through this, i still don't know. oh yeah, perez also inspires delorenzo to follow her like a lovesick puppy. there's no reason behind the love, it just kind of happens. there are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your heartstrings, but it rarely works. the only character you really do feel anything for or with is keitel's character, and that's only because he does such a good job with it. any other actor and the character would have been just like the others.the script is basically an uninspired rehashing about how hard it is to make it as an actor/actress. it's been done and said before, the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street pimp. the ending is...well, i don't want to spoil it. let's just say it feels unsatisfying. i'd be more upset if the story was any good to begin with. the directing is average with nothing truly wonderful, but nothing that is really painful to watch either. to reiterate the acting, the only one that does anything worth watching is keitel. though i could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear.oh yeah, eddie bunker shows up. as random as that mention is, that's how random it is in the film. and tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds.

i've never seen the original movie others have commented on, so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison.i found the message of the movie to be,: if you only worry about yourself, all will be right with the world, everything will fall into place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and like you more, your employers will want you more, pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more.i find this message to be reprehensible and totally false.kudos for the very funny birthing scene at the end; there isn't a mother out there who won't laugh during that scene.overall a very disappointing movie plot. i didn't find myself rooting for anyone in this movie. i thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that i just didn't care what happened to them and that's not a movie people want to see.

i saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.that is something that i have not done since - i have never fallen asleep at the movies.i love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. this may have been the problem but i do not think so, because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie work.bette was under used and anne was over used and miscast.i do not know why english or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition.they billed this as a sex in the city but better? not a chance i liked sex in the city a lot and was disappointed by this movie.so do not waste your money on this movie - go see anything but this!

i really wish i had read everyone's review before going to see the movie... it was one of the most excruciating films that i've ever seen. i was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie; i should have followed my instinct. the movie offered nothing new or clever, it was boring and very cliché. i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman! the characters did not represent any women that i know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. the movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. and the actors looked tired, poor make-up and hair styling. it was recently compared to the sex and in the city movie; it was not even half as good. my suggestion, do not see this movie!

to say i was disappointed is an understatement. an amateur film made by professionals. i was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions (something i've never done)i was stopped by cloris leachman really. she rings true, the only one i should say. this new women are less modern than the george cukor women of the 30's. this ones are "acting" for us trying to be with it but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it has always been, in movies anyway. the fun of the original was based on a crisp, vitriolic and very funny script. a masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. all the elements that are missing here. tv actresses mingling with models and oscar nominees/winners. there wasn't anything organic about it. the whole thing felt like a put on, improvised in the moment without a clear objective. 2/10

i haven't seen all cage's works by any means but his acting in this one was truly awful. the other characters run the gamut of ability but, having most of the emotional scenes, cage's scenes are just embarrassing to watch. he's certainly come a long ways in 12 years.

found an old vhs version of this film in my parents house so i thought i'd give it a go. right from the start i wasn't expecting much from this film and i'm glad for that because overall the film was no good.the acting overall was very poor, even for a nicolas cage movie. one scene with a radio controller stands out as being so pitiful that i found it hilarious that this scene wasn't cut. the first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and i didn't know what was going on.the story itself had the possibility of being decent but either the director was just bad or was trying too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the film. i managed to watch the whole thing but i won't likely ever see this film again.

i had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode. it was dumbed down to such an extent, i doubt if i learned a single thing. the graphics were rudimentary. any small idea was repeated ad nauseum. contrast this to the cosmos series hosted by carl sagan. that had a good musical theme. there was no music coming from these infernal 10-dimensional strings.

i'm really disappointed by this piece of work. it is quiet shallow, keeps repeating itself, is mostly not exact and sometimes on the verge of being wrong. i think it's made for elementary school, especially because it keeps repeating itself over and over again while leaving large gaps. a young kid might actually enjoy it and learn from it, but a better way to make a kid appreciate theoretical physics are books like "a short history of time" or "the tao of physics". if you are familiar with the topic on a very basic level, you won't gain any new information or views from this series. don't waste your time with it. nice eye candy though.

i was very disappointed with this series. it had lots of cool graphics and that's about it. the level of detail it went into was minimal, and i always got the feeling the audience was being patronized -- there was a lot of what seemed to me as "this is extremely cool but we're not going to explain it in further detail because you won't get it anyway. let's just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you." the host would drop interesting-sounding words such as "sparticles" and "super-symmetry" without any attempt at explaining what it was. we had to look it up on wikipedia.furthermore, i know quite a bit about superstrings (for a layman) and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better. they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts, but instead, the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject.additionally, i got so sick of the repetitiveness. they could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition. they must have shown the clips of the quantum café about 8 times. the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again. i can't remember how many times he said "the universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings." it's like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting "superstrings are the best thing since sliced bread."finally, the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a "competition" between fermilab and cern, clearly biased towards fermilab. this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics, not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa! i also felt that was part of the patronizing -- "audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested." please. give me a little more credit than that.overall, 2 thumbs down :-(

george and mildred is a truly unfunny film. this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure, as is so often the case.the wit and clever one-liners from the tv shows have gone missing. the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities, which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughs.die-hard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pair's output (mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released), but others should invest their time more wisely.

george & mildred - the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john mortimer who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of george's class war with the fourmiles alive.the plot is cut from standard spin-off cloth - hit-man/mistaken identity - and has as little tension as there are laughs. the producers should have taken a leaf from rising damp, (also 1980)which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise, and kept much of the story in familiar setting.yootha joyce died in 1980 but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work encumbered as she was by her illness. mildred lacks the sharpness of her tv incarnation; cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at georges lack of libido. george's sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets. this is not to say that they were much to shout about. the budget for this movies looks pathetically small; a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi-starched house with some christmas lights adorning the front door.for fans of 70's british comedy or those who just want to revisit an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd.

let me start by saying how much i love the tv series. the nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of poking fun at, but this tv series exploits it better than most. the chemistry between yootha joyce and brian murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time. in my opinion, it is the best british sitcom of the mid to late-1970s, surpassing the likes of rising damp, robin's nest, are you being served? and so on. with the on the buses series having finished a few years earlier, george and mildred became the next pride and joy of itv (or itv 1 as it's now known), enjoying a four-year run on the channel.the movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect. the general essence of the tv series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie (who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series). as one commenter has already pointed out, mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the tv series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing.the plot, instead of focusing on the class war with the fourmiles that was the very foundation of the tv series, actually writes out the fourmiles almost entirely after the first half-hour. the plot, if you can call it that, consists of george and mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters. first rate talent in the form of stratford johns, kenneth cope, david barry and sue bond are all wasted here. most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck (which probably won't be much).the jokes and gags in the movie (if you can call them that) rely heavily upon traditional british farce, including mistaken identities, embarrassing situations, poorly-timed slapstick, characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion. and it all fails miserably. as another commenter has pointed out, it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the tv series and instead crafted out a something resembling a carry on romp. the scene where george is stripped down by sue bond's character is particularly out of context.a mystery surrounding this movie is the bbfc certification provided - 15. just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless, non-vulgar entertainment?not surprisingly the era of sitcom spin-of came to an end not long after this movie was released (shortly after the sad death of yootha joyce). and the company behind this movie, hammer, well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s, soon disappeared into total obscurity.all in all, the movie is a near total washout. my advice - skip this and stick to the tv series. you won't be missing anything, i assure you.

the film was disappointing. i saw it on broadway with bernadette peters and she was outstanding. maybe as she, herself graps on to the end of her musical career, her condtion of desperatation lands her in role that she flaunts, re-invents and triumps as her own. bette's singing is always belted, always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress. to be entertaining, this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast, so that the others would be memorable in bette's absence. another criticism: she smiles directly into the camera every time she start singing! i know it is musical theater, but please leave some grace sociale-- middler cannot perform like liza or streisand might in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.

this is species already hatching into a beautiful model (mathilda may). a smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill!the movie begins with a strong launch, and infected by a bore-virus throughout the middle to end.the weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot/story. as you should have compared it, natasha henstridge's species got the same plot, but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong clymatic ending.this explain why patrick stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in star trek next generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cage, floating inside halley-comet.a must see for a science fiction fans.

this was a crappy, miserably acted movie based on sublimated male fantasies. a shame that it was based in texas, an otherwise excellent state. i would recommend this movie to no-one, and wish that it had never entered my consciousness as i am now so irritated that i wasted my brain cells even paying the slightest attention to it.

this movie was absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the plot could have been made to work, had the movie been written better. the acting was some of the worst i have ever seen. i was very slow and made me want to leave/turn off the movie several times. i watched the entire movie in the hopes that the ending would make it worthwhile but it didn't. this movie i think should be rated in the negative numbers. (in my humble opinion)

so after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the final fantasy series, final fantasy: advent children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. and the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. however, if you haven't played ff7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. of course, for ff7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. one last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed. if you played and enjoyed ff7 than it is a worthwhile watch, though nothing too special. if you have not played ff7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.

i give this movie a 4 cause i'm a die hard fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in cg form sephiroth's still coolnow the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting i've ever seen(i've watched epic movie)the movie just seems cloud orientated so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that. clouds mentioned so much that it make you not want to see him in this movie the villains have the award for the worst villains ever (i was more scared by the wicked witch of the west) all the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie for a nod to the fans and doesn't take it further then thatwtf's with the chilly chally???summary: waited 9 years for this movie and this is what i get a large pointless and boring cut scene i beg the head of square cenix to shoot the man responsible for this burn every copy of the movie and any one involved in it and create a new movie from the ashes's (it would be nice to make the movie in live action and based on the original game)

pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie. and that is precisely what happened here.first off, let me admit, i am yet to play ffvii (i intend to order it soon). however, i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story. however, not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this, and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is required.in spite of incredible visuals, i can't say there is too much thats new. we've seen it in final fantasy: the spirits within, and apart from some better movement, i can't say they've done lots of super-daring stuff with this.the fight scenes - well, they are a bit of fun. still, how could we ever doubt the result of any of them. this one was boringly classic - there were three fights with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, cloud, gets smashed, then he almost gets there and gets smashed, and then finally wins). the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal, but in this case is poorly executed. i'll touch on that later.the english dub seemed fine to me, though i didn't watch it in japanese, so i shan't judge the japanese dub, but only the english one. i'll say this - i've heard plenty of better ones, even in my limited repertoire.and now, the plot. ummm... what plot? let me be frank, this movie is nought but a fan service, a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy. as i said earlier, the fights seem to just happen for no reason. the opening fight is never explained, kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty. cloud sits around moping for the entire film, and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameo.really, ffvii was an ensemble piece. advent children is anything but. if they'd managed to give everyone some significant story role (star trek: first contact proved it was possible, i might add), then this could have been a lot better. naturally, that would have changed the plot too, which, lets be honest, is almost set to be better than the one we got.characters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten. the members of avalanche (thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii, for those who don't know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of vincent valentine, and some get even less). hell, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that is pretty bad.the music... well, i don't care if nobuo uematsu is god himself, he botched this film big time. advent one winged angel was the only decent piece. otherwise, he couldn't decide whether to be epic (and orchestral) or fun (with electric guitar). when he switched from one to the other, you felt it as though he'd taken a sledgehammer to your head.and that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun... it tried to be both, and failed miserably. honestly, you can't please everyone and do everything. the movie also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three is too much), but failed here too. the last scene, which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony, was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it. you don't need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there. that scene just didn't belong in the film (and nor did aerith's frequent appearances - she's dead jim!).given just how fantastic i've heard final fantasy vii to be, this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment. because of the beautiful visuals, i give it a 2 out of 10.

final fantasy: advent children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong. instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, square enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. yes, i said "incomprehensible." did you know that tifa knows blindingly fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? that cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2-ton sword? the english dub is mediocre. while not egregiously bad, it is far from well-produced. the quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub.here is what i'd like to say to the die-hard ffvii fans who can't stop gushing over this movie: advent children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from square enix, but even a trashy cg flick like galerians: rion had a better story. you'll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time. the days of its novelty are numbered.movies like advent children make me question whether square enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. after all (and no offense), it's a japanese company. japanese developers can deliver fun games, but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow. they are utter psychos, however, when it comes to production quality. advent children features some of the most breathtaking renders in cg history, but that doesn't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters.any fan who followed this film knows sephiroth comes back. bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake.note: the one point i give this "film" is in honor of the 10,000 enslaved japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on cloud's effeminate caucasian head.

i was giddy with girlish-glee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits within.after years of anticipation, they gave november 2005 release date. well, november came. and went. followed by december. oh, look, today's january 31, 2006. no us release as of yet.oh well, i'm so glad i had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy. ;dwell, the cg was great. not as good as expected, but near perfect. i cringed, however, at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie. i had thought that we were passed this by now. also, i didn't really care for the anime look given to their faces. i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film, and yet most of the characters have larger-than-norm eyes, especially the girl characters. they had personality, though, i'll give them that.even though i'm not a big fan of anime, i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes. they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seat.for about the first two.and there-in lies advent children's biggest flaw. it's mostly just a bunch of hyper-stylized fight scenes.a ff7 sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years. instead, they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse it's just-under-two-hours running time.where final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this movie falls short. you don't really get to know the characters. the only way you'd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game. we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat.what hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of ff7 characters were given. they were nothing more than cloud's "i'll call if i need you, but i probably won't" back up singers. and, to add to the hurt, they had each character individually throw cloud higher and higher. this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off. i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own, ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higher.it hurt even more when they reduced the turks to less-than-just comic relief. that was fine for the game, but this is cinema. people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle. they took away their dignity :/and, spoiler (yeah right, most of you probably already know, anyhow). who remembers darth maul being hyped up in sw: episode 1? yeah, now, picture that, but with sephiroth. that's right. he had maybe 5 minutes of screen time. maybe that. end spoiler :pif this movie was made for the fans, then way to go square. if this is any indication of the direction you're taking the ff series, i doubt you're going to be seeing much of my money. i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters.you had a chance to make something epic. something truly beautiful, a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg films.instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together. way to go.and i'm sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg they'd know what i'm talking about. well, i was gonna rate this a 5/10, but after thinking about it while righting this, i'm giving it a 3/10 because they could have done better. they have done better. and this is just sad.if they're gonna remake anything ffvii, they need to do this one first.

first i will say that i am going to be as subjective as i can.there will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware.i hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review. this movie final fantasy 7 advent children, based off the ultra popular rpg (final fantasy vii) for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time. after the years of hype and the dozens of trailers (none of which i ever saw, i had only seen stills) this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. i myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself. so i had thought to myself, "what could go wrong?".well, the movie started out ok in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed. without a doubt, this is the best looking cgi animation around, but that won't help a weak plot, undeveloped characters,and over indulgent action scenes. here is the story basically. these three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of sephiroth (he's the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones)are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well, probably to make an army (of kids?) they also center some of the story on some kid named denzel, i don't know who this kid is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. so the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration.so now cloud must save the day from these guys. apparently cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight, i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time. maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible. the real problem of this movie is logic. now i know what you are gonna say, "but it's called final fantasy! it should have those ideas in it!" well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that context. context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, i could explain it all, but if i did, i would end up writing the screenplay.also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite. like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans. they show up, do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story.if this is too long here is the simpler review-the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunningthe cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?) horrible endingbig time spoiler-now the ending of this movie really disappointed me. they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest. then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.not that the movie doesn't have it's moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.other than that it's not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling.

when the spirits within was released, all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like final fantasy. this is a different story, for better or worse. the familiar settings, characters, music, story, and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. the problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right.the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy, switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic, but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing.the cg itself is exceptional, but i can't say it's the best i've ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters, although i must admit that advent children's characters moved much more naturally.the plot is virtually a black hole. it's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring sephiroth back for one last fight. old characters reappear, but serve no real purpose other than to please fans. character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end. but it's packed with neat-looking fight scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans wanted anyway.in the end, advent children is a very flashy, but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy vii than a real sequel.by the way, don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting not useful. it just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys/fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly.

i really like kinski he is a great actor. i've seen this movie because i've heard that there are autobiographic aspects in this movie.the film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow-pictures at the walls. then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: "a kid sells fortune, but her box is empty now." this is really disturbing and wasn't really necessary, because everyone understands what this movie is all about. the movie shows how kinski's character treated woman, and how he kept them under control. if there are really some aspects of kinski's life in this story - then he really was an swine. so there is no need to watch this movie, unless if you want to see kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies to laugh about.

this film is sometimes called 'the story of o-pt.2',which tries to pass itself off as a sequel (of sorts)to the french erotic s&m thriller 'the story of o'. although i've never seen the original version, i did, however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual & social politics. i guess the 'o' angle comes from the occasional s&m overtones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to watch) as the ones in 'mistress'. klaus kinski is the only recognizable face in this french/japanese production (but speaks his lines in english--at least in the version i saw). the unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious (what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water?). it's obvious that after the whole "porno chic" trend in cinema petered out (ouch-sorry,bad pun!)about 1975, producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema,not to mention foreign/art cinema,so film goers had to contend with dreck like 'the last woman',and others like it.

i bought this film on dvd despite the "stale" review and that was idiotic... that review was completely accurate and i have never seen any worse "erotic" film in my long life! even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings, plus a nice cover... but my own extreme erotica (c) films are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times of this films budget! the story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book... or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments... then did the main male character - klaus kinski - not look a bit like the second master of "o" he try to play... and not even lovely arielle dombasle, did look delicious in any scene!

this is one of the worst films i have seen in a while.the problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film, 'artistic' or an exercise is eroticism. as a result it fails on all accounts.the acting is atrocious, the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointless.klaus kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing. sure he has an intense and 'unique' look but ultimately he can't actually act. just look at how he reacts when his mistress leaves....really don't watch this film, some say it needs repeat viewings i say one is too many.

this movie tries to be artistic but comes across as puerile as a film school student's first attempt. next it tries to be erotic but comes across as clumsy as a virgin's first attempt. lastly it tries to be cruel & gripping, but aside from kinski's performance--which is powerful but conspicuously misplaced amidst the amateur melodrama--it's about as gripping as your hand around a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering how un-erotic this film is). it features a blowjob scene which is even lamer than chloë sevigny's career-burying performance in the brown bunny. run away now while you have the chance. go find yourself a victoria's secret lingerie catalogue instead--it's more artistic and more erotic than this tripe.

the premise of this movie is ugghhhh. the guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "yeah, this is funny, cute, and a good movie." what the hell?!?! what is funny about immature girls fornicating with a married man with a new baby? what is cute about the fact that he is cheating on his wife? what have been wrong with them finding some teenage boys to have sex with before starting college? noooo, that is not good enough, the guy has to be married, off-limits, off-the-market, that's the one we gotta have. dumb-ass girls! then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the guy. no, she just "loves" the way he makes her feel. two of the girls are having fun with it, they think it is funny and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they are doing. it just shameless, but yeah this is all good with everyone one this website. the dark-haired girl even has the audacity to have her dad pick her up from the guys house, under the ruse of baby sitting. this is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife? poor woman working and paying the bills while he screws the baby sitter.

this movie is worse than "heaven's gate" or "plan 9 from outer space". don't know why it got even one oscar, it should have gotten a million raspberries, just like the audiences that either walked out or didn't show up in the first place. the hospital was a first-rate financial failure, but i'm certain the elite classes of left-wing, gutter-mouthed intellectuals railed that the american public was far- too plebeian to appreciate biting social-commentary when they saw it, and on and on. george c scott, in one of most-artless and embarrassing roles, along with aging sex-symbol diana rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasingly-blasé manner as they push along a silly plot. poor old george is impotent and is just crushed by the event, but after lots of dirty language between him and rigg, he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy, crumbling nyc hospital that looks so disgusting that i wouldn't want a dying pet rat treated in it. there's also some sacrilegious junk-dialog tossed about hither and yon, laced with plenty of cussing as well. it ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest. never want to see another minute of this awful movie again.

i'm amazed that "the hospital" has been so well-received by the critics and the public. i found it dreary, visually ugly and generally meaningless. after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes, the film does improve (relatively), but it remains way too far-fetched (not to mention unfunny) to be successful as a satire, and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. the film's uncertain tone is its biggest fault, overshadowing even scott's terrific (as usual) performance.

i have to ask myself, do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and critiquing it? how can something so awful score this high? my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids, anything with an r in it until we were old enough. i only remember two films that had them saying yech! when they got home. this one, and "catch-22".the movie is comprised of bumbling physicians and staff in a filthy hospital, rambling narratives, and a pack of inner city people (who look like rejects from a 1970s norman lear sitcom) staging a protest. the worst part is the "murder mystery", a crazy old guy doing "god's work" by killing doctors and others. when he confesses, scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. they only care about him getting out of there where he will "be safe and happy". a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is faked as the man so he can get away. oh, my, what a fun movie.this movie didn't "make me think", chuckle, or have any other feeling other than "it must get better", but it never does. people wonder why it was a failure, no wonder here. i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good. yech.

cowardly and cynical, `the hospital' represents the nadir of paddy chayefsky's special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire.thanks to ham-handed director arthur hiller, this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly, poorly paced presentation it deserves.only a great performance by george c. scott, in the sort of mean-spirited role he was born to play, keeps `the hospital' from being a complete disaster.ironically, though, scott's performance does viewers a disservice. his magnetism keeps them watching when they might more profitably turn off the vcr and clean out the closets, stare at the clouds, or watch re-runs of `baywatch.'certainly, anyone who emotionally invests in the set-up _ modern medicine apparently gone amok _ will feel cheated by the dismal payoff, where chayefsky reveals that the system works just fine, so quit your carping.while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy, it all turns out to be a red herring. before that becomes clear, though, chayefsky gives some good lines to scott as his middle-aged, middle-class, white male stand-in.bitter, alcoholic, impotent, scott's dr. herbert bock has alienated those who know him best, and he has the bile to keep alienating them. in chayefsky's worldview, all that of course makes bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his age.playing a collection of adjectives, the long-haired, long-legged, braless and almost bust-less diana rigg struggles in the part of `the girl.' the british rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress would struggle as well. like the rest of a good cast gone to waste, rigg can't overcome a script that isn't interested in any character except bock, or any philosophy beyond banality.for fans of george c. scott, this is another star turn and worth watching. for fans of black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. for anyone else, don't bother.

it's okay ... a few years later chayefsky's classic "network" will be his true cinematic big home run ..., but for now, this dark comedy isn't the classic it aspires to be. it's mostly awful, although it has some good scenes: the first murder victim being found, the e.r. clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery, drummond's delusional confessional, and the very last scene where scott's character regains his professional integrity and self-respect. it also has some ludicrous scenes: scott's character's whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist, scott's character's raping rigg's character, dysart's horrible mugging in his brief scenes, and the o.r. doctor pouncing on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because "i already have one malpractice lawsuit".chayefsky also tries too hard throwing every conceivable hurdle at this one hospital (i.e.- the murders, the administrative mistakes, the poor people protesting outside, etc). it might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole. acting-wise: scott is passable, rigg seems miscast, hughes is inspired, and dysart mugs through out his brief performance. the rest of the cast is too one-dimensional.

i just saw this stinky old boiler on tv. best watched with a very large flagon of dr jurd's jungle juice at hand, this exploitorific cheese-fest is hilariously bad. on the (very slim) plus side, raquel was in her physical prime, she looks good, and you get to see a fair bit of her, since she plays a go-go dancer; she had great legs, that's for sure. there's also some minor interest for screen buffs in the footage of los angeles ca. '69, and in spotting actors in minor parts who went on to better things. veteran thesp ron rifkin ('brothers and sisters') delivers a toe-curling early performances as "sailor" the "faggot junkie" barman who rats raquel out to the bad guy. you might also recognise the gun-toting security guard in the hit-and-run scene -- it's a very early appearance by gordon jump, who gave such a lovely performance in 'soap' as piece of chelief tinkler.the 'plot' of 'flareup', such as it is, follows the travails of an exotic dancer (welch) on the run from her murderous ex-husband (luke askew). this turkey is classic production-line hollywood sludge -- a paint-by-numbers script, pedestrian direction, hokey shots, edits and effects, ultra-cheesy stock music, plywood sets, and performances to match.the cast is as uniformly dreadful as the screenplay. although raquel is capable of fair performances in the right vehicle, this wheezy old clunker is so bad that she doesn't really stand a chance, and neither does the audience. one of my favourite moments occurs when raquel awakes up in the hospital, sees the vegas cop who's pursuing her murderous ex, and asks "how did you get here?" -- to which he of course replies "in a plane." oh the humanity ... and you won't be able to take your eyes off the doctor (michael rougas) who has what might well be one of the very worst walk-ons in the long sad history of bad cameos. i don't think i've ever seen anyone stand in one spot so badly before.raquel's love interest joe (james stacy) ambles through the film with a fixed look that's somewhere between bemused and embarrassed -- and no wonder. this bomb puts the cast through just about every made-for-tv cliché in the book, from raquel's spectacularly dreadful turn in the dreadful nightmare montage, to the pure schlock of the 'romantic' horse ride along leo carillo beach.**spoiler warning** -- just about the only interesting thing in the whole film is the denouement, in which raquel finally gets her own back, and hilariously enacts the title, by setting the baddie on fire. whoever the stunt guy was really earned his money on this one -- he goes up like yorba linda in a heatwave. yet even this fairly spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew moves into shot near the end.there are so many crappy things about 'flareup' that it's oddly compelling; i found yourself wondering if this could be one of the worst films i've ever seen made. the answer seemed to be a resounding 'yes' ... until i saw the film that followed it, roger corman's mega-trashy 'caged heat' classic 'the big doll house', which takes awful to a whole new level. i can heartily recommend these two shlockers as a double-bill. you'll laugh yourself silly.

after nearly getting killed by a big dog, a stray cat thinks to herself, "why can't i be a skunk? then everyone would leave me alone." she looks around the junkyard and gets an idea: white paint, black paint and some limburger cheese and some garlic......hmmmm. the next thing you know, we have the forerunner to "pepe le pew," although in this cartoon, she's still a cat, she's a she, and just a skunk in disguise. the cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a smelly skunk. he's a happy, content guy now.....until a real skunk (with the charles boyer imitation voice) shows up! i did appreciate the cat putting on a bugs bunny outfit. however, overall i never cared for these french-takeoff characters, finding the stereotypical dialog overdone and not really funny, so i only rate this as "fair." i do this a point, however, for the moral at the end of the story.

chuck jones's 'odor-able kitty' is the cartoon that introduced pepe le pew to the world sort of. there are a few key differences between the pepe we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. for one, the disguised cat who pepe amorously pursues in 'odor-able kitty' is distinctly male. also, pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is henry at the cartoon's climax, his french accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the put-upon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. for the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a pepe le pew cartoon but pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. he is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. in fact, 'odor-able kitty' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every pepe le pew cartoon that followed. this subsequent development has robbed 'odor-able kitty' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull pepe le pew short with a weird surprise ending. as a child, i hated pepe le pew. as an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqué humour, i love the character and most of his cartoons. 'odor-able kitty' makes me feel like a child again!

my guess is that the producers of this low-budget space/horror film wanted a serious movie but the director had his heart set on a parody. so...this is what we get. set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and peopled with characters and props right out of the 90's. the set is some industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker, whatever. they use is as is so the controls consist racks of old tv equipment. one location is obviously the employees lunchroom and sports an old tv and vcr as well as a water cooler with plastic demijohn. tiny lister and coolio get the best lines, arguing throughout the story. the dialog is packed with terms that are pretty dated even now ("a-ok, daddy-o") but then maybe the 30th century is very retro? when the captain declares the ships cargo is a load of coffins from "the transylvania station" you know this is all a put-on. its a bit of alien, part jasonx, shameless rip-off of all the best sci-fi and horror titles. at one point casper vandien even tells his pilot to "make it so" with a straight face. this film would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire but they keep attempting to make the story serious....maybe the backers were on the set that day. anyway, not a bad boredom killer if you aren't too picky. fx are as good as the sets are bad.

i normally like casper in his movies, a real credit to starship troopers. but the box cover on this video ssooooo mi-sleds the renters. at my local video, people rent it expecting a (perhaps) borg like vampire, and instead they get a bad re-make of lon chaney. it had great potential, and fell very flat. ireally think i could have written a better story line and screen play. why is it in every science fiction movie, they (the cast) constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy? didn't any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class? it is a pet pevee of mine, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a whole bunch of solar systems. it is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs. makes it sound even dumber.

this was on scifi this past weekend, and i had to check it out. after all... it was science fiction, with vampires and erika eleniak. what could go wrong with this b-movie?a lot.to start with: it can't even be classified as a "b-movie," because that would put it in the same league as roger corman... and this movie doesn't even meet his expectations. the most money they spent was on the contact lenses for the vampires.secondly: the casting was horrible. yes, casting udo kier as the captain of the demeter was a smart move... but the director clearly couldn't even get kier to memorize his lines. casting eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a smart move because it means a bunch of horny guys are going to buy/rent/record this flick to watch her get seduced by a vampire. but, the director, writer and producer screwed that one, too. granted, they got some money out of the poor, unfortuate souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with hot women in them... but no one is going to remember this movie in another two or three years.thirdly: little things that just emphasize the laziness in this movie. for example, van helsing calls a cross a "crucifix," and, when mina is staked in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see the fact that her "chest" is nothing more than pillows.oh, and one other thing: why did they go for the george hamiltion-type dracula instead of something that would look decently scary? does george hamilton have an overwhelming hold on our future? why didn't everyone who saw dracula just laugh at him for his get-up?a waste of time. even with a tivo remote in your hand.

this is my first comment on a movie in here. i have to say that of all the bad films i ever seen, including braindead for an example, this is really worse! i promise. don't even look at it. it is boring, bad acting, bad script and plot, bad effects the whole movie is one big piece of crap! if i could i would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest is 1 which is awful, i need to vote that. but i would say the movie is worse than awful.don't pain yourself by seeing this movie and hoping it will get better because i can tell you already now, it wont! i hoped that there might would come one single scene which would be worth watching. there didn't came any good scene at all. what an excellent piece of crap. and coolio as a vampire? lol! lmao! yargh!

ok with coolio in it i should have known better! but noooooooo.within 3 mins you've encountered 5 bites from other movies & and tv shows...8 mins casper van dien should have learnt by now! 10 mins you're feeling sorry for tom 'tiny' lister jr. that he has been reduced to doing movies like this.15 mins erika eleniak shows up looking like zena.20 mins you're ready to shoot you're self...how these movies receive funding is beyond me! and yes i watched the whole thing. the ending is priceless!!! just stay away!

when you make a film with a killer-kids premise, there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible, creating believable characters and situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something which the makers of "silent night, deadly night" did, for example, on an equally controversial subject: a killer santa). the people who made "bloody birthday", however, do neither of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun (or a knife, or a noose, or an arrow) in his/her hand. the result is both offensive and stupid. the whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years). it's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids, but it's very sloppily made. (*1/2)

actually i feel like having my review be that one word. my friend, whose opinions i almost always trust about movies, especially horror movies, warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was, because it was a complete waste of time. unfortunately i haven't talked to him in a while, and i was in a hurry to pick a movie, and thought, 'what the heck, how bad could it be?' why don't i learn? what was i thinking? did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rented?the 'plot' concerns a guy who edits films for some company. his boss is a jerk. the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the pre-credits sequence, so for some reason the boss picks nerdy 'ed' for the special project of editing "loose limbs" splatter movies. he never says what ed is supposed to edit, but i guess that doesn't matter. ed is upset by some of the clips, working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason. he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't care. he starts to slowly go insane, supposedly from watching the clips, and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life. or has he been this way all along? please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep, interesting, and coherent than it actually is.we don't care about the characters at all, or have any sympathy for them, or even hate the bad guys. the plot is really, really boring and predictable. the splatter isn't even that gruesome or creative-this is not worth renting just to see the gore, because what there is isn't interesting or original.all the 'tributes' to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs, and no-one in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell, so you can't distract yourself with that. i think an "evil dead ii-dead by dawn" poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action. a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay. every time i hear lines like "are we having fun...yet?" (which even bride of re-animator couldn't pull off without making me wince) i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself. characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation, wandering in only to get killed. this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining, but it was all i could do to keep from fast-forwarding through most of it. fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing. trust me, it did not require my full attention-i still felt like 90+ minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the background.don't watch it, no matter how tempted you are-you'll hate yourself for wasting your money. horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is. even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away, as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while. if you want something brainless, low-budget and fun, rent something else. complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. be smarter than i was at the time and don't be fooled by the "warning-not for the faint of heart" on the box. you have been warned!

this flick is terrible! it sets out to disgust and make you laugh, but it fails horribly. the director obviously has no sense of slap stick gore comedy, and the actors are like nothing i've ever seen - lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy. even their attempt at the english languish is really sad, and actually the down right peculiar swedish accent, in which the incoherent dialog is spoken, is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film. even the gore i awful and unconvincing. if you crave gore comedy, i'd suggest you turn to classic fare such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you must. we all enjoy a bloody good laugh, but this is ridiculous!

a swedish splatter movie? has the world gone insane?probably not, but it's still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore-flicks, the b-movie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days, long gone are the golden days of "rymdinvasion i lappland". and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own: it's just too much talk in it, it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx, which are great for a b-movie. the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though, but that actually don't matter that much, it's supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more, that's where it goes a bit wrong for some reason. there's is simply not enough blood to fill the void. every person who know about gert fylking will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt. though. i nearly laughed my ass off. it's really that hilariously bad. besides the good parts i've listed there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're starved for swedish b-movies.4/10

when people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said little. these children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film). lets start with the blonde - debbie - she's a slut of a girl, i mean come on she wears mini skirts, she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face. she acts so innocent. next we have the second child - the geek - who thinks he's so cool, with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile. the next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him. this film angered me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them.

if you see the title "2069 a sex odyssey" in the video store, beware!! the cover has tori wells and three other "80's" porn stars, and has a copyright of 1986. if you're like me (and i hope you're not) you'll think "80's porn? tori wells? alright!" trickery!! it was made in 1974 and has dubbed german stars! there's nothing inherently wrong with 70's german porn, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you're getting. once i got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket, i watched it anyway. it's a bad, bad movie. sorry, i guess i didn't really get past the rage.

four guys (jacks) go into the restaurant business with a fifth guy and lose all common sense. they allow themselves to be abused worse than textile workers at the turn of the century without simply leaving the situation. this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen. i just hope i can resell this item to someone who might like it. it is true that it holds your attention if you can let the illogical plot developments not bother you too much. it is very silly throughout however especially once a stranger enters the restaurant. who is he? guess.

on paper this movie has some chops: a street kid overcoming past trauma, rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written him off. great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending.in the theater though, there were some omissions that left the movie dead inside. the dialog was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did everyone need to be gay? i have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie but when it's used in this fashion not only is is offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes the lifestyle and cheapens the movie. if the story works without this cheap trick it should have been cut.every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form: each had one major flaw and one minor flaw, every character is good hearted were they succeed or not, and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone.the most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get over that the name "pip" comes from great expectations. they give it to you once and that should be enough. the story shares enough with the dickens classic to make this fact obvious.the most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves for pip and how pip, the main character, learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape. in the end, with lessons learned, pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life.

though not a complete waste of time, 'eighteen' really wasn't all sweet as it pretended to be. nor are the ages of the actors they're portraying  18, my butt. mckellen could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was 30 and ask us to believe it. even michael j. fox was more believable as a teen in 'back to the future' parts ii and iii (okay, maybe not; they're probably equal believability.) if you can get past the obvious age flaw, you'll have either the complete void of acting or simply overacting (paul anthony's so called anguish, clarence sponagle's lifetime moments, and even though i do favor brendan fletcher, it's best to just watch him, and more, in 'freddy vs. jason,') incomprehensible scenes (a faster than britney spears marriage, incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate, but still has one hand free  i'm guessing this was the writer's fantasy,) an entire movie of despicable characters (anthony might be playing someone that's 18, but acts like he's 12 and some odd "john" thrown in so anthony's character pip can save the day  was there really a sex scene in front of a baby?) and practically every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actions/scenes. on the positive side, i did enjoy ian mckellen's voice-over, seeing a (rarely well portrayed) straight/gay friendship, puppy love (from someone who collects stuffed puppies, that is,) good score, some decent dialogue (love the separation of gays and pedophilia  wish more people would realize that) and acting from the female leads (as well as cumming.) i can't really recommend it as it's really trying to be too many things  gay tolerance, gay hustling, homelessness, wwii epic, priesthood, first love, flawed judges, etc, etc, etc  on a shoestring budget.

how better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on tv? and i don't mean in the show cops; here, they're actually being presented as protagonists.i don't see any remedial value in this show unless you have a perverse penchant for human tragedies. whitney houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star which bobby brown helped pull from the sky. bobby brown is nothing but a low-life criminal. why watch him? why does whitney stand by him no matter how despicable he is? this couple should be locked up and it's a loathsome shame they are making money and achieving a modicum of fame from watching the septic tank which is their lives and the human waste which is their character.

a good idea let down by heavy-handed production.quite a bit of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the level of music/background sound, and this didn't help this reviewer. nor did the welsh accents, pretty impenetrable at times. towards the end i lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue.this movie didn't know whether to be a farce or a black comedy - and they require different approaches. some of the incidents were laid on so thick that they only merited a groan, some were so unbelievable even for this sort of plot that they made the story just not worth following.the acting was in the main good - although the american just came over as a clone of the "back to the future" mad scientist. the little boy was very good.i did watch it all the way through but god knows why: i can't remember laughing once.

'bloody birthday' is an odd and, at times, humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'the good son'.set in a small californian town, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions. ten years later, our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree, doing away with parents, siblings, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go!for a slasher film, it's very tame in terms of violence and gore, which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to. instead, it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. the main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth.'bloody birthday' is rather mediocre as a horror flick, with few scares and little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers, it is a bit unique in that way. one to watch if there's nothing else on.

is it a poorly acted, cliche-ridden pile of trash? of course. anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place. thus, i will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10:violence and gore: 4 -- for this genre, there are very few deaths, and the gore is almost non-existent. anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. the only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things, which raises the bar a little.suspense: 1 -- okay, i feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids.nudity/sex: 7 -- lots of boobage from three different women, one of whom is the mtv vj julie brown. there are two sex scenes, but little is shown in them.unintentional humor -- 4 -- there are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary, but all in all, it's just bad, not funny bad.overall -- 4 -- it's not unwatchable. there are a few fun moments, and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie. however, only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks. this definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it's not all the way at the bottom. the real downside is the disappointing ending. it almost ruined the movie for me.

i thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including peter o'toole, susannah york, michael craig & harry andrews might be worth watching. alas, i was wrong. utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly. i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. i've a feeling o'toole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (york). he is also barking mad. but apart from that, your guess is as good as mine.the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. risible.

forget the fact that most people expect an action movie form seagal. this movie simply had no substance. very long, drawn out, and boring. scenes were much longer than they had to be - the camera would often focus on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening. cure for insomnia. worst seagal movie by far (i do like some of his other movies). 1/10

[possible spoiler alert]it's unlikely that seagal will ever again scale the heights of lousitude he did with *on deadly ground* (mainly because no one's ever going to let him direct again), but he sure tries, don't he?this one's a typically brainless and badly-written little fantasy about how indian folk remedies are much more effective than western medicine. seagal seems to actually believe this nonsense, although he never explains why life expectancy in the americas and europe is so much higher than it was in 1492.kinda like he never explains how his supposed "water-fueled engines" work in *on deadly ground*.even the "action" in this one sucks.

you get a good portion of steven seagal environmental anxieties, and some breathless mountain views along with cow-boy scenes (or alternatively use parts of any remains of the horse whisperer). you then add a large piece of outbreak virus or similar (attention it must be more lethal and at least biohazard level 4) wrapped around a fat militia group leader. you add one teaspoon of martial arts, and a zip of explosions and gunfire for the taste. add the classic red indian herbs for the extra taste. serve immediately.what is the name of the film you get ?: the patriot. perhaps the worst film of steven seagal. i am sure that seagal tried to say something in this film except the usual i-am-a-cook (but-also-an-ex-seal) but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful.

this is a known fact, mr. seagal cannot smile, he can act, he can kick butt, there are faint smiles, no real smiles no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie. we see an over weight mr. seagal as dr. wesley maclaren, who is in desperate need of a haircut and his real daughter ayako made an appearance as his office assistant. story: okay so wesley lives in another darn outback with his sweet daughter holly. they sit and enjoy their red flower tea and omelettes and on the other end of town some over weight militia leader decides to make the whole town sick by spreading a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he can survive as he had an antidote. problem, there is no antidote and the one that exists only holds back the virus for a while. the cia are contacted and even they can't help and only one person isn't ill, wesley's daughter holly. so she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood. wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather, who is a native indian. together with his sister in law ann they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and so will others if they don't find a cure in time. and to shorten the moment, neither ann or wesley are infected by the virus...hmm. one weak fight scene. terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a stair master.

steven seagal's intent is to be commended, and his acting in this film is equal to that in many of his others, if you ignore the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist. the problem i had was with two items of the plot, which stretched my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point.first, how is it that a carefully engineered variation on a nasty germ, whose antidote must be just as carefully researched and engineered by a big lab, is cured by drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains? and that grandpa's family seem to be about the only people who know anything about this?second, and this one really takes the cake: having gathered up enough of the cure to fix a whole town, wouldn't you expect the army to land the helicopter and start rushing bags of flowers to all the homes in this small town? no, they instead decide to sprinkle the flowers all over the town and force the sick people to go out and gather them up all over again. just plain silly, unless under native belief the power in the drug somehow depends on one's having gone out and gathered the flowers oneself.add in the cardboard nature of the villains and the unsuitability of the title, and you might think my vote on this movie is actually high.

where should i begin with this movie. all i know is that it is a mess. be the script, story, or the actors. first of all, this movie is very disappointing from salman khan who gave us a fun dulhan hum le jayenge and har dil jo pyar karega before this. second rani is getting really annoying, appearing in every stupid movie since kuch kuch hota hai (glad saathiya stopped this nonsense). the story is stolen from the wedding singer, but ruins the funny movie. the dialogues are lacking. i may have laughed here and there, but entertained? no!!! salman khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies, but here he is insane. his character is poorly written. one minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor. rani mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasn't putting any effort. she luckily redeemed her career with saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time. pooja batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough. jackie shroff is wasted. kashmira shah's beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script. raveena tandon looks beautiful, but puts little performance. mohnish behl gets the award for worst (supporting) actor (they need razzie's because there have been terrible movies in india). he says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks weird, and is not in his regular form. just to tell you, there is more to the cast who are also terrible. if it weren't for raveena's awesome beauty in aa meri life bana de, i wouldn't give the movie a point. otherwise the dancing by salman was terrible. pooja batra was dancing like a wind in savariya, otherwise i wish the costumes were given a make-over and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dancing) had been blown away from the wind. the good song of the album was o priya o priya which doesn't have a good enough picturization. same goes for the half way decent title song. otherwise this movie (and the rest of the songs) are a no-no for everyone.

formulaic slasher film, only this one stars three ten year olds (all born during a lunar eclipse) as the killers. nice, huh? a little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre, others beware.*1/2 out of ****

k murli mohan rao made the much better bandhan in 1998 this film is an awful remake of the wedding singerbasically in short, the film consists of: salman khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenesjackie shroff- wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid he is shown as a lover of pooja bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer?inder kumar- confusing characterization againrani mukherjee- boring, overweight and does nothing special pooja bhatra- tall, fair and actress worthy but lacks talentkashmira shah- says a dial as if a poetrymohinish behl- poor fellow the 2 kids were awful toothe story is the same and has awful comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of shakti kapoordirection is poor music is decentsalman khan just goes through the motions, jackie is bad, rani is as usual, pooja is bad, mohinish and kashmira are nothing great inder is awful

when i read the reviews of kahin pyaar na ho jaaye, i thought, "huh?". it was that confusing. to be sure, i went to watch the film and what do you know? it's a remake of "the wedding singer". several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of indianness, but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 hollywood hit. bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it. i groaned so much watching this and i realized i wasn't the only one doing so! one guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! salman khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. he shrieks and whines too much. why can't he just take it easy? he doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by adam sandler. he doesn't have sandler's sense of comic timing. rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she's no drew barrymore either. the scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname ("hi, i'm mrs pugalia") doesn't match up to barrymore's version ("hi, i'm mrs julia gulia"). i felt embarrassed watching that scene, even though i had loved the original. the music is not too bad. it's probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film! avoid this at all cost!

there are no - no redeeming qualities to this film. they didn't check a single fact - not one about... anything. i feel sorry for larry miller, and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venue.the adults are all idiotic. the effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality. the music is honestly cheesy. the plot is beyond belief.i you want to see something good with your family, see anything else. take some time and check for mildew in your attic. my ten-year-old is mocking this film as we watch it. he's unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching.

every james bond movie has its own set of rules. just like every indiana jones movie has its own set of rules. and the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. with a completely unnecessary plot twist, the integrity of both ocean films plummets somewhere between airplane 2 and a roadrunner cartoon.imagine what would happen, while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the temple of doom, if indy told shorty and willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.entertaining? sure, for a roadrunner cartoon. but spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. more importantly, it would have angered the audience. they'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of indiana jones movies and they were counting on indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. if he were to fly off? people would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during ocean's 12.spoilers1. julia roberts'character, tess, infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as...julia roberts?!? a clever twist? by breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters? is this the naked gun 33 and 1/3? it's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film. but wait...just in case you haven't walked out yet...2. the suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie -- how will they pull off the heist -- there are only 10...8...5...2 days left! and then in the last 12 minutes of the film, the only entertaining part of this movie, we see that the heist was made days earlier and took matt damon all of 30 seconds to pull off. the past 10 days? a complete waste of your time.back to indiana jones on the rope bridge..."just relax, willie! i stole the real stones back about a month ago! besides, i convinced them you were kate capshaw!"if you haven't already seen it, cut your losses and go see the polar express. i don't want to ruin the ending for you, but there really is a santa claus. most importantly, you won't feel cheated leaving the theater.

i had very high hopes walking into this movie. after all, ocean's 11 was a truly great hollywood product. its rapid-fire jokes, incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films i have ever seen. of course, with all the money it made, a sequel was on the way, and i, for one, was excited.needless to say, i was absolutely blown away by this movie. blown away by how horribly wrong things can go. this movie had everything going for it; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news stories of crazy on- and off-set antics. how could it possibly have gone so wrong?it starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. after reasonably goofy short scenes between pitt/zeta-jones and clooney/roberts, the film spends several minutes watching andy garcia waltz from scene to scene, telling each individual member of danny ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. believe me when i say that these scenes are only here to pad andy garcia's running time, because without these ridiculously awkward shots, his screen time would be well under five minutes.this leads me to another major qualm i had with this film. the pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story, and only sometimes brought back later. bernie mac's character is dropped from the script early on, and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. garcia appears for the first few minutes, and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning, and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20-25 minutes left. even clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison.this would all be excusable if the film was funny. at all. 90% of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best. the "plot" is undeniably worthless, and left me feeling cheated. at one point in the film, the team takes on a job worth $2.5 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before garcia's two-week deadline. several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is, but they do it anyway! over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. furthermore, the equipment they use to pull this job off clearly cost millions upon millions to fund. just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $2.5 million to pull off. obviously, because of this, they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. the beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. here, they pull so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.we all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. thus is the nature of the caper film. the twist at the end of ocean's twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because i couldn't believe how cheated i felt. i won't give it away, because i know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.what i will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.i was excited to see this film, after absolutely adoring ocean's 11. i left the theater feeling like i had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. i have never given a 1 to a movie on imdb.com, but there's a first time for everything. consider yourselves warned....1/10

i like cky and viva la bam, so i couldn't resist this when i saw it for £1.99 in gamestation. it is bam magera's debut scripted film, penned by himself and brandon dicimaillo, and stars the entire cky crew (ryan dunn, raab himself, rake yohn, jenn rivell, don vito etc etc). brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits - its quite ckyish in its colour style - but also shows progression.basically it follows (very loosely) ryan dunn's break up with girlfriend glauren (played by jenn). vilo (played by bam, named after vilo valo by any chance?) and falcone (bran) play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts.its a bit like the cky films but with a linear storyline (which is very basic indeed) and poor acting. its strange, the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next.the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part, but the second half of the film is much better than the first (90 mins is a stretch for the flick though), and there are a number of redeeming factors, such as tony hawk's cameo, dicimaillo's sub plots such as 'the futurstic invention awards' and 'the diamond bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (its not all cky and him - in fact bomfunk mc's steal the film in terms of its use of music). in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real - especially since don vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part - and he seems to steal every scene he is in.the film will appeal to those who like the cky antics, but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit. oh, and will someone tell bam that skating montages, especially in films, is sooo 1998.however, the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film - but the 40 mins 'making of' doc.the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with raab himself's alcholism and the crew's real feelings towards each other amazing candidly (as usual bam comes across as a bit of a dick, especially towards raab's drink problem and ryan dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy). the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend (who is an infrequent cky member) trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary side of gang (espcially ape and ryan) really comes across - a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvd.for £1.99 i'm very satisified - although i hope bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on.

i thought it was comedy!! what a hoot! i can't believe forsythe or reynolds would actually appear in this piece of trash..and then there's the beautiful erika eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is called..appears she put on a few pounds since her playboy centerfold..like about 50!! the story line is ludicrous, the acting absolutely horrendous, and the tired old cliché's that are run over and over and over again, boy it took a lot of stamina to sit through this dog..the only thing worth it was the laughs!! and there are plenty! if you really want to kill say, an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop, but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you. i think that's who it was written for.. it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent, drug induced audience for this one..

i kind of like bam margera, so i was curious. but watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family, with a decent camera and a sound guy, just isn't good film-making. writing, direction, acting and editing is abysmal at best. but i sat through half of it. and why?this film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it is a film student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. cram it into film school curiculums all over the joint!so thanx bam! now i know jackass is for real - cause you ain't looking to win an oscar, dude:)

i did not think haggard was the funniest movie of all time i like cky and viva la bam a lot more. i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. i highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam, cky, or jack ass should see it. i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. i think that jonny knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. i think ryan dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more.

this movie was really bad. it has that quality that a lot of indie movies have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. any die-hard bam magera fan will prolly like this movie, but then again thats probably the only person who would see it. someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of jackass and was a fan of viva la bam, before the scripted nature of that show wore thin. to explain why this movie doesn't work i should just say the premise itself is played outa guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him. and pretty much the whole movie you've got this ryan dunn guy whining and bam magera skipping around like a merry mischief maker. dicamillo's performance is strange at best. it's a humorous little nonspecific canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like 'ok you're pretending to be foreign enough already")maybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an iq of zero. i love toilet humor as much as the next guy, but this isn't even lowbrow its just stupid. its like the only humor to be gotten from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those savvy to magera and company, are left out of the joke.next time magera is handed a sack full of money let's hope he doesn't blow it on some lousy pet project

wow...i just watched this movie...american people have this stereotypical view towards hindi films such as, all indian films have dances, songs and a love story....its pathetic how far away from the truth that is. this film simply exposes the stereotypical western view of hindi films. horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. and all this by a hollywood director. most indian films today are much more content driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of crap. indian cinema (not just hindi) also cover a variety of different subjects. just like most other hollywood films these days, this shows a very stereotypical view of of another country, where truth is thrown out the window. this is a highly not recommended movie. instead watch good hindi films like black friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother india, lagaan...those films are what real indian cinema are all about.

to put in simple words or rather a word, would be best suited by pathetic !!!!!! the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot, but, but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks, or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall....it seems like watching a movie from 1960's where colors were dull, directed by a debutant, and acted by high school students ! movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not-so-great indian movie. her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery.overall: i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch: then try watching it at home, when some tv channel airs it, believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors.and better carry a aspirin, u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel ! p.s. i have no clue, if the other reviewers even watched the movie ? i did and wasted my $10 on the ticket !

i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie. it didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd. the music was not bad it was quite nice. usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film. the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes, ali larter. her acting had a lot to be desired. however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore. all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie. thank you.

to me bollywood movies are not generally up to much, though they are still quite desired and bollywood is a big file maker as they have their own fans.the only motive that made me watch the movie was to see to what extent an american actress could change or affect the logic that indian movie were based on. not only did not it change the movie story also this blending caused some ridiculous series of events.i mean it is quite common to see heaps of illogical things through indian movies as they have their own world in their movies. but once you see such incidents happen to an american it makes you laugh. for god's sake can you believe a famous american actress is stuck in desperate situation and feel impotent. can you imagine an american actress falls in loves with a dance instructor whose fiancée already fell in love with american's boy friend and they met each other at the same time. there were lot of similar things to mention. the less said the better.perhaps i was wrong as i expected too much from indian movies.

the basic plot of 'marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop. an american actress marigold, played by ali carter gets stuck in india. worse that, she is out of money. she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation. here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem, played by salman khan. basically, the movie fails at the script level. just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn't guarantee quality cinema. marigold stands out as the best example. the art direction is weak and outdated. musically, marigold turns out to be a dud. shankar-ehsaan-loy's is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear. actingwise, salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date. ali larter is good and has immense screen presence. performance wise too, she is good.one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310

i read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it. i'm a big francophile and art film lover, but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something "arty" or "intellectual" into something it is not. i will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never, ever wanted to actually see. obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. the film is, in essence, disgusting. i mean, when i saw requiem for a dream, i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film.

i rented the video of "the piano teacher" knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box. i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad. unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud, "this movie is boring." about half way through i was saying to myself, "where have i seen this before?" at the three quarters mark i had figured it out.in spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of robert altman's much earlier (1969), and better, "that cold day in the park." although the details obviously differ and altman's work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. there is nothing "new" to be seen in this production. every aspect of it has been done before: a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (abel ferrara's "bad lieutenant" 1992); a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic (near) death scene (david cronenberg's "m. butterfly" 1993); uncommonly brutal sex scenes (david lynch's "blue velvet" 1986); and so on. hence, i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be "shocking," "shattering," etc. this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. however, i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film-viewing experience. see enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. and while it is true that i saw the expurgated 'r-rated' version, i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of "the piano teacher."technically, the film is not without merit. there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. isabelle huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. this is the first of haneke's films that i've seen, and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara: an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be. rating: 4/10.

question: how does a film merit two different titles like "the librarians" and "strike force"? answer: the film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on a title!!!! this film is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death wish-vendettas, melodrama, romance, and other cliché film techniques. the story focuses on a vigilante group called the librarians led by agent simon (william forsythe). the group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious, multi-lingual, pockmarked creature named marcos (andrew divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south florida. burt reynolds appears as a cameo in this film, and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action. burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls i have ever heard. this may have been burt's attempt at an irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of marlon brando in "the godfather." also appearing in this film is erika eleniak, who has infiltrated the inner circle of marcos' bizarre world. erika's character kick-boxes her way into an alliance with simon. the librarians and erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable tv converter box.

although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue, i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained "your father died today" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it's over. i loved movies such as "trainspotting" or "requiem for a dream" - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious - and i really wanted to like this film at every turn.

well, the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid. if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you. a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness. i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless. the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. the plot, however, has little to recommend. a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people. but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. not recommended.

i do not fail to recognize haneke's above-average film-making skills. for example, i appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. however, regarding the content of this film, i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or bdsm practices). the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter (i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). i mean d/s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something "freakish" or pathological; it isn't. in general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.so, for me, i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?), and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in d/s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).

isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor. the director of "la pianiste" understands this, providing the viewer with long takes of huppert's face, and these are a pleasure to see. huppert is not an animated actor--she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile.other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession, there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it. (well, if you enjoy self-mutilation, sado-masochism, and bizarre behavior, "la pianiste" might work for you. other than these attributes, i could not find any redeeming value in it.)buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth. people who compete at the very highest level--musically, athletically, whatever--begin as strange people, and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment.not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson. 

this movie purports to be a character study of perversion. some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically deep; actually, considering the salacious material, it is surprisingly tedious and shallow, with no motivational substance. why is the main character the way she is? you won't find out from the script. for a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try bunuel's belle de jour.

elfriede jelinek, not quite a household name yet, is a winner of the nobel prize for literature. her novel spawned a film that won second prize at cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?'gobble, gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. 'gobble, gobble' and the piano teacher are perfect partners.the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. it begins very badly, as if made to annoy the viewer. credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. we are introduced to professor erika kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress, a stony professor of piano. she lives with her husky and domineering mum. dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.reviewing the piano teacher is difficult, beyond registering its unpleasantness. what we see in the film (and might read in the book, for all i know) is a tawdry, exploitative, nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. not quite, because there's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies. if a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do), elrika's violently alternating moods would be it.a young hunk, walter, studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer, whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments, is also a talented pianist. he encounters elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris. in the glib fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme'.repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by erika, whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation.he soon declares his love and before long pursues erika into the ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. erika retains control over her lovesick swain. she promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.in the meantime, chillingly jealous because of walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert, erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands.the next big scene (by-passing the genital self-mutilation, etc) has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother. erika want to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. sensible walter is, for the moment, repulsed and marches off into the night.at this point there's still nearly an hour to go. the viewer can only fear the worst. erika tracks down walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. they retire to a back room. lusty wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. his 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. ho hum.repulsed but hooked, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, walter returns to erika's apartment. can you guess what happens now? it's not very deep or difficult. yes, he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim. one moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping erika, the next he's kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. am i being unfair in this summary? watch the film if you want, but i'd advise you not to.anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood. i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted. but i 'prefer not to', because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.i'm supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love, ineffectively seeks it in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt, blah, blah, blah.the world has, for reasons not explained, stunted her. she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.at the end, if you have the patience to be there, there's a small twist. before going to the final scene, where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands, erika packs a knife in her handbag. for walter?yes, you're ahead of me. she stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves. roll credits.if this earned the second prize at cannes, just how bad were the rest of the entries?

a man is builing a hotel with a partner. he finds out the hotel is over-insured. things just get worse. this film has a huge mumber of scenes. they must have been put together in someones' sleep. it jumps around from place to place. it does not stay focused on anything for very long. the ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire. it then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time. the dvd sound track is horrible. it takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film i have scene in a long time.

yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable. in fact this one is just boring. it's reasonably well made, even though the script is bad, the effects are ok and the acting average. (apart from james mason who is always great, but in this one underused)i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn't evoke any reaction in me what so ever.dull, dull, dull, dull, dull.

this flick is worse than awful! it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema. the photography is extremely amateurish . . . looks like a 5th graders home movie project filmed with malfunctioning 8mm kiddie cameras . . . the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks (while on drugs and booze), with scenes cut short, followed by other, unrelated scenes, then chopped segments of scenes pasted in . . . totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity . . . missing scenes . . . daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night-time scenes, then suddenly back to daytime . . . obviously no continuity. tom skerritt, wendy hughes and james mason's good acting skills are wasted, as are the talents of the "key" supporting cast - (forget the villain and the anderson women - very amateurish acting). this movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with skerritt and hughes . . . just have it professionally done this time.

***spoiler alert*** disjointed and confusing arson drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a major vacation resort before new years day. being insured for ten million dollars the man behind valley view estates in the blue mountains in australia julian fane, guy doleman,is determined to bring his own project down in flames in order to collect. this has to happen by january 1, two weeks hence, before the insurance policy on the project runs out.with his mind totally on his work builder and architect howard anderson, tom skerritt, has no idea that his boss, julian fane, is planning to burn down the resort he's building and possibly set him up as the fall guy. anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator sophie mccann,wendy hughes, informs him on some very fishy goings on between fane and the insurance company proud alliance. it turns out that proud allience is actually owned, or 60% of it, by fane himself! this explains whey fane is having all these arson fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire valley view estates is worth!we later have sophie mccann murdered, in a faked swimming accident, to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious fries around and in valley view estates. it's when lloyd's of london, who's underwriting proud alliance, insurance investigator george engles, james mason, shows up that fane takes a powder leaving his ace arsonist on his own and out of control to blow fane's entire plan.meanwhile anderson has gotten wise to both fane and engles who unlike fane wants the valley view estates to go under for reasons which are never made quite clear, just watch the last few seconds of the film to realize that, by it's writer and director. the arsonist is exposed as he's about to do in his girlfriend with anderson coming to her rescue. we then have this wild chase scene with the arsonist getting lost in the valley view construction site only to have it set on fire, with the help of howard anderson, where he ends up burning to a crisps by the time the fire department came to hose him down.the sudden and unexplained ending never made clear to just what happened to the big cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded julian fane. it's as if fane got away scot-free and only his unstable and deranged henchman, the arsonist, who was only the instrument of fane's crimes ended up as the only person who payed from them.

all things old are new again.erika e. is on celebrity fitness (vh1);florida state rep. mark foley is the national buzz for allegedly sending sexually explicit emails to a 16 yr. old male page.as i edit this mr.foley is resigning from his representative seat. mr.foley you see does his turn at acting as the father of the recovered girl seen during the opening sequence. my place in movie history will forever be solidified with my appearance in the graveyard scene.i should have looked at this as a omen.i hate to say it but be warned if you place this in your dvd be prepare to put your toe on the trigger of the shotgun you'll soon have between your teeth. your level of depression has reached its zenith.i have seen better writing put to screen on an etch a sketch.shot in 1999-00 under the working title "the librarians" in and around palm beach co.why the librarian's you ask,well you would need to be wrapped as tight as binding to be able to read anything into this frat party of over the hill stunt men plying their trade onto celluloid for one last time.oh well enough with the accolades...burt reynolds as a irish mobster, in miami no less...possibly the worst forced accent impression since linda lovelace in "deep throat". .william forsythe as a hip, slick and cool tough guy...doubtful,possibly 10 years ago.i'd say it's curtain time for mike kirton.you now have the forsythe to pass up this sub par movie,more like a film school project, for anything on tape,disc or paper your local retailer has to offer.

i've been on a bad run of films. this is a clinker about an arson plot and a psychopath. tom skerrit, whom i really enjoy, was pretty young here. he is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over-insuring and burning. into the mix comes an agent, who is drowned, his daughter, and her nut-case boyfriend. james mason plays the insurance investigator. any idiot, given a little warning, would know something was rotten in the nation of australia. still, they bumble their way. the most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built, never got beyond being a bunch of sticks. low budget, i guess. the plot could have been interesting. maybe they should have hired a film editor (the did?). half the time you don't know where the characters are, but i guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory. it doesn't work. although there is lots of neat fire.

additionally titled burning man and flash fire for its various releases, this australian made film, shot in new south wales is problematic for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that prematurely uses up its allocated budget, and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed, below standard post-production finishing and overmuch cutting jettisons the affair. tom skerritt plays as howard anderson, an american entrepreneur with a "passion for building" who is in process of erecting a tourist hotel in the blue mountains region, all the while unaware that his business partner, julian fane (guy doleman) has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars, far more than its actual worth, and plans its destruction as corollary to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud. in line with this illicit scheme, fane arranges for an arsonist to perform the incendiary deed, a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of anderson's daughter, and due to the future resort's being in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector (one of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay) julian has every expectation that his dastardly design will come about without serious hindrance. as the local insurance firm victimized by the crime is majority owned by fane, the policy's naturally skeptical underwriters, lloyd's of london, deploy senior investigator george engels (james mason) to probe into the nature of the felony, made more sinister because of the death, possibly a homicide, of an insurance investigator (wendy hughes) who, in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the arson. the setting for the film is the week before christmas, capstone of summer in the antipodes, a dramatic background, but the links within the story are not smoothly compounded, resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow, a problem heightened by erratic editing, the mentioned heavy cutting, and poor sound and picture quality. skerritt's semi-comatose and droning style is fatally invalidated by this dim sound processing but mason is very effective, as ever, and enjoys the best dialogue with hughes impressive as the too early written-out investigator; doleman wins acting laurels with his performance as the malevolent julian fane.

this movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. it is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. as the movie slowly progresses, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.also, mr. eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. a prime example of this is the scene on the odessa steps. for no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. this editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. honestly, i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed battleship potemkin as: "one of the greatest movies of all time" and, "truly a masterpiece". well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. my best guess is that my fellow potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. surely what they meant to say was: "one of the greatest snooze-fests of all time" and, "truly an epic fail".in conclusion, don't waste your time. if you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch a halo 3 montage. if i played the movie "battleship potemkin" in a game of slayer on guardian, i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then teabag its dead body. peace!

this is a really really bad movie. however it's good to laugh at the horrible ideas and "special" effects. the plot centers around an eu space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the earth. they send a maned mission (they have been to mars and have yet to discover this planet? is anybody stupid enough to fall for this?) to the planet and can you believe it, it's the mirror image of the planet they came from. most everything is predictable from that point. honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything. the only surprising thing here is a maned space program run by eurpoeans :) there really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution. so it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness.

this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters, subplots that go nowhere, and barely tolerable acting. it comes across as a poorly conceived rip-off of "2001."the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects. but even that wasn't enough to keep me from nodding off. i would like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the space flight sequence, for nights when i have trouble falling asleep.

being the sci-fi fan that i am, i was always curious about this film. so i was excited to see journey to the far side of the sun finally get released on an affordable dvd (the previous print had been fetching $100 on ebay - i'm sure those people wish they had their money back - but more about that in a second).anyway, the premise of this film (just like twilight zone's "the parallel") is that there is an undiscovered planet resembling earth on the "other side of the sun". this planet is of course exactly like ours except that it's inverted. this basically means their letters are reversed and people drive on the wrong side of the road.sound intriguing? well that's basically all there is to this film. the first hour or so is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet. it's just tedious scenes of switches being pressed, banal dialog, etc. there's no point to it whatsoever. gerry anderson managed to find the most boring british actors in the history of cinema to play most of the roles. i mean they are so dull i'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film.anyway, once the crew finally lands on the planet (after an interminable sequence of the astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), roy thinnes notices the copy is all backwards on a bottle of cologne and hops back on another ship to tell people about what he has discovered. oops he never gets to do it as he crash lands and dies. the end! oh wait, there's a bonus scene of one of the space executives hurling himself into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. i guess he wanted out of this film too.i'm really surprised a film like this could get made even back in the 60s. rent if you must. do not buy.

i'm also a sf buff, among other genres, and i especially like those films from 60's and 70's with their "ideas over effects" premise that produced so many intelligent and likable stories put on screen. in a nutshell i completely agree with scott-886's review of this movie. i heard of this film, and being what i previously mentioned, a 60's and 70's sf buff, with a penchant for sf stories with touch of the "twilight zone", i expected a lot, and my expectations were heightened with reviews ranking the effects of this movie "second best" to kubrick's "2001 space odyssey". what a fraud. "journey to the far side of the sun", was ordinary, convoluted, half baked, silly looking film, with laughable amateur special effects (and remember i love films from that era and despise cgi), and it can be fully compared more to 60's sf disasters such as "marooned", which "journey" very much reminded me of. the idea behind it all is not that bad, but building the plot on a story of a twin planet to earth, on which the same world is inverted, asked for a master like kubrick to direct. needles to say robert parish is nothing like that, so he delivered boring and silly movie, that looked and felt like a matinée tv series of those days. not worth wasting your time on, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.

i never saw the other two "ninja" movies and for all i know there are known, but for some reason i watched this one. this one starts out rather fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree. he is almost unstoppable as it takes quite a number of bullets to take him down. he is not out for the count though as he ends up possessing a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his tool. another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he volunteers. this leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war. sounds better than it actually turned out being, but at least it was not boring.

as stated by others, this is a ludicrously horrible movie (not a film!). it is not bad in a funny way, just painful to try to endure. don't waste your time.erika eleniak is pretty hot, but there is one scene where she is in a bathtub, and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles. also, she's getting fat.the fight scenes are so bad as to be unwatchable, if you know or care anything about martial arts, or even decent choreography, and the editing/effects are abysmal.there is no payoff, it goes nowhere, and sucks getting there.

if you like bad movies (and you must to watch this one) here's a good one. not quite as funny as the first, but much lower quality. a must-see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing.

this documentary attempts comedy, but never quite gets there for me. camp? ehn, maybe. the more apt word that everyone will agree on -- and have a hard time avoiding in any review -- is kitsch. it dripped kitsch. it was as if the film makers had worried their viewers would take the movie too seriously, and so they bent over backwards to insert kitsch and proclaim, "we're joking around here! see???"in short, i felt it was trying too hard. for example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (to me) annoying when i'm sure they were meant to be amusing -- or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey.do not, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. just be ready to revel in kitsch rather than having it thrust at you unprepared. if you're interested in lighthearted fare, you could do far, far worse. at the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the bakers make this interesting and worth a view. at best, gaggles of like minded kitsch lovers will hoot and holler over choice bits throughout the film.

plankton, or creatures from the abyss as i'm positive it's more commonly known as & filmed under as the title creatures from the abyss appears over a moving image & in the same font type as the rest of the credits, starts with five 20 something kids, mike (clay rogers) his girlfriend margaret (sharon twomey), sisters julie (ann wolf) & dorothy (loren depalm) & an annoying idiot named bobby (michael bon) whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat & head out to sea, don't ask why as i don't know. oh & the complete idiot bobby left the petrol behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor & to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm & discover a dead body floating in the water. shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht & potential safety, in a flash everyone boards the yacht & begin to explore. first of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens & computer equipment, then down below they find fully furnished & luxurious cabins. they find a chemist (deran sarafian) who appears mad & can't talk. they eat fish from the fridge which makes dorothy puke up green vomit, beetles & slugs. they learn that these fish are living fossil's 1000's of years old & have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea & that they fly, mutate, bite & are generally unpleasant to be around. i really can't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so i won't, here's what i think...this italian production was produced & directed by massimiliano cerchi under the pseudonym al passeri (i'd hide under a different name if i made a film this bad too) & i think plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever, there are so many things wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start. first the script by richard baumann is total crap, it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow & dull it was torture for me to sit through. why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in? what were they planning on doing exactly? why do we often get point-of-view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character, & how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in? people's actions & reactions to things are all wrong, they constantly split up, they make bizarre decisions that simply don't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in & some of the dialogue is as awful as anything i've heard. i could go on all day about all the plot holes & ridiculous goings on but i'll run out of space if i do. the fish creatures themselves look awful, a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets & some really bad stop motion animation at the end, the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition. i have heard a lot of comments saying that plankton is gory, don't make me laugh! forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in plankton whatsoever, there are a couple of slimy scenes when bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with julie but it's pretty brief & he doesn't kill her, he just sort of drips slime on her, grows a couple of tentacles & a fish head comes out of his mouth. later on julie's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that's it, we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is. dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back, off screen, & control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while margaret commits suicide, a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead. easily the grossest scene is when dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles & slugs in it. that's it, only one person actually dies on screen & for the most part plankton is quite tame & as exciting as watching paint dry & i nearly fell asleep it's so boring. i can't see how anybody can like this total crap, i just can't. the acting is awful, the dubbing is awful, the characters are awful & i hated all of them. tecnically plankton is predictably crap as well, with an estimated budget of only $250,000 all i can say is where did the money go? the sets are monotonous & dull with one lab & a few cabins, the special effect's are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever, the cinematography is bland, the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension & as a whole plankton, like it's name sake, is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be. i hate plankton, it's awful in every single aspect of it's overlong 86 minute duration. do yourself a favour & avoid this one at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac.

boasting some pretty good rick baker-esque special effects and deran serafian in a small role, this pretty lame italian movie deserves some recognition. cerchi gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other italian directors (ruggero deodato, sergio martino, lamberto bava, and enzo g. castellari) have moved on to lower-key tv movies. as for plankton, it's half piranha - half the thing, with people turninging into monsters, raping women, and causing general mayhem. the ultra-grimy, sleazy, and over-sexed feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy. only available in italian language work-prints floating around.

snake island is one of those films that, whilst one sits and watches its amazing level of stupidity, makes one wish the film camera had never been invented. the real reason why plan 9 from outer space will hold onto its honoured title of worst film of all time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is. it is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining bad film you will ever see. snake island is the other kind of bad. snake island is just so bad that it is excruciating. a stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys tapping one-key typewriters onto transparencies that were then overlapped in order to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. filmed entirely on location in south africa, the environments in which the film takes place are about the only element that can truthfully be considered well-realised. many shots involving snakes consist of close-ups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are cgi, puppets, or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugs.william katt stars, if you can call it that, as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry. coming along with him is an assortment of very generic, poorly-defined characters. it is all a matter of random screen writing as to who survives to the end, but katt certainly appears to be contemplating firing his agent. the rest of the cast seem to be from the home and away acting school, where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by open-mouthed gaping and darting one's eyes about in every direction. the foley effects are often worse, with one memorable scene where a double-barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany gunshots in such games as bioforge. meanwhile, snakes continually explode or jump about at random. it would have been more accurate to call the film snake holocaust.of course, no z-grade horror or sci-fi film is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undress. as every woman in the cast, almost, gets their clothes off, the film starts to become less snake island and more snake island orgy. but like all the worst piles, all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff. the sex scenes never eventuate, and the deaths of characters are so flat, so uninteresting, that the entire film becomes pointless. unless you consider watching william katt running through a muggy forest wearing ill-fitting cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat a payoff. for the record, i don't. i used to think that anaconda was the worst film ever made about predatory snakes. i was so very, very wrong. at least anaconda had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time. some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the shoelaces from some pairs of combat boots i have worn.so we so far have the checklist for bad horror films running along nicely. the unrecognisable, lame cast are accounted for, as are poor audio and visual effects. the dialogue is so wretched, so ill-timed, that i have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays i have acted in many moons ago. unfortunately, where snake island falters in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films. in essence, it forgets to be so bad that it is funny. it is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak. compared to william katt's performance in snake island, jon voight's performance in anaconda was as oscar-worthy as russell crowe's in gladiator. not that voight or katt are necessarily bad actors, but with material like this, you're hard-pressed to say a single word naturally. listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. one's mind tends to blank out the experience, primary as a self-defense mechanism.because of the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad, i gave snake island a two out of ten. my special score for films that are so bad they cannot possibly be good, but not bad enough to entertain. it is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern. the proper way to spell "crap" is s-n-a-k-e-i-s-l-a-n-d.

i'm not going to lie and say i don't watch the show--i do. but it has a lot, and a lot of flaws. 1) the boarding school is perfect. the drama is at a minimum. everyone is so nice to each other, you know. lets give that a reality check. its impossible that any school is perfect like pca. free laptops for everyone. big dorm rooms. mini fridges. if there was a school like that in real life, almost nobody there would be a virgin for one. two, everyone there is so rich, and its weird how nobody has anything stolen yet. 2) characters really unrealistic. first things first, who in they're right minds talk like they do. they talk like a perfect teenager would. secondly, logan reese(matthew underwood) is an extremely rich boy "hot" teenage boy. my question is, why isn't almost ever girl in that school all over him? he's rich and "hot" now a days all those girls would be after him, even if he was a jerk. also, chase is the most stupidest person ever. he is this shy teenager who claims to not be in love with zoey, and over-reacts to everything that involves zoey. she must be blind not to see him in love with her.come on nick. i know you can do better than that. please..

zoey 101 is basically about a girl named zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it. that raw plot line is, i'll admit, a pretty good idea. although this show was meant for children, a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws. first, zoey is a cliché character, her being super popular, super attractive, super smart, and there;s nothing wrong with her; no girl is like that. it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie lynn spears and increase her fame. dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just plain mean. however, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of them all, which is sad seeing that dana is never nice. nicole is too peppy and acts like a complete airhead, but mysteriously gets straight a's. lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmy-deserving acting skills. quinn is supposed to be super smart, and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things, she is also made out to be weird, and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart, while zoey, lola, and nicole get guys and they're all beauty and no personality. chase and michael are very similar, and i even sometimes get them confused. logan is unrealistically rich, and hands out millions like they're dollars. nobody's that rich. i've also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that stacy girl, who does nothing but act nice to them. that's not funny! that's mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people. finally, the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5-star amenities such as a scenic location, sushi bar, hot lounge equipped with free soda machines, pool&jacuzzi, movie theater, and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other sex's dorm rooms. at most boarding schools, if a boy were to go into a girl's dorm or vice versa they would be expelled.in conclusion, zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process.

zoey 101 is such a stupid show. i don't know if that's because the snooty jamie lynn spears is the prissy star of it or what, but i just know that the show sucks. it's about a girl and her brother who go to a boarding school. the jokes in this show are extremely dull and unfunny, and i hate every single character except chase and lola. heck, the jokes on this show are so unfunny that they make jack black look like monty python.this show is without a doubt one of the worst shows on nickelodeon, it's right down there with avatar and danny phantom in the pit of shame, and if this show was a person with any honor, it would hang itself in shame.1/10

this is a children's tv series about a mary-sue who is at the same time, mean and bitchy. i couldn't bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of zoey101. not to mention that jamie lynn spears can't act to save her life! what message does this show bring to kids? if you're not perfect like zoey, you're unworthy *rollseyes*.it's absurd how zoey's character is exactly the type of person who would be despised in real life yet she manages to become so popular. then there is chase who is basically a lovesick puppy who worships the ground zoey walks on. then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been dumbed down in order to stop them from outshining zoey. i'm sorry but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.

this was another one of those shows that i watched to root out the positive elements, and because i've been a nick fan for years. some of those would be the stage sets, b-plots, guest stars, and a few of the main actors that were good. i dabbled in the show through high school as i quickly grew to despise jamie spears, along with the other chicks in the show that can't act. the only characters i seemed to like were dustin, quinn, stacey, michael & logan. quinn is a perfect outcast that eventually started to fit in; stacey is a complete oddball; dustin gets put through a bunch of strange, random situations; and michael is kind of the comic relief right-hand man of logan. there's a remarkable difference between the execution & acting quality of the b-plots that involve them, and the a-plots that showcased a bunch of screeching girls and an iconic "miss perfect," repeating bad lines and obsessing over guys. this show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the side plots, but the main plots just don't deliver anything. when it recently came back in reruns, and i tried to watch it again, i was more calloused towards the girls' abysmal acting and had to change the channel. however, i will give the previously listed characters credit because they did make the show more or less worth my time.

i strongly dislike this show. i mean, like, basically everyone at that school is perfect, and rich, and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that. and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school? isn't that just a little weird? anyways, jamie lynn spears cannot act. she always has the same facial expression, which really annoys me. she is basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her.and shouldn't chase tell her he likes her? its not that hard! really! none of this show is real life, and she isn't "a girl like me" because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes, and do not live by the beach.fake fake fake.

okay people, i have to agree with almost everyone else's reviews here. the characters. are. stupid. they're all stereotypical, and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny.don't even get me started on jamie lynn's role as zoey. zoey is a pretty, popular, tan, blonde young teen who everyone just loves! she has a "rebellious", great, personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is. most annoying of all: her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious. "omg!"take for example the first episode. the moment she steps onto the huge pca campus, everyone seems to love her. the boys want to ask her out, the girls want to be her friend, etc. thinking she's all that, the episode plays out with zoey always being the center of attention; she is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team, confident, and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face. oh boo-hoo.my favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show, lauren or something, who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate zoey.and zoey doesn't even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes. in one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without ever apologizing and doesn't show the least bit regret in doing so.zoey is always the best:-desiging professional t-shirts and backpacks (which become a big hit)-coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach a single person a lesson. -flawless grades -taking the blame for stuff that wasn't even related to her just so everyone else could be happy.-coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on tv. the list goes on and on...ugh. she has no acting talent. she's always the perfect person. she acts snotty and rebellious and preppy and...ugh! can't stand her.not only that, but everyone in the show always has great clothes. even the nerd! her wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty freaking decent.no one cares if everyone at pca loves you, zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it meant giving their right arm.but regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. not everyday things. they're interesting and amusing. the humor is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so paper flat that it's hard to enjoy it.this show would be really good if dan schnieder put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that's it's lame and stupid.point: no one's the least bit overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, zoey is the definition of mary-sue, the story lines are well-thought out, and the humor is laughable. but again, i want to emphasize that the characters taint the show. watch the show if you must, but don't say i didn't warn you if your eyes start to bleed.

i actually belong to the demographic zoey 101 specifically is trying to target, so i can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age, the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to. the show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence, and the lovely, incredibly tan, attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. as is the tradition amongst kids networks, the cast is an array of skinny white kids, with the token black guy, of course.the story lines all revolve around zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma, such as not wanting to attend gym class, resulting in zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends. there is generally a b-line revolving around either a one- sided guest character, or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations, such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing. these plots often play off stereotypes, such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills. the majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will-they won't-they chase-zoey dynamic.the characters, unfortunately, are all incredibly one-sided; there is zoey, the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything,chase, the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing best friend, michael, the token black guy (kudos to christopher massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners), lola, the theater chick (meaning she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom, despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater), logan, the womanizing narcissist, dustin, the spazzy little brother, and quinn, the science geek. the few words i spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely.zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times, but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff. zoey, who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless, still manages major character flaws. for example, when lola was first introduced, she was believed to be a goth girl. zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being "freaky".as for the acting, it is quite clear that jamie lynn spears landed this role because of her name, not because of talent. although she has definitely improved as time goes by, it is clear she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, as most of the plot lines revolve around her character. the supporting cast is surprisingly good, especially considering the material they have to work with. they deliver quite a few good one-liners for comic relief, if the plot hasn't yet ventured into obscurity.all in all, zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life, and anyone past their limited too years shouldn't expect much from it.

this show sucks. it was put on fridays on roller-coaster, and whilst it undoubtedly destroyed the running theme of friday programming i shall judge it rationally... still i think it sucks. it really is super lame. zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame. the lame continuuity and pot sucks and i reckon the dialogue and joes are weak. the weak humour and lame sucky characters suck, and the whole show is frankly a disappointment not worth watching. it sucks and is really, really lame. it really has to be one of the lamest shows on tv, really not worth watching. i mean how lame weak and sucky can a show get before it gets axed?

zeoy101?? really, this has to be one of the most stupidest attempts to get people in my age group's attention. it's about some preppy girl named zeoy and her friends that attends boarding school. boring!!! all she ever does is whine and complain and acts like a spoiled idiot. i remember this show came out in 2005, i was 13 going on 14, and even then i thought it was pointless. the only episode i ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls dorm. that's it. anyway, i just don't understand why nickel-oh my bad-nick feels the need to syndicate this sorry poor excuse for "entertainment". serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worst and worst. what's with this generation??anyway, r.i.p. nickelodeon 1979-1998?/2005?

blond main character, always believes in everyone and when you stick together you can do anything! shy guy best friend with curly hair (rip off of gordo) wants to be a movie director has a secret crush on zoey. spanish best friend (rip off of miranda) weird smart girl quinn (rip off of lary tudgemen)and the popular stock up prep logan (rip off of kate)and zoey's little brother max, annoying (rip off of matt)zoey is the semi popular girl, with 2 best friends. the only thing it's missing is the funny little sacastic cartoon lizzie mcguire has, and hillary duff was a lot cuter. jamie lynn spears looks more like a tooth pick in a tube top.

i first watched this show hoping for a few laughs, good acting, and good plot. sadly, i got none of those things.first off, this show is completely unrealistic. how can someone go to a boarding school that's super hip, awesome location, and barely any rules? plus a sushi bar. a sushi bar. no school has a sushi bar. and what's up with the huge, ultra cool, ultra hip dorm rooms? this doesn't happen in boarding schools! everyone in this show seems to be perfect. zoey, looks perfect, has the perfect friends, never has to do homework, and is super popular. sounds more like a villain to me! i hate how they use so many cliques in this show, example: dana the skater chick. she is completely ignorant and wears "edgy" clothes. the jokes are old sooooo old too! i wouldn't watch this show if i were you, it's one of the most horrible shows i have ever watched and i hope it gets canceled soon! rating: 1/10

first, i want to clear a common misconception: it is not unrealistic that the school zoey goes to gives students laptops. at my school, those in grade 7 and higher must have apple macbooks (this is payed for in the entrance fee). moving on. this show is very annoying. it has boring, predictable plots and bad acting. often in the show it brings "girl power" to a new high, with girls beating guys in everything they try. but that is not the worst. the worst is that girls are nevertheless all portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances, and screaming whenever they are happy. except for the one smart girl, who is portrayed as a freak who is obsessed with ugly boys and science. however, this show is very addictive. i do not know why, but it is. although, the most recent season has been so terrible, bringing the stereotypes, boring plots, and bad acting to extremes i never thought were reachable, so i am no longer addicted, thankfully.

imagine this: a high school. except it's boarding school, and the kids don't have parents around. oh, and it's in malibu. and the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the "weird" outcast. and there aren't any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student.here's the story: a girl, zoey brooks, attends pca, a formerly all-boys school. absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. she's the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. too bad none of this makes her likable.are we supposed to believe that if we don't even come close to zoey's perfection, we're bad people? in the show, nothing's her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they're portrayed as the bad guy(logan). he may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.her loyal group of blind followers are: chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes.what ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they're normal kids. they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. wow, they have it hard! any other problems? i'm too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! i guess zoey 101 (what's the 101 for, anyway?) is nick's attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn't like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on the hills.but hey, at least the set's pretty.

i have seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them i was forced to watch. and i did not like the episodes i saw. what happened to dan schneider? after giving us such awesome shows like drake and josh, why did he decide to create a stupid show like this? my problem is not just with dan, it is also with the guys who nominated this show for an emmy, were they drunk that day, or what's the problem? drake and josh didn't get nominated for an emmy, but it's way better than zoey 101. the makers of this show should be ashamed for the existence of this show, let's just hope the pregnancy of you know who will affect the show, or better yet it'll cause it to get canceled.

this television show is stereotypical and far-fetched in many of its aspects.first of all, the setting. all of the characters attend pca, this unbelievable boarding school with painted, stylish dorms. the campus seems to have no reasonable rules - for instance, the boys are often seen in the girls' dormitories, and vice versa. but this may be simply because the dorm adviser, a silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them, as i assume her purpose is supposed to be, sits around and does nothing. i have friends in boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show.next, the characters. i was so disappointed to discover that nickelodeon wasn't creative at all with the personalities in this show. they all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme: zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does (looks, grades, sports, guys, judgment, creativity, etc), michael is the jock, logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers, nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight-a's, dana was the tough girl, quinn is the unrealistic 'smart kid,' whom they consistently make fun of, chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his 'true feelings' which really aggravates me as the show continues, and that new girl- lola or something- is just another clone of nicole.the main two characters that aggravate me the most are zoey and quinn. first of all, i just do not understand zoey's character. she was obviously created to be the 'perfect' character as i said above, but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them- in most of the episodes she creates a problem, then has to fix it. what's frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they haven't even created a very realistic character to begin with.quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting. the impression i get from nick concerning her character is that 'geeks' and 'nerds' are people to laugh at, to criticize, to mock. in the spring break episode they did a year ago, they introduced two more 'nerds' who the characters had to make 'cool.' i found this highly offensive and stereotypical. what kind of message is nick sending to these kids? is it: don't do well in school, don't get good grades, don't study hard- you'll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series! because that is definitely the message i get from these poorly constructed characters, and it is an awful message through and through.all i can do is hope that nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world, they are not doing anyone any good.

the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when i'm making fun of it. jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister, and i don't think anyone could argue with me on that. there is no expression in her face ever (even when she smiles) - just watch the show and you'll see what i mean. now let's talk about the show. zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows i've ever seen! as a lot of people have already said, zoey brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she's a straight a student, and all the boys think that she's "hot." pca is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flat-screen tvs and laptop computers, serving kids sushi from the sushi bar. in one of the newest episodes, zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her, and acts as if she doesn't even want chase to love her. then, when she barges into chase's dorm room to prove her friends wrong, she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca. zoey, of course, freaks out, probably because she likes the attention from chase. anyway, only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101. you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!

for any fan of nickelodeon who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good on. you had entertaining acts like you can't do that on television. you had weird but good shows like pete & pete. you even had cartoons that taught morals like doug. but just like disney, nickelodeon has fallen down the tubes, limiting their demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. as i tried watching zoey 101, i just shook my head in disgust.the setting couldn't of been more fake than this one. each character attends a boarding school called pacific coast academy, boasting everything that a spoiled child wants. a sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen tvs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. the kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers. it looks more like a place that you would spend on a nice summer vacation rather than to work and study while preparing for college.the characters were also a factor that turned me off. every episode consists of boy problems, situations that they caused themselves, and troubles that should be solved. each character is a stereotype. zoey (jamie lynn) seems perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends ask her for help when they feel they are in grave danger. only leading her to have no other side. i've been through school and i can tell you, nobody is like that. chase is dumb. logan plays the arrogant tough guy. quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does. michael is an idiot. lola is a clone of nicole. dana is just well, a tough person. why not use some originality? something that is unique for these characters, and different from other personalities? is being stereotypical the best the creators of this show can come up with? instead, these actors are dull personalities with the sense in that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles. there is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at.not only that, but the show is clearly for the intent of aiming for kids of adolescence, facing a stage in that they must evolve from being a child to being an adult. through that period they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions, and do what's right for them. zoey 101 contains nothing of those values. in this case, we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. i'm sorry, but that simply isn't true. people can't expect things to be handed to them like the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there. if i expect things in zoey 101 to happen in real life, then i would be living in a fantasy world locked away in a dream house. nothing in this show relates to those who face health and money issues. neither does it relate to kids wanting to learn something meaningful.so in conclusion, zoey 101 is a show made by nickelodeon that only falls flat on it's face. it displays a horrible message for kids and i highly think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. sure, it doesn't have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid. a horrible show, and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage nickelodeon has been making in recent years.1 out of 10.

i've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it, the less i like it. jamie lynn spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is britney's sister and i'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious. they've created the character zoey to be everything people want to believe jamie lynn is, clever, original, smart, pretty, popular etc. the characters around her are only there to make her look better, by being smarter then them, more popular than them, more wanted by boys then them. there is nothing original about this and it's poured with money, so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff. i also have to say, for a 13 year old girl (or however old she is, can't be much older) she wears very mature clothing, those short skirts are too short, it makes young people want to wear them, and all that make-up, this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble. the only thing i will say is that the opening credits are sung by jamie lynn and, given her age, isn't bad at all, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability. sorry, it's too mature and yet too dumbed down. it's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too.

shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings. welcome to the life of zoey brooks and her friends. zoey brooks is portrayed by jamie lynn spears, the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star britney spears. with her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent, it's confirmed that nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism. when kristin herrera, the actress who portrayed dana cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress. the female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media. if they continue to pursue jamie lynn spears as the picture of perfection, very many people will have to lower their standards. with hope, they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing. jamie lynn spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career. there is no wondering why she is a self-proclaimed actress. critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that.

this show makes me(and many others) hate their lives. let's face it, zoey is perfect; she's bland pretty, gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she's popular, she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms. reasons why i gave this show a 3: 1. the acting is horrible.sometimes i just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actresses(especially victoria justice) on television. 2. the characters are unbelievable and mismatched. you have your typical popular girl. a peppy, shallow, stupid ,stereotypical, girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress. then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice.then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers. then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier gazing into a mirror all day. then the wanna be actress who is played by another stinky actress. and last a normal nerd person guy. 3. the plot is boring, and lame. 4. i hate how spoiled these characters are. can't they just be normal! 5. everything ends up perfect for them, and we all are reminded of how much our lives stink.

right, where do i start? i cannot even imagine to comprehend this preteen pathetic excuse of a show. picture this: a boarding school, where kids whose parents are rolling in money simply chuck them in there so as to jet around the world themselves. it could not get any more diabolic than this.if you taught these kids, shall not even upgrade them to the term teenagers, because they hardly even act like sane homosapiens, were self-centered, think again. about 23 minutes choked full of their so-called problems, boy troubles, and the like.the heroine of the show, of course, mademoiselle zoey, played by britney's polly pocket little miss i'm all that sister, jamie lynn spears, has obviously much to learn about acting. however, i will give her some face, because her superficial, one dimensional character, does not allow much room for depth. she plays pacific coast academy's sun, moon and stars, crusader fighting for the plight of all women, equality of all genders.perfect in everyway, always with her two loyal sidekicks, nicole, the daffy bimbo, who obviously has too much of daddy's cash, and tough chick, dana, who proves a hard nut to crack. both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that i blame that. but horror of horrors, in comes lola, who deems herself the greatest actress since natalie wood, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. she is even more rude than zoey herself, if that is even possible, and even more dumber than nicole, and hell, we know that cannot be possible.this show, like all the sorry excuses for television programmes nickelodeon has been spewing out since 2000s, is a prime victim of stereotyping. get girl next door and dense to her best friend's feelings for her zoey, a great albeit inarticulate at times best boy friend, chase, a cool, arrogant ladies man, logan, a boy and clothes crazy girl, who is not very bright, nicole, the one whom everyone thinks is weird just because she is extremely smart, the nerd, quinn, the over-dramatic, annoying yet super thin, malibu picture perfect model, lola, and the tough yet soft inside woman, dana. now, where have i heard these characters before? i am sorry, but what is so wrong with having a personality? just because quinn is passionate about science, and actually cares about her future and doing well in the academic aspect, in which the rest should be concerned about as well, she is "weird" and a "nerd"? lola at the beginning of the series, proved to be a potential great character with her sassy ways and different outlook in life, zoey just had to go, get out your pitchforks, burn her at the stake, she's going back to weird town and all that jazz. so much for womens rights. unfortunately, lola just became nothing more of another oc clone, in all its anorexic glory. probably so as to not outshine her mistress.but hey, the 2000 generation of myspace whores seem to love it with the chase/zoey typical fairytale romance, the tension between adamant, "hot" logan and "kick-ass" zoey or dana, whichever to your liking, and the pretty people. please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, shallow and vapid lifestyle. sorry to break it to you darlings, that will not happen, unless you have a major trust fund and parents to cushion you.

when i first watched zoey101 with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage. no one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast. in the show, zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice. zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is. she is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure. and she is such a dietetic freak she talks about carbs like she knows what they are. when she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it. and another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her. and everyone wants something do with her, for example in one episode that logan guy bid $4,000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life. and her friend nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lot.and lola dresses like a hoochie houdini lady. 80s called they want there bushy hair back.might as well shave off the hair chase. this show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they don't have the latest i-pods and designer clothes they will hate themselves. this show is a big thumbs down. we hate you jamie lynn, best wishes ryan, and kara l

this is the absolutely worst show in the history of nickelodeon. first of all, no boarding school has a sushi bar, flat screen tvs, and gives every student a laptop. this makes the show so unrealistic, and boring. the plots are pointless, and incredibly boring. the actors are so bad, it makes me want to take my own life. i really hate the fact that in the show, zoey is the most popular girl in school, and the prettiest, and smartest, and gets the best grades without doing any work. she never has any real problems, and every guy wants to date her. she is so perfect. there isn't anyone like that. also, i hate that everyone would do anything for her, and everyone picks her for every team, or club. it is so annoying. quinn is so obnoxious. her experiments are pathetic, pointless, and fake. chase is such a wimp. he says he loves zoey, but if he told her, it would ruin their friendship. how pathetic. michael tries to be funny, but he never accomplishes anything. nichole is so perky, and screams a lot. she is never seen doing any work, or studying, but she is a straight a student. lola thinks she is an actress, but she sucks (excuse my language). need i say more? i think no. for your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.

i have tried to like this show, i really have, but i can't find a reason why anyone would like it. the story lines are weak, the acting is weak and unbelievable. every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random. and it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for jamie lynn spears to be able to move on to movies. every episode shows zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date. she's always perfect and no one is like that in real life. how can people relate to a character that is just a barbie doll? jamie lynn's acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series. all the show's fans are just young girls who don't know any better. i'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach party - please accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch.

i was looking forward to watching this movie, and it does contain very interesting perspectives from iraqis all over the country, not just in major areas.however, as the film went on, and as it seemed to become increasingly more one-sided, i started wondering who had edited the film. to get several hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes, obviously decisions had to be made.i would have really enjoyed a film that showed how everyday iraqis felt on all sides of the issues, but with the newspaper headlines in contrast to what people were saying, and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end, i thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a pre-conceived bias.it could have been such a great film.

well there's a few things about this movie. everyone should see it. you see the nation of iraq like you've never seen it covered by the media, and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most americans, where the movie has its main audience. however all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie. there were 150 cameras handed out to the iraqi people most all of which view the war and subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the bettering of their nation. and in comparison to saddam it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin. also, netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending out a mass e-mail to its entire roster to see the film. many of the, what should be labeled as opinions played out as facts listed off by the interviewed iraqis are wrong. if one is to review the red cross' records of abu ghraib tortures it wasn't saddam's henchmen who were being tortured it was a fine mix of a 80-90% innocent civilians and 10-20% rightfully detained people. never was it disclosed that any of that 10-20% were saddam's henchmen or curfew violators. in addition the arab world really has never listed 'democracy' as one of their opponents, more correctly it is the usa's 6 billion dollars a year to isreal, our military bases in saudi arabia and our interest in oil. i agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows that same distortion. i'm afraid that the iraqi people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a yankee voice. yes its true that saddam is a puke, and that his removal many see for the best. its true that some iraqis actually get paid a good wage. just as its true that no iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and us corporations do. nor does it mention that 20,000 civilians have died due exclusively to us artillery. still 15% of the country which once had running water and electiricity now does not. nor does it mention that from 1993-2003 un sanctions purposed and authored by the usa government killed over 200,000 iraqi civilians. nor does it mention that democracy in when people decide the government, not a massive war machine that sends the message, 'be killed or obey'. i am afraid that the cutting room floor must have quite a bit of iraqis that aren't so happy with the occupation. just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war. in fact the america, britian, spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy, they turned their back to it when they saw how full their pockets could be. hurray, saddam is out of power, but i'm afraid that no iraqi is yet in power. corporations are in power, the media is in power. read, do your own research, and don't let them blindfold you.

just do a little research on the making of this film. something so simple as a google search. it was funded by the us army and promoted just in time for the elections. it is a great idea, but i'd much rather see a documentary, not something edited by the bush administration and told its reality. the timing of the movie's release, its tone, and the fact that ms&l promoted it, raised questions about the intent of the movie. "according to ms&l managing director joe gleason, he and his colleagues also deliver key targeted messages about the war in iraq to specific constituencies," wrote eartha melzer. "was the left-leaning art house crowd one of those constituencies? is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to propagandize the u.s. population? nobody involved with the film is willing to say who initially put up the money for the film or how they ended up represented by the army's pr firm."

i had looked forward to viewing this movie, it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it. i was completely disappointed. the acting was so overdone. the script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one plagarized script.spoilers: was any cliche omitted in this movie? there was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous godfather wannabees, the main character in love with the prostitute, cross dressing, torture by the police, hannibal lechter style mutilations, i could go on and on.line's like (the godfather wannabe to the prostitute)-"ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (i don't want u to work anymore)-"ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (who would pay the rent if i didn't work)unrealistic scenes: we never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes, yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks.the only way i can make sense out of this whole movie, is if the version i had scene was severely edited from the original. i definitely do not recommend it, and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so.

this movie has the feel of a college project over it, who wants to do a blair witch project meets saw theme. but it isn't successful. the cinematography is poor, and the acting even more so. the characters, in my opinion doesn't come off as being credible at all. the editing of the film isn't really working as intended either. there are a lot of poor effects, which i believe are put in there to try and add a horrid effect. but to me it just gives me a feeling of indifference.i would stay away from this movie, unless you are a dedicated movie freak, who likes to watch "different" and indie "horror" movies. however, i believe this movie is not worth watching, for the average person. you will get no pleasure out of the poor effects, and the handycam feel, which this movie bestows on it's viewers.

i have to start out by saying that the actresses and actor did a fine job for what they worked with. the problem in dark reality is you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative he ended up trashing up the film. from start to finish you can tell the film reel quality itself is low, but the poor lightning and shaky camera only hurt it further by obscuring what is going on. the sound is muffled and often times not understandable. i'm sure huston (the director) would argue this was to induce a state of panic in the audience, but he had more than ample material in which to do it. having to result to camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome.the story is good. a basic sadistic female kidnapper story that avoids cliché by keeping the girl's in a state of despair the whole time for good reason. billy bob from silence of the lambs treated his victims better than netwon. the biggest problem with the story is that dead people constantly harass the lead character in her mind, and by the second time they showed up i was fast forwarding as this was attempting to destroy the only decent part of the film.in the end, the way the director pieced it together showing random blurry things and constant barely viewable scenes (not because of horror, because of the lighting, angles, and camera) ultimately destroyed this film. huston was obviously trying too hard and if anything it resembled a bad film school project. if you want to see a decent story then it's all right, but be warned the film quality is enough for most to turn it off.

8 days no script that's what the dvd tells you is how the movie was made. it's shot in blurry video that's occasionally used to good effect, but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time. it is very well acted and this helps a lot. but the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls/women sit and mope they don't try to escape or do anything too interesting, so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes. would have been a good short maybe even powerful. even for eight days they do very little. why? because they had no script. how many movies have been made without scripts. not too many. i wonder why that is? how many great movies have been made from bad scripts. not too many. why is that? working against this major problem, the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing. topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length. actors again deserve praise, if only there was a script.also the video quality, or lack thereof, is really low end, they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from miami vice, the recent movie that is. but that's not intended to compliment miami vice or this failed venture.

dark reality is a saw like movie that is slightly decrepit. while the plot and story are good, there is a little too much unnecessary nudity. while i feel the film was technically well done, the acting was spotty, it was just a little too dark for my mood while i was watching it. it basically says that there are a lot of missing people out there that will never be found and are perhaps being tortured by sick whackos. i feel that some information on the captors and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some. it came of as a snuff film, just made for the violent content. if you like to see women beaten, tortured, and killed then this is for you. if you're looking for something a little liter and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.

awkward disaster mishmash has a team of scavengers coming across the overturned s.s. poseidon, hoping to loot it before it goes under for good. irwin allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster "the poseidon adventure" arrived in theaters seven years later! never mind that nobody cared anymore, why give us such a shoddy production, filled with dim characters and miscast actors, only to trash the memory of your biggest hit? one might end up feeling really sorry for michael caine, sally field, peter boyle, jack warden, karl malden and shirley jones were it not for their lost-at-sea expressions (good for a few stray laughs). there's a moment when saintly jones is tempted into taking some treasures just for herself and she timidly starts stuffing her pockets that is an unintended hoot. the film was a career bungler for all concerned, most especially allen, who never quite recovered from this. * from ****

wretched. talk about botched. beyond the poseidon adventure is bad in every respect. salvagers michael caine and karl malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat. they're challenged by ruthless telly savalas and his gang of machine-gun toting goons. this part sequel, part remake has caine, malden and another group of poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. among this group are shirley jones, slim pickens, peter boyle, shirley knight and slim pickens. jack warden plays a blind man. surely, you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess. sally field is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board caine's tug.disaster master irwin allen not only produced this one, he decided to direct it as well.

sequels, well there are many reasons to make 'em but what went through irwin allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters. there are so many open answers to this movie that it is ridiculous...like the poseidon which is a monstruous ship with passengers on is drifting on the sea and just michael caine with his miniboat and an evil telly savalas discover the boat...well, at the beginning the french marine are circling above the wreck with their helicopter but as a sinking cruiseship is a daily thing, they just fly away... what am i trying to say??? hmmm, michael caine goes on board with sally field and he might pick up everything he sees (diamonds)if there wasn't a telly savalas who is looking for weapons on the ship...my god, why in fact am i wasting my words on here? it's ridiculous and knowing that both field and caine were involved makes you think what went through their minds when reading scripts....certainly not diamonds....

maybe here in sydney we are all poop side down and as a result we get to lap up floaters like this s-eek!-uel in classy theaters. released here in 1980 this hilarious all-tar drama was greeted with howls of delight at the session i attended. in fact the audience were so into the ludicrous antics on screen it played like a rocky horror session. within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster: the tug boat scene where you can see the buckets of water tossed in from off-set. after that it was every patron for himself and the cinema rang with advice, cheering for bad acting and oo-waah reactions. the gunfight in the hold among the crates is especially idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states also watching to contribute appropriately. i call these films with michael caine his holiday house films as i always reckon he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his savings. like jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called.

i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels. i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, "groovy" haircuts aside, and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? having not seen the original, i guessed it might be the poseidon adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in distress. was i wrong! i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash. there is no story, the performances all looked forced, the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as sally field, michael caine, et al. they must have needed the money badly. can we blame the director?

...but other than that, there's almost no redeeming social value to this sequel to the original poseidon adventure. where the heck are all the people from the original, including the rescue crew? michael caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date (although he later trumps himself with jaws 4 down the road). slim pickens is just embarrassing as a stereotyped texas, and generally you just have to wonder, "why did they bother?" irwin allen's last stab at cashing in on the disaster craze, i guess.

being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote, i actually watched this abomination from start to finish (how many people can say that? and for any who can - what's your excuse?). my god, has there ever, ever been such a total mess released by a major studio? there is not one second of genuine tension in a supposed "thriller"; the script is inept and ludicrous; the sets look like they were leftovers from a low-budget tv movie; and the cast ... what were they thinking?!!! sally field gives what is without doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of any academy award winner in history. her irritating nasal whine and stupidly perky behaviour in what is meant to be a life-threatening situation are truly asinine. it's a wonder she didn't use all her future earnings to buy up and destroy every print of this turkey. michael caine, who now pontificates endlessly on the art of screen acting - even running master classes for would-be thespians - should be taken out and shot (preferably by one of telly savalas' henchmen). angela cartwright, an actress i usually like (and whose name isn't even in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years too old for her role, and her horrible matronly yellow prom dress must haunt her nightmares to this day. slumming it are karl malden and shirley knight - hopefully they collected a big pay packet to assuage their involvement. the whole film is a series of bad scenes, but one that especially sticks in my mind is the explosion which results in the "ceiling" (if an upside-down ship's deck can be termed as such) collapsing and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through! ooh, how scary! really, really, terrible.

stodgy drama starring pat o'brien as a washed-up reporter who turns up at his ex-boss's house to ask for money to fund his son's operation, only to find him dead on the floor. since o'brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs. a decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises, twists and turns, even though it really doesn't. performances are rotten across the board, the movie dresses itself up as a hard-boiled american noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesn't work, and the story is hardly gripping. and it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time.

a washed up reporter called bart crosbie (pat o' brien) blackmails gang boss heinz webber (george colouris) for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation. in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor, whom the gang killed in order to prevent an incriminating story being printed about them.typical poverty-row b-pic of the time directed for far more than it's worth by terence fisher, who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio. the script is far-fetched and teen idol tommy steele (guitar in hand) was drafted in to sing a poor rock and roll number called "the rebel" at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the gang's activities.

another eli roth in the making. self promoting, bad script writing excuse for a horror director. victor is as far from the new horror icon as mary poppins (reference to the disney score). what is going on here? you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all through it. can this even be called horror? horrible, yes, but horror is a stretch. david lynch should sue them for stealing the elephant man prosthetics. please stop these fan boy want to be directors now. the video directors already have enough competition breaking into the film industry. getting online and talking about how great your movie is does not make it true. stop the insanity. i work in the industry and yes these films are fun to work on, but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch.

this movie is one of the worse examples of hype. people who read imdb comments might be tempted to view this total waste of time, as i was, by false tag-lines like " a throwback to 80's horror" and what-not. this movie sucks, from the acting to the directing to the story. horrible, all across the board. and i really like good horror films, i am not at all a snob. this sucked. for reference, i loved the grudge 1 and 2, black sheep, planet terror, texas chaisaw massacre the beginning, the others, the ring, jason x, slither, planet terror, and really hated the ring 2, texas chainsaw massacre(re-make)wolf creek, the hills have eyes(re-make)hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. gore doesn't trump fun or originality.

i don't understand what the big hype was about this film. all the horror sites were saying that this movie had all the essentials of an 'old american slasher' flick that it would satisfy your needs. -- even though this was similar to an old american slasher flick, my needs were still not satisfied.my big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000's, not the 1980's. 1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past. horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic. even though they are fun to watch, they don't offer the same realistic blood thirsty gore that the recent films offer.hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic, and down-right awful. if we wanted to watch an old american slasher flick, i can just go back to the friday the 13th series, nightmare on elm street series, or the halloween series. i must admit, the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released but it is among the worst. the jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible.i would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.

i first heard of this movie at the "flashback weekend" in chicago 2007 for the "nightmare on elm street". robert englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of "hatchet". the same can be said for tony todd. knowing this is a low budget first time director / writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden "holloween" (2007) remake/re-imagining.technically it falls short in a couple of places. the alligator attack seen was shoot too dark. when it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants became almost invisible. the mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. and just like "holloween" (2007) someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer. the ending, well, as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen, not very original.the highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. unlike "holloween" (2007) we got to meet the people and care what happened to them. ben (joel moore, who is also the lead of "spiral")the sulking lead and marcus ("not another teen movie")as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie. shapiro (joel murry "dharma & greg"), jenna (joleigh fioreavanti) and misty (mercedes mcnab of "buffy the vampire slayer: the series", "angel: the series" and "the addams family" movies) give a convoluted reason for topless women. mr. and mrs. permatteo played by television regulars (richard riehle "grounded for life", patrika darbo "step by step")as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance, even the tour guide shawn (parry shen) is a fleshed out character. i hope to see more from all involved in this film, but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater, sorry.

harry knowles has a quote right on the front cover of the dvd stating"the next icon of horror" really?!?!?!? i have heard a lot of hype surrounding this one but wasn't totally convinced. however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance. no matter the budget or the rating cause ya never know where your gonna find the next gem. not here.not hatchet. hatchet is poorly conceived,poorly acted and un funny. just because you have the actors who played freddy jason and candyman and a buffy chic topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horror.sorry. i don't even want to describe the plot because it is so idiotic. honestly my money is on rob zombie. there is a man who knows old school horror. forget this trash.

in the only act of commonsense they have ever made, the nsw film & television office refused to fund this film. the producers kicked up a big stink & in a blaze of publicity took their production to victoria. apart from the lost work for technicians, nsw were lucky not to have been involved...the film fails on just about every level. the post modernism fails, the casting fails (what is rose byrne's character all about ? which 1 dimensional snarling nasty did hugo weaving channel ? what the hell is pia miranda's character doing?) and the story is a clichéd mess of contradictions. in fact, the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line.it might have had a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought out and executed. if the casting was quirkier, if the style was less serious ... if just about everything was different. apart from the usual excellence in costume, design & cinematography (like most australian films), the film is just a total miscue. at a reported budget in excess of $7m, "the tender hook" is a symptom of the malaise of the australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded. compare this mess with "noise" (under $2m), or "cedar boys" (under $1m) and you get the idea. the tough, interesting films are struggling for funding and the flabby, overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks.the funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as hugo weaving's character at the end of the film.

the tender hook, or, who killed the australian film industry? case no. 278. this sorry excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential  rose byrne, pia miranda, hugo weaving, in a jazz-era gangster drama  and turns it into a sloppily paced and executed soporific. mcheath (weaving) is a boxing promoter and gangster and functioning illiterate; for no apparent reason he's given to singing bob dylan and leonard cohen songs before bouts. how post-modern. how stupid. anyway. there's a boxer, art (matthew le nevez), who becomes mcheath's latest protégé, over his unfortunately aboriginal stablemate alby (luke carroll).mcheath's flapper moll iris (byrne) makes the goo-goo eyes at him. sexual tension squelches under the surface. miranda plays daisy, a friend of iris's (these flower girls stick together) who keeps turning up in scenes unannounced. they practice dancing together and talk about "hooking up" with guys. in the 1920s. i stopped counting anachronisms after that. there's a subplot involving japanese beer and a backstory of broome pearl fishermen. i don't know what it was all about. for some reason that is not exactly (at all) explained, byrne puts cocaine in art's lemonade. mcheath thinks he's a drunk and sacks him. byrne plots and schemes to help him out again. she's a big one for the plotting and scheming. most of which causes trouble. mcheath's two gunsels, portly ronnie (john batchelor) and russian donnie (tyler coppin), debate bumping off mcheath when he realises their part in one of iris's schemes, but ronnie wimps out when he sees mcheath crying. a lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the road of the film finally ending.director jonathan ogilvie spends a lot of time working with cinematographer geoffrey simpson creating some pretty images, but utterly fails to generate a sense of style, which might have compensated for and decorated the wispy, pathetically underpowered script; unfortunately ogilvie's sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposition, is stunningly incompetent. in an early scene, daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. how she got there, and indeed who she is, seems to have slipped ogilvie's mind. there are many more examples of this sloppiness. where he chases poetic sparseness, he achieves only wan irritation. he gains awkward performances from actors who are normally reliable, badly miscasting weaving and leaning on byrne's ability to project a kind of haunted doll-like humanity whilst saddling her with an incomprehensible character.it might not matter so much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plotting preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with witlessly sprinkled pop-culture quotes. but it doesn't. it's boring.

whenever i see a video like this, i have to ask myself how it was financed. hbo or showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions -- to hire someone who may or may not actually speak english to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot, to pay strippers with terrifying boob jobs to bounce up and down on grossly waxed dudes' torsos, to find people to design and light sets, to purchase the rights to cheesy techno music, etc. but i have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for whoever's serving as executive producer... he had to have nailed all of those girls, right? and bro's not wrong about the "spanish looking" girl, but to call the cops "stunning" is awfully generous. in fact, i'd go so far as to call them something much closer to "hideous," or "fugly." watching these women writhe around -- sometimes *clearly* high on pain killers -- was so far from erotic that my testicles actually ascended inside of my body. gross.why waste time with this when there's so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet? i wonder whether the popularization of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry... one can only hope, right?

there's nothing wrong with softcore but this one is pretty clinical - lots of nudity but it's all fake (of course, it's always fake - it's a movie but you know what i mean). there's no sexuality or erotica, it's all random nudity and poor acting of "lust" and sex with each other.part of it is of course, your personal preference. these women clearly have some body issues with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that overly plastique & leathery look so if that's your thing - great, you get to see all that here.i don't think anyone's expectations are very high when looking at a movie title such as this but for many people, it would be pretty much like looking at cyborg fembots ... they almost seem real but it's really more creepy.

it is amazing what you can see if you wake at 2 am and turn on the telly. i didn't know they showed films like this. i immediately thought of roger corman, who reused locations for movies or used other films locations for his own movies.the makes of this film could just move the camera angles and add some time and they would have an xxx film.there was no story, just minimum dialog that led to stripping and sex. i bet there wasn't 100 words in the whole film, but there sure was a lot of very large busts and hot lesbian action. there was male/female action too, but it was only about 25% of the movie.another interesting thing came to mind in watching this film that may interest those who are buying hi def dvds. sony refused to license betamax to adult film makers and adult films came out on vhs. you can guess what happened to beta max as the adult film industry makes millions of videos. sony has again refused to license blu-ray to the adult film industry and they have just signed a deal with toshiba. you can guess which high def system will disappear.

"air bud 2: golden receiver" is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year. the first film was cute, cuddly and charming. the idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched, but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept. even the human story had some explanation to it. josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad. and the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.now for the poorly made sequel. it is terrible. this is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones. the kind that changes the main plot piece in one way, this time, the k-9 plays football instead of basketball. no madder how much time is spent in mind over matter, benefit of a doubt, walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.the sequel stars kevin zegers as josh, who is in eight grade. he lives with his mother and little sister in a seattle suburb. in the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident, which the audience can relate to, most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one. in this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. josh's mother is dating once again. he and buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like this at all. why? if i were in his shoes i would love to have an extra parent in my life, especially one this nice. the man's name is patrick sullivan, and josh's mother, jackie, met him became he is a local veterinarian for buddy.the animal story is too simple. josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team, the timber wolves. the team itself looks like something from america's funniest home videos, the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other. so when bud shows up one day, he proves he can play as a receiver for them, and is no doubt the team's best player.buddy's extremely cute in his football costume. oh, he is enough to melt the heart. the dog is the best in this movie as well. too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.there is a very bad sub-plot about russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals, of course they try to catch buddy. but their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a "home alone" scenario to them."air bud 2: golden receiver" is much more goofy than the first too. the russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that, i have to admit made me laugh, at the stupidity of it all. there are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football.the performances were also quite the embarrassment. i liked gregory harrison and robert costanzo's presentations, but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a d+. kevin zegers and cynthia stevenson were absolutely pathetic.there were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers, but that isn't even worth mentioning. will children enjoy this movie? perhaps, but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep. they will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in, and loath over the fast changing script, and protest against the boring performances, and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al "air bud," as i did.i suppose that they will think the dog is adorable.

this is without a doubt the worst sequel i have ever seen, & i've seen plenty of them to make that conclusion. the plot is simply ridiculous. i can catch a ball & run around a field, too. why can't i play in the superbowl? yes i know this movie was intended for children, but there are just some plots that even children can realize are totally dumb & unrealistic. the first air bud movie was pretty good, but this one was a total crash. disney is loosing it. if i controlled who won the razzie awards, i would give this one a couple. have a nice day! =)

[warning: some spoilers included, though it is a documentary.]i bought this documentary because i like the work of the directors d.a. pennebaker and chris hegedus, which includes moon over broadway, startup.com and the war room., all terrific documentaries i would highly recommend. watching this ultimately boring and uninsightful account from depeche mode's 1988 tour, i realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together. the band members were certainly less than forthcoming on-camera; hence, undoubtedly, the contest to add fans on a one-week bus trip was added to liven things up a bit. really, now, i mean, c'mon. who thought a concert film of a synth-pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? granted, i like depeche mode's music, and martin gore writes good melodies, but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting, and this movie is proof positive. unless you are a huge fan of depeche mode, stay away from this documentary....it's a complete waste of time.

as a massive fan of dm, it goes without saying that i have seen this film numerous times. however, i watch it purely for the concert footage...the rest of the film is, um, pretty dreadful, sad to say.famed rock music film director da pennebaker followed mode around on their late 80s music for the masses tour, which promoted the superb album of the same name. the title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the pasadena bowl, but is also a reference to the movie being a 'beginners course' on the band and how it ticks ie depeche mode 101. amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring america is a second story thread covering a group of dm fans who've won a competition to meet the band, go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig.now, as i said above, the concert footage is great. mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s. though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece "violator", there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg behind the wheel, the majestic never let me down again, everything counts, just can't get enough from the vince clarke years, shake the disease and many more.when mode are onstage, they are brilliant. when they are not, they're, well, very boring. nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the us in the dying days of the reagan administration. as an example, the probable "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. not exactly thrilling stuff. i know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the mormon tabernacle choir look like rammstein.the only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band's lead singer dave gahan. gahan comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic, talking about a violent power inside himself he can't control, recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. there's one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage - truly embarrassing. the man clearly had issues back then, which thankfully have been resolved. songwriter martin gore and keyboardist andy fletcher are presented as very articulate, clearly massively talented, but also utterly colourless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member alan wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb.and as for the 'fan tour' thread, well it's unwatchable dross. let's not kid ourselves. maybe it's just because it's all so *very* late 80s, but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation. they are, to a person, singularly shallow and vapid people, whose antics are banal when they aren't hide-your-face cringeworthy. let me reiterate....*nothing* happens in the footage that isn't onstage that is of any interest. nothing. endless scenes of kids spraying their hair, arguing pointlessly, changing their clothes, getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing - if cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in '88/89. the love the youngsters have for the band is something i can definitely relate to, and is at times infectiously joyous, but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them, then i'd hate to see the outtakes.but the music is all that matters, and in this regard 101 excels. the pasadena concert, one of their all time best gigs, makes the film worth seeing. the recent dvd edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage (a good 80% of the performance), and thus makes the dvd an absolute must for fans. the audio commentary by the band (minus wilder, who left mode in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also, oddly, far more interesting than the film itself.as a document of the boys from basildon during their amphitheatre idol period, depeche mode 101 is invaluable. but if you're looking for excitement, you're better off getting the accompanying double live album (now available in super audio cd format).

the plane is a 747 jumbo. the cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747. in the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit. they walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors into the cockpit. what a gaff !!! the front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a tv screen. beyond that is the radar dome. before takeoff a 747 is shown to commence the taxi to the runway. on take-off the plane is shown to have only two engines. areal 747 has four engines. who was in charge of continuity on this movie ? during the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets - another farcical gaff !!! after that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice-versa. at this point i stopped watching. absolute rubbish!!!

i would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs i got out of it. some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh!! how could some one have actually talked like this. not to mention the fact that the bodyguard majors (antonio sabato jr.) flew a 747 like a pro and michael pare's team of whiners were able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge boulder in the nick of time. did anyone notice the lame tribute to "fantasy island" with the guy saying "boss, the plane!!" to michael pare just as the 747 comes in sight.the only saving grace were the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers. not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker!! imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a "crossbow". hello.the poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and having rum!! just for laughs, they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a category 3 hurricane on neptune atoll. did i hear michael pare calling it the "best honeymoon resort in the pacific." now that would make an interesting movie!!

maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like 'airplane' but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a 'thriller'. i don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice. hell, i would have done it for free! this magical aircraft managed to morph from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backward. and the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of 'telephone' where everyone spoke different languages. i actually rewound the tivo and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as i thought at first. it was.

i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one, "plan 9 from outerspace", "side hackers" and the dreaded "blair witch project" there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn't believable.let's start with an amtrak train with no skirts or handrails between cars. the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train.in one scene a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment. he wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? he turns up her stereo! if i heard my stereo suddenly get louder i'd be concerned. he kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. i was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in. plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted.the boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me. first the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasn't on the top deck of the plane. i watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (where was the flight engineer?) walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward toward's the nose of the airplane.i was also amazed that bullets wouldn't penetrate an aluminum serving cart (good thing for our hero), or bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage. huh? watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well.i didn't check, was this a movie of the week or something? it was terrible.

you have to see this. i could not stop laughing about the stupidities i saw in this movie even late after the event. there is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie. the acting is bad. the story is so predictable and flat. the effects are like 50 years old. the supposed thriller is nowhere. you will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it. we had a great time after the movie. truly. me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next oscar winner. sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen.

my suggestion..... this movie was really intended to be a "comedy",wasn't it?!!!! if not, the producers, directors, actors & "hair stylists" should really choose another career! now, the guidelines of my submission requires a minimum of "10 lines". how in the world can i add any more to this? hmm...let me see. oh yes, the beginning of the movie was quite hilarious with the "crash landing" scene. too bad that the plane didn't hit the tanker truck & a bunch of "martians" would have scrambled out from the wreckage (obviously hiding) and decided to take over the "world" planet and make a better movie. now, that would have been a great beginning!t

i can't believe that someone actually paid to have this film made. stupid, unrealistic, and stereotypical. right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed. then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. the acting was just horrid and forced. there just didn't seem to be any direction. i have seen some pretty horrid b movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film i was extremely disappointed.

the idea that anyone could of concocted such a trite, cliché, yet indeliberately comical movie is shocking. the final 20 minutes of this film are comical glory; with six men digging enough trench in 10 minutes to light the runway with gasoline for a 747, while a supposed 'major' perfectly lands the 747 in a 110mph crosswind - leading one to question the misnomer of calling this movie crash landing...some of the dialogue was equivalent to rubbing sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that saved this movie for a 1 was the plethora of attractive women filling the screen a large portion of the time. not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic excuse of a movie, but my mute button finally received a workout.view at your own risk! 2 out of 10

hilarious!! i would have sworn ed wood wrote this. terrible. i loved every frame. bad movie aficionado's, this is your trophy! i will watch it again. words cannot explain how entertaining this movie is. pare's career must have dipped low, but i really think he's heading in the leslie nielson direction. he was perfect for this. terrible, just terrible!! you'll love it!! get some friends, lots of beer, and you'll have the time of your life. it's an mst3000 party, waiting to happen. enjoy!! it is worth the rental!! you like the "colombo type" cop and the comic relief coroner. the bad guy will have you on the floor laughing. he's also in another pare movie, komodo vs cobra, and he's just as good there. i don't know what the budget was but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year.

aghhhhhh! what a disappointment. a perfectly good hunk like antonio sabato jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth. i cringed at 95% of the dialog! it would have been better to have made the character a mute! how antonio sabato and michael pare could speak those lines without losing control of some bodily function is beyond me! if michale pare's character prefaced or ended just one more sentence with the word 'men' i think i would have thrown the iron through the tv set (i love to multitask - especially to get through bad movies). must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie. washing cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now. and the bad guy......if he was so bad why didn't he just shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. even the title was a misnomer. a 'crash landing' means the plane actually crashes and doesn't just land without even a token fire or anyone being injured. instead of landing safely the plane should have crashed and burned just like the script.this movie is a stinker !

this movie is so bad it's worth seeing. this movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes. it all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast. however, they know it's been done before many times so to make it different, let's do it very badly! major masters has his name pirated from 80's movie "to live and die in l.a." from character played by willem dafoe. that saved 10 minutes in writing and production time. the plane is supposed to be a boieng 747. that plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top. just ask the late ronald reagan who lamented this point when them ruskies shot down kal 007 in the eighties. yet when the plane takes off it's clearly not a 747 looks more like a 767. this well researched film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats. no need for a flight engineer on this complex plane! heroine is played by perpetually pouting gloria lynn berg. after tying up the hijacker, despite several bus-loads of people on this jumbo jet, nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them. he's just forced to amuse himself.the crippled plane, leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans won't make it back to hawaii so masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island. only the runway's 300 feet too short! four army guys with little bobcats (the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn), are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes! no need for a bulldozer here! where can you find guys like this? these guys could make a highway between los angeles and las vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons, a compass and a duck!after that hellish obstacle is fixed, masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away. hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble. he is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that i can't tell you. but, can you say moby dick?there are so many retarded scenes in this movie. the wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while masters, who supposedly can barely fly, puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute drops. the pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but doesn't budge an inch. i think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts, this moving could have been way better. if we need a pouting heroine in the movie, why not pick better known actress bernadette peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well? besides, she can sing and the busty well aging peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots. now with the singing angle this could be a hijacking, let's land the plane movie musical! cast luciano pavarotti as the pilot. they can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and there's no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as masters works his magic on that big bird. in keeping with the musical theme, masters could then be played by andrei bocelli, that peters can sing with as he lands the plane. not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of english. now that's a plot! think of the edge of your seat conversation between masters (bocelli) and the air traffic controller:atc: "sir, please throttle back to 180, flaps set to 25 degrees. maintain 230 heading"bocelli: "what?"atc: "sir, arm spoilers now, confirm brake pressure at 250 psi. maintain descent at 500 fpm"bocelli: "what?"the hijacker could have been played by the late great rodney dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded: "i get no respect. my wife is into group sex. yeah, she screwed me in front of the judge and jury!" get the idea?missed opportunities the movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed. woody allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues: "she said i was great in bed. i told her i practice myself a lot..." now this is a movie!also, according to similar movie "executive decision" where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance, 747's have massive attics up top. the plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there? my uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all sorts of stuff in his. wouldn't it have been cool if masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed chevy chase in a woman's housecoat watching old super 8 movies of his childhood? just a recommendation.so give it a chance, and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it...

i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here. i saw the whole movie by fast forwarding and ended in 25 minutes. though its a low budget movie it could have been made better. the movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately. and why was the movie named "crash landing" when it was landed so well in such a bad climate. without any acting, all the characters where just moving or doing like kids.and should not forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker who would have been more suitable if this movie was a full time comedy.

this film was embarrassing in its clichés, poor acting and generally low production values. it starts out badly with the long haired 3 star general calling the hero, masters, "major" when he is obviously wearing the silver oak leaves of lieutenant colonel. but what was most distressing was the crew of soldiers on neptune atoll. how out of touch with any kind of reality can you get? they were all experts on flying a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond comical.warning: this film is dangerous to your intellectual health! watch at your own peril!

i gave this film a 2 mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so (insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet)-ing pointless that i felt bad that at the time i voted for it its lowest vote was a three.very predictable plot....two nare-do-well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems. however when a friend leaves a bag full of money (that belongs to drug dealers) in their care they of course spend it and then the "fun" begins.not an original idea in this whole film.

if you're not a fan of the 80s, and you need to be a particularly strong fan, or of one of the two leads, there's nothing about this film to recommend.the story, as others have said, is dull, almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy. i watched it to about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no... it's not unwatchable, it's just dull. it goes by. it goes by with bits of running around madly, lingering shots of feet at strange angles, bits of shouting madly but i didn't get a real feel of energy or manic fun, it just came across as forced. needless to say also, there was nothing to laugh at particularly. a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more.don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way, all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female. if anything, it's actually cloying... two female leads, fine, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, their landlord is a landlady, alright, their friends are female, okay, the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building, oh, female... i wasn't on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt, again, a bit forced and cloying.on the plus-side, if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture, there is plenty to see and if you're a fan of helen slater, she's fun and enjoyable to watch. there's also some screen-time for carol kane, which is great, but not enough...overall: 3/10. if you're a huge fan of the 80s, helen slater and carol kane, you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them, although there's still the fact it's a comedy which isn't funny, which hinders it substantially. if you're not a fan of those things, you might as well make it 0 because there's nothing much else to enjoy here.

i want to say that i went to this movie with my expectations way too high. i thought it was going to be funny because it's the sequel to bruce almighty which was really funny and it stars steve carell who is an excellent comedic actor but boy, did it sucked.the movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people reprising their roles are morgan freeman and steve carell but steve's character is completely different, he is no longer the jerk he was in the first one here he is a nice guy. the story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny.all the actors involved(steve carell, morgan freeman, wanda sykes, john goodman, ed helms and even jon stewart in a very crappy cameo) have talent but none of them seems to use it and it looks that there in the movie just for the money.now the plot is obviously shaped after noah's story but there are so many wrong things with it, i don't know where to start. i guess the big problem is that in the everyone around evan thinks that he is crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all around the world, he builds a giant arc in a few weeks, in real life people wouldn't be mocking these guy after that, they would be saying he is the new noah.also the special effects are good but what the hell is the greatest movie flood ever filmed doing in evan almighty? did they really had to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie.jim carrey seems to be a smart guy since he has stayed away of three of the worst sequels ever made, son of the mask, dumb and dumbered and now evan almighty.this was a giant disappointment and tom shyadac should be ashamed of himself.

this film is definitely up there with the worst films i've ever seen, probably in my top 5 of worst films. i laughed once and that was when:evan: "im building something" evan's secretary: "i hope its a barber shop"that was literally the only time i laughed in this 'comedy', awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan...wasn't even that great! this movie lacked the humour of having god's powers and was more about family bonding. id class it solely as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. seeing a bird poo on someone's shirt is not hilarious, neither is a beard that grows back instant!i didn't even think the special effects were great, the animals looked really stuck on, it was like watching a film which hadn't been 'glued' together properly2/10 film - avoid!

evan almighty (2007) ** steve carell, morgan freeman, lauren graham, johnny simmons, graham phillips, jimmy bennett, john goodman, wanda sykes, john michael higgins, jonah hill, molly shannon, ed helms, (cameo: jon stewart as himself) strained 'sequel' to "bruce almighty" with carell's jerk anchorman evan baxter leaving tv to begin his stint as a freshman congressional rep has his hands full when god (freeman reprising his holy role; jim carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have). the godforsaken sitcom-y script by steve oedekerk, joel cohen & alec sokolow is absolutely lame and only carell's amiable persona transcends his vain evan into something resembling a human being. the end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 m for the cgi f/x). sykes steals the show as evan's sarcastic assistant. sacrilegiously unfunny. (dir: tom shadyac)

was this supposed to be funny? this is one of those films that just doesn't work. the first one, bruce almighty with jim carey, had some very funny moments. this one had none.steve carrell, who was brilliant in bruce almighty, fails to deliver here. his performance is very ordinary and he can't carry it off like carey did.the one good thing about this is i only paid $1.95 to rent it. it's a movie for children...very young children who have only seen about 4 films or so in their short lives.it's interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it's usually a huge turkey. anyone remember son of mask? (imdb worst 100 films of all time) avoid this one movie lovers.

evan almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise, this time with newsman turned freshman congressman from buffalo, evan baxter (steve carell), at it's center. a wholly innocuous (and not even really self-doubting) man, god (morgan freeman) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon baxter, in order to illustrate the importance of... reciprocal kindness, so that baxter can "change the world" (aka, pay it forward).think of evan almighty as a wholesome derivative of 'distinguished gentlemen.' baxter is not a con, but his colleague, congressman long (john goodman) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially, is harmful to the environment. and well-meaning baxter, knowing the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support him. in addition, with the new job comes more responsibility, and baxter is in a sense, vilified, for not spending enough time with his family. so god, decides to give evan baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day noah. his orders: build an ark. except, while it may be mildly humorous to see baxter's transformation to the "weirdo with a beard-o," there doesn't seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles. (spoilers: if none of the population is killed by the "flood", then what was the point of summoning the animals... or at least the ones that obviously weren't from suburban virginia? or, more importantly, if all baxter had to realize was that long's projects faltered in their quality, then why did he have to build an ark?).so, although a comedy like this needn't be a hysterical laugh-riot, it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies (and not all from morgan freeman) and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events.

the creative team behind evan almighty really should have been able to make a better film. starring one of america's favourite funnymen and helmed by ace ventura pet detective director tom shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides. hell even steve oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious barnyard, and attains a writing credit here has done better work. the fact of the matter is that evan almighty isn't the worst picture of the summer season but it might well be the most disappointing. the title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003's bruce almighty. that picture had jim carrey in the lead, and whilst both steve carell and carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material. i've heard that carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor declined staing he saw no other places for his character to venture. thus shadyac moved over to carell, who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom. after sleeper hits the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine the man has become big business, and so it's him rather than rubber faced jim who leads this production into theatres. the story see's evan baxter (steve carell) having been elected as a congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so evan can find success with his job. his wife (lauren graham) and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards evan, who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes. however things start to go belly up fairly fast, god (morgan freeman) appears to evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an ark. initially ignoring the encounter, evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two. evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren't happy and neither is a fellow politician (john goodman). anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of tom shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie. ace ventura, liar liar and hell even bruce almighty where largely very funny pictures, but all of those ;projects have one thing in commen and thats jim carrey's presence. shadyac hasn't made a worthwhile film without carrey at the helm, he's worked with robin williams, eddie murphy and now steve carell, but still only carrey seems to meld successfully with shadyac. carell after the disappointing box-office and critical mauling won't be desperate to work with the director again, and with carrey now doing more serious projects shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast. carell himself is fairly dull here, whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie (despite being quite amusing) deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot. i expect after bruce almighty's box-office draw it was universal studios themselves, but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud, and thats exactly the case with evan almighty. lauren graham isn't any great shakes as evan's wife nor do any of the children strike the right note. freeman lets it all hang loose as god in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece. indeed the most consistent source of laughter is evan's secretary (wanda sykes) and creep co-worker (jonah hill), both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. oedekerk's writing has been worse (barnyard) but also better (ace ventura when nature calls) than his work on this production. his script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough. the film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds, indeed the opening church sequence in the simpsons movie shakes religion harder than evan almighty's whole 95 minute run. with a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture. i don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film, but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question. there's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile, a line that evan almighty is always on the wrong side off. maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch, but i can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy.

i was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend..john was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looks great with no shirt on!! i thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters. savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him i lost respect for her. she said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard - he was the one a million miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters!!! she didn't have it hard, she had family & money and he had a tour of duty!! i was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her - he was too much of a sweetheart. i would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms.

the only reason i rated this film as 2 is because channing tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch. usually i adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time, i didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all. i'm no film critic but i just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see channing tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it (not that his acting was any good) i would have stopped watching much quicker. it's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker. .. if you're looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night in...give this one a miss!!

i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in "dear john," but it was very slow moving; and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers. i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels. ironically, i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.the cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters, focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter. i felt that channing tatum became bogged down in what became a very "hang-dog" series of expressions in response to loss.

this movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, nicholas sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as the notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in mcadams and gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of channing tatumi felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance, a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, amanda seyfried given a great performance only to have tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover.this story deserved to be cast right, but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act. tatum should stick to what hes good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like gi joe, step up, and fighting. the less he talks the better.try not to think of me as a jaded hater of channing tatum i went in to this movie with an open mind, because i've been surprised many a time by the likes of adam sandler in reign over me. i gave the same chance to tatum i didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just by his performance in this movie, which sadly was a letdown

having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie. i read the book again. it is one of my favorite nicholas sparks books. what i think what makes the story is the relationships. that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles (tim's and alan's characters). the movie didn't at all capture john and savannah's relationship. maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie, but i thought it was so dull compared to the book. i thought channing was a great pick for john,but i had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it, so i think it was more geared towards them. the ending cuts the whole point of the book out so i was also unhappy with that. i was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. i do feel like i wasted a friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story, not at all the story i was expecting to see.

rarely have i seen a work of literature translated so badly to the screen. the hysterical cast of b-movie and sitcom extras simply make the characters seem like bad jewish stereotypes. the worst of all is melissa gilbert, who you hate from scene one and never develop any sympathy for. performances like this should be noted and used against actors who wish to work again. all in all, a seedy, low-budget made-for-tv film of the sort that gives made-for-tv films a bad name.

this is truly a re-make that should never have gotten out of the stable. it has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata. at the top of their game are joan plowright and maximillian schell. every nuance of the franks is in plain sight. at the rock bottom are melissa gilbert and doris roberts. i cannot imagine how schell and plowright manage to play so well when gilbert and roberts are working their anti-magic. gilbert ruins every scene she's in. it's like father knows best in the ghetto. she's ann frank light. her run at helen keller was thin but not awful. this is sacrilege. doris roberts makes mrs. van damm merely annoying. she is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious, dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in het acherhuis. this needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to voluptuous. her weight is not the problem. joan plowright could have played this part beautifully. roberts was on a career high when this was made, getting lots of press and many opportunities. her performance here displays her weaknesses as an actress shamefully.james coco and clive reville, have most of their scenes with gilbert and roberts , and , strong though they are, they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners. reville is a wily actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by ed wynne in the original film. he gets no support from gilbert . she drain the color out of every scene. i've read with dismay the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version, filled with attachment to these performances. it's a lesson in how the version you see first attachs to you. it makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products i loved in my childhood. i encourage you to watch the original. it has very few weak spots and it's head and shoulders above this mess.

i saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars shelley winters and millie perkins and no matter how many times i watch it, i can't help but not to cry.this version was (obviously) a set, like the 1959 was, but there were so many mistakes in layout. spiral staircase? items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film. doris roberts, sad to say cannot play drama, she a comedic actress and that will not change. james coco was a horrible mr. van daan and mr. dussel resembled a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play. in the original film, anne walked the "gauntlet" to go to peter's room, that seemed to take her more then a minute. in this crappy remake, it took her under 10 seconds. the first reviewer was correct... this remake is just that, a remake. what was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that. i'm sorry but james coco cannot play drama. max.. schell was better in deep impact then this movie. the cranky mrs. frank was just that cranky, i couldn't stand her. referencing and comparing to the 1959 version, i like her better, she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. out of 10 stars, i give this remake 3. don't waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of kleenex.

as a devotee of ms. frank, i remember being so excited that the play was being re-made for tv. that is, until i saw it... this film is a prime example of how important casting is, and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose. the casting of any central role is crucial to a production of this sort...shows like auntie mame and man of la mancha are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor. and in the cast of this movie, the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of melissa gilbert in the lead role. there is not one single moment that ms. gilbert even comes close to inhabiting the sensitive, mature spirit of anne- ms. gilbert is "white-bread" throughout the movie... the only time i was close to tears was during the reading of anne's most haunting line: "i still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart"- this is spoken by ms. gilbert so rushed, so lacking in conviction, that she might has well burped and achieved the same effect. film and dance legend marge champion was the dialogue coach for this production- she should have refunded her salary! despite ms. gilbert ruining diary, other performances are satisfactory for the most part- special kudos to joan plowright as edith, scott jacoby as peter and clive reville as mr. dussell. maxmillian schell does not have the deep-rooted soul and spirit as otto as does the creator of the role on stage and film(joseph schildkraut), but he's okay. doris roberts and james coco as the van danns are relatively superficial in their parts- they're shrill and bombastic, but again, only on the surface. this could be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushed(as noted in previous postings)- this film clocks in 45 minutes shorter than the film version- the difference owing to the pauses for dramatic effect, which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate mood for the story. this is not mandatory viewing, especially for youngsters learning about anne frank for the first time- stick to the original film version, and or even better, the tv production of anne frank: the true story starring ben kingsley, which is the closest thing to capturing the heartbreak and reality of anne's situation ever filmed! note: especially appalling is the fact that melora marshall, who plays anne's sister margot, is not included in the opening credits along with all the other members of the secret annex... she's listed in the post-credits along with the actors playing miep and mr. kraler. if i was ms. marshall, i would have sued!

if this awful film moved at a snails pace it would at least be moving.watching grass grow would be more interesting. it was painful to sit through and i only stayed in the theatre to see how all the cruel teens would die.where is brian depalma????

following up the 1970s classic horror film carrie with this offering, is like ford following the mustang with the edsel. this film was horrendous in every detail. it would have been titled beverly hill 90210 meets mystery science theater 3000, but both of those shows far exceed this tripe. this film was scarcely a horror film. i timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of lame high school hazing and ritual. wow, what a surprise, carrie's weird friend commits suicide! wow, carrie misconstrues her love interests affections! wow, the in-crowd sets up carrie! wow, the jocks have a sexual scoring contest! what this film needed was way more action and far less tired teen cliches. this film is totally unviewable.

ok, i did think that it would be horrible. but when i saw it.. i was proven wrong. emily bergl did a superb job as did jason london. sue snell was under-used and under-written. the meanies were ok, dylan bruno and rachel blanchard are definitely the stand-outs. as for the things the teens do and how people claim it's all wrong. whatever. my friends and i use the term "swank" a lot and i have driven a car and had someone steer as i changed. it's pretty much all there. i've just never been at a after-game party in a house that big with it's very own light show.. the deaths are good. the best involves a pair of glasses, a spear gun and a pool.. all in that order. i must say, there will be people who hate it.. but i'm not one of them.

i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes (i'm working on it ;) )the stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors (insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings) and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better. just the typical slasher-genre with in this case very odd action. many by-plays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark, create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere hazily. for sure its an hit for slasher-fans but not for me. but although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out well.so not the best one...

think of this film as fan service, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. we start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: the virginal mandy lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. so.. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. the only other company is a hunky ranch-hand who may or may not be suffering from gulf war syndrome. hmm... potential future suspect maybe?so as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man isn't the first to die. there are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. even down to the so-called shocking twist at the end, the movie is like an old 80's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds.unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. people get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, bang they're brown bread. rinse, then repeat. maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer. until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the i.q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. oh well.. 4/10

looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me to believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please just about any brain dead idiot. this movie is beyond useless. all the cliché's of a slasher film without any substance. i am sure i could go in to details about the movie but why bother when you can sum it up? obviously everyone wants mandy lane and she apparently wants none of the guys. throughout the movie you will see this.when she stops being friends to the typical boy trapped in friend-zone loser, he goes ballistic and when she goes on a road trip to the middle of no where (of course) he begins to hunt them one by one. sounds decent so far right? but what made this movie suck beyond belief is when you find out that not only is her loser friend the killer but she is as well.. the plan was beyond ridiculous. lets together kill all our friends and then kill each other. they give no reason why they wanted to do this and given mandy lane's "goody too shoes" demeanor it makes you scratch your head even more as to what is actually motivating these characters to do anything they are doing. it's sad.. this movie had lots of potential but the director or writer apparently can't relate to the audience in anyway.

i started watching this because i was looking for a nice 'background' comedy for my sunday morning. then i noticed that this was going to be a road-movie and i decided to actually watch this.first 15 minutes were awful, but i wanted to give this a chance, because i never judge a movie without watching it throughly. then things started to get little better. this seemed like a nice road-movie about friendship.. but then the movie started to get horrible predictable cliché-twists and when the movie was over it left you feeling like you had wasted your time. did this have anything to say? why did they even make a movie like this? and i wasn't expecting a modern citizen kane, but still, i have several ideas how this movie could have been improved.so take my piece of advice; leave this alone and go watch a real road-movie. there are many of those. i won't make the directors of those movies seem bad by putting their names on this review.1/10

this movie was an all around uninspiring film. it was a non-moving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film the 3 main actors are good, and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesn't. i watched this movie last night and wished that we hadn't wasted our precious time (while baby is sleeping) watching this film. i plan not to recommend this to my family and friends, as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it. i was pretty much non-impressed with everything about this film.

unforgiven is clint eastwoods last tribute to the once great west. but whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken. unforgiven, though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that unforgiven is eastwoods worst film to date. eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film.all the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially eastwoods character. the acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. the direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. so overall unforgiven is not eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around.

and now for another point of view: i didn't like it. i didn't finish it in fact. i know that "unforgiven" is ranked by some as one of the greatest westerns ever made. i know that it stars and was directed by clint eastwood, one of the icons of american cinema. i know that it won a bunch of oscars. still, i didn't like it. i don't like westerns, and that's clearly a matter of taste, but i also don't admire eastwood's acting. he is not and never has been a leading man. he is no burt lancaster, no paul newman, no john wayne. in this film alone he is dwarfed by richard harris and gene hackman; they are both actors. no, eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. here he plays a retired tough guy. when i see him on screen, i see a man laboring at his acting. then there's the anti-western western plot. it is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women, blacks, native americans, and single parents; a disrespect for violence and drinking; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage, and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. by promoting those values, the movie comes across as mannered, if not preachy. then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold, the kid who can't shoot straight, the city slicker new to the wild west, the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords. finally there is the pacing of eastwood's direction. i gave up after an hour. eastwood was still riding north, chatting with morgan freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight, sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion. it was way too slow. somebody had to find these elements uncompelling. i am afraid it was me.

it is is very sad to see someone of the calibre of george c scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by graham greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre. not to mention a better cinematographer. there are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely glossed over, rather than captured to locate the movie solidly in the exotic setting of the novel.elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site, one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film. ever since i saw george c scott as rochester in jane eyre, i have prayed for him never to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a british accent. just every now and then, he could just possibly pass for british or a very british sounding south african played obviously by an american actor. i can stomach meryl streep's extraordinarily laboured accents (both british and australian) - at least she gets it right even though with every utterance, she demands that we marvel at her skill. well, i am sorry that mr. scott is no meryl streep, and it just destroys the illusion - like having michele yeoh speak excruciating mandarin with a strong singaporean accent in crouching tiger etc.peterson acts no differently than what we see on csi. except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie. he is the harrison ford of tv. same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. no on second thought, ford has two - perplexed/pained and happy. i have never seen a smile on mr. csi!

what is wrong with curacao ( also known as deadly currents though what the reasonn for the name change is i have no idea ) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover :" keep it down baby , i'm trying to sleep " it's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered , it's the fact the actress has has a central european accent . nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from philidelphia in the united states ! this what struck me about this thriller while watching it - the way accents don't match their characters . apart from the philly woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent , a local police chief who sounds like he's an irishman impersonating a gestapo officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone who's either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american tinged with south african . you soon give up following what's on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak . it's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie a country of origin . with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations even if you're not curious about accents or dialects you'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because curacao is plot less . things happen like a boat exploding , and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for south african intelligence but you're left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to . i was lost

"curacao" is a foreign intrigue drama set on the title caribbean island which involves a retired sea captain and bar owner (scott) and a demoted cia field operative (petersen). the film has numerous bad guys, foreign agents and thugs, skulking about the pair of protagonists all coveting something scott has which they want and are prepared to kill for. a lukewarm low budget tv flick, "curacao" is spiced up with a couple of babes and use some carnival street parades as window dressing. little more than fodder for the bored couch potato. c-

strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong context, the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and bad low brow comedy timing, the clear attempt at dry/black/dark humour is obvious and it fails to deliver on all elements of a good joke.with a high cringe factor and low laugh ratio i was shocked this show went pass the first season, i personally like scrubs, the office, 30 rock, trailer park boys, pulling, peep show, simpsons, family guy and i know what your thinking, these shows aren't weird at all, so some other good shows i've seen are jam, garth marenghi's darkplace, the book group, asylum and snuff box which are original with dry/black/dark humour/satire and are all at least 5/10.garth marenghi's darkplace especially is cheap looking, overacted and weird, however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too.

i attempted to watch this, and was highly disappointed. don't expect intelligent and insightful humor ala amy's brother david amidst this dreck... it is the polar opposite. but if you're into poop, fart and boner jokes, you'll be in seventh heaven. this is bathroom humor aimed, i assume, at those who've had several bongs, which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as "the best television writing ever." i assume that those who hate such simpleton humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review, but i am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for high-end comedy. the characters overact. the shock factor is set to 10. and the laughs are set to zero (unless, of course, you seek juvenile, low-brow humor.) i made it through 40 minutes, praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment, but alas, it just got worse and worse. and beware of amy's ever-present and hammy overbite expression - it will set your eyes rolling. it was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors i enjoy, but i can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the sedaris family.to those who loved it, i'm sorry... this is my opinion. it was so bad it inspired me to write my first review.

necessary roughness (1991) was a bad comedy/ drama that tried to hard on every level to be a serious film about college football. a lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights. other than that it's a very mediocre movie. they should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism. instead the film makers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick. when will somebody make a decent film about college football that's funny and realistic?not recommended, unless it's for free on t.v.

this movie is allegedly a comedy.so where did all the laughs go.did the forget to put them in,on the version i watched.as a football movie,it is mildly entertaining,i guess.maybe'm just a stick in the mud,with no discernible sense of humour.or maybe this movie just isn't funny.it is also annoying,with that way over the top "you're a winner"musical score.and the odd thing is,the team sucked through most of the season,only winning the last two games,and the last game meant nothing since they were not in the playoffs.so what is the point? are they celebrating mediocrity?i don't see it.if anybody knows,please let me know.anyway,this movie isn't great or even very good.i'm giving it a low 3*

this movie was on the pay channels today and i had nothing to do so i had it on. this has to be the worst football movie ever made. this has to be one of the worst movies period. the premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. this movie isn't even a half a star. bad acting, scott bakula sinks as usual, larry miller?? sinbad, couldn't act if he tried. rob schneider's one liners completely stunk. fred thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. the only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see kathy ireland nude in the shower, not even close. a complete waste of time and of film. if we could give a negative number, minus 9.

this movie was such a waste of my money. it was disgusting as well as disturbing. honestly, i would never recommend this movie to anyone. who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog?? seriously... it was a waste of my time. i kept watching the movie, hoping it would get better and a plot would emerge but that never happened. i'd rate the movie an f-. this movie should have been rated r for its disturbing nature. i would never let children of any age see this movie. this movie sucks. this movie is horrible. this movie was a waste of my time. i could have spent the night doing some worth my time instead of renting this movie. this movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store and definitely a waste of two dollars to watch it. pretty much, no one should watch this movie. this movie should be banned and burned.

well, it is a monogram quickie from the dreaded period of the '40s when poverty row studios put out a good many "horror" films that are almost unimaginably dull... so i was expecting the worst. the story concerns a doctor who has been working on a way to restore life to the dead through the use of a room full of non-utilitarian electrical devices which spark nicely. there is a dog's heart hanging under a bell jar and twitching fitfully, which we are informed is proof that his method is perfected.a brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and mention of an important plot point precede the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather undramatic sequence - undramatic even with the sparks. the important plot point is that a convicted murderer is being executed just at midnight, which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived. it is no surprise that the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesiac and with a strange desire to visit the haunts of the underworld and become acquainted with certain gangsters...it's hard to explain why this all is not completely unwatchable, but perhaps it suffices to say that it's mildly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters. towards the end it even begins to move along with a bit of real tension and a confrontation that is downright hitchcockian. spoileri have to warn of a very, very bad ending. a tagged on unnecessary, pain in the ass sorta ending. after the plot resolves rather effectively...you know the sort of thing... it's all a dream. never happened.

"black friday" did this plot so much better, which is why it is remembered and "the man with two lives" is just a forgotten potboiler. "shed no tears" was it's working title and it would have been a better one as he was a thoroughly evil character for most of the film.philip bennett is newly engaged when he is involved in a traffic accident. dr. clark (edward keene) has been involved in some experimental operations on animals - bringing them back from the dead. his colleagues urge him to try his operation on phillip, who has died. as he is operating , a dangerous criminal, wolf panino, is going to the electric chair and trans migration of the soul occurs. when phillip awakes from the operation, he has the soul of panino. he is a changed person, he is rude to his family and starts to hang around panino's old haunts. he takes over wolf's old gang - going by the name of philip bennett, he also romance's wolf's former girlfriend - who smells a rat. bennett, as wolf, is determined to even up scores and starts to eliminate his enemies.bodies pile up, including the girlfriend and a policeman, then his own family begins to fall victim.but - i hate those "bad dream" movies - you always feel let down. this film would have been better if he had stayed in character as panino and had a final shoot out. eleanor, his fiancée, would have ended up sadder but wiser with his brother. edward norris, the star, had a big career mostly in b movies.not really recommended.

"a young man, recently engaged to be married, is the victim of a traffic accident and dies as a result of his injuries. his father, desperate to revive his son, agrees to let a scientist friend try his experimental soul transmigration process to save him. after the young man returns to life, the father and fiancée notice a dark and violent change in the young man's behavior, leading them to believe something went horribly wrong in the revival process," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.at one point, edward norris (as philip bennett) is asked, "what do you think this is, boys town?" mr. norris should know, since he was in "boys town". "the man with two lives " is more like "black friday" minus karloff and lugosi. you do the math. this film might have been a contender, with a re-worked script; it does feature an intriguing final act. after a tepid "shoot out", hang in for the drama to pick up with a well-played scene between star norris and pursuing detective addison richards (as george bradley).**** the man with two lives (1942) phil rosen ~ edward norris, eleanor lawson, addison richards

as a writing teacher, there are two ending i never allow my students to use: "then i woke up" and "then i got run over by a truck." i am now going to add, "then i got a bump on the head." i feel it's utterly unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination. the whole issue of transmigration could have been handled with some intelligence and craft, yet, in this film, they either couldn't or wouldn't do that. i'm not saying it's totally worthless, but it is so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid ending. there are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy. they should have done him in immediately. it's just a forgettable, borderline horror/sci fi film, with nothing new to offer.

this started out slow, then got worse. the best parts of this were all seen in the previews.bad apple has the feel of a pilot - if that's the case tnt should save their money.

could someone please explain to me the reason for making this movie? sad is about all i can say; this movie took absolutely no direction and wound up with me shaking my head. what an awful waste of two hours. noth should be ashamed of himself for taking money for this piece of garbage.

i have just wasted my saturday night watching this crap! i saw the names of chris noth (mr. big, from "sex & the city"), robert patrick (from "x-files"), the decadent elliot gould, colm meaney and mercedes ruehl on the credit; a very reasonable imdb rating (5,6); and many good reviews in imdb. for my total surprise, the film is horrible: the characters are badly constructed; the story tries to be funny, but it is totally silly; the character of mercedes ruehl is amazingly stupid for a professor of princeton. so, i decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews, and i found that most of them are made by imdb users with only review, therefore relatives or friends of the cast and crew, or people hired to promote this garbage. my vote is three.title (brazil): "sem retorno" ("without return")

chip foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects are truly amazing. the co-hosts do a good job. i particularly enjoy watching the "project" come together. the end results are much better than when they came off the assembly line what with the mechanical and cosmetic advances of today. however, i do get annoyed somewhat at the fact the "projects" seem to be the property of the already rich and/or famous. it's too bad the ones getting overhauled can afford the undertaking. let's see now, vince neill of motley crew gets a car make over for his buddy. hello! if he (neill) were a true friend he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. what a joke! another episode shows a middle aged seemingly well-to-do gal getting her '56 caddy named betsy done. the husband of 30+ years was behind it all. the couple looked like money was not in short supply. what a shame. i guess the lunch pail guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come. i happen to own a '53 ford project chip. will somebody pick me?

the problem with making a movie like this, though, is that the finale, the crème-de-la-creme of the movie, the battle between the two souped-up ships, must be done well. disappointingly, this scene in ironclads is obviously done completely with little model ships in an overgrown tub. there's no tension, little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the timeframe is of the stand-off.the film takes quite a few liberties with the surrounding story, as all true stories do when converted to a movie, such as the union traitor and most notably that of betty stuart (madsen), a virginia belle.it resorts to making a possibly-decent movie involving an interesting story on the ironclads to preaching about the evils of slavery. it was out of place in this historical drama, and was a cheap ploy to bring in the women viewers. it only succeeded in lessening the positives about the film.

...but memorable because it includes an actor i actually recognize! james horan is, by these types of movies' standards, lawrence olivier. he's given some decent performances on stuff like highlander and various star treks, so it's kind of amusing, if mildly depressing, watching him degrade himself here. okay, yeah, there's a plot. horan's character and his wife are fighting, he's having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his "masterpiece" film, and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. but watching horan is really the only enjoyment to be found here.

victor jory never became a major star. he is better known for later character roles than for his early leads. but he was very handsome and an excellent actor.his love scenes with loretta young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. their kisses look very real. and very modern.vivienne osborne is a standout here also. she plays a woman with a reputation. but the character has a good heart.the print i saw was not clear. but what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up! and they are, in some sort of watchable condition, still intact. this is nothing truly special. but if one is willing to sift through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles, one is likely to find some suprtb movies.

i'm so glad i only got this movie for $5. anime is expensive, no doubt about that. i've had my eye on this one for awhile and finally i saw it on sale. i grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment. this movie sucked. i've heard people talk about how gory and violent this movie is. it's really not that gory or violent. i've watched it three times, and i think i've wasted enough of my life on this. the demons get a point for being unique and kinda cool at times. the sex gets a point since it's almost non-stop. the horny old man gets half-a-point for being horny and still having the sex drive. and the main character (who's name i've erased from my mind) gets half-a-point for the cool design of his gun. i saw major connections between this movie and demon city shinjuku. both have same style animation, that's obvious because of the director, both have lame soundtracks which suck like the antichrist, and both have terrible endings. avoid this movie unless you're into anime sex.

corny and horrible, i was not surprised this short lived show didn't make it. i remember fondly when tales from the crypt tried reusing these corny episodes like they were actually scary. coupled with bad acting and lousy music, i was surprised this crummy showed was ever conceived. it never showed up again, and one can only be thankful for this circumstance.

this is a very interesting acquaintance! "two-fisted tales" contains three foolish and childish episodes - genre isn't actually horror or action, more like something in between. where's the suspence? where's the fun? where's the common sense? definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it.first segment is called "showdown". it's a violent, absurd western. i failed to understand the whole idea of it. "king of the road" is a stupid story starring brad pitt. at the time of "two-fisted tales" he was just a pretty face who really didn't know how to act yet. luckily he learned the skill later and now he's a fantastic, talented actor - one of the big ones of the younger generation. story is almost ok in all of it's stupidness. final episode "yellow" is the only segment that's almost entirely successful. it's foolish but funny. we have to thank kirk douglas for that.this movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn. (i should know, that's what i did) if you loved "tales from the crypt", you'll love "two-fisted tales" too because basically it's all the same. i understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare "piece of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. i have the whole package on vhs but i don't think it's a big privilege. you'll have to be a fanatic brad pitt fan to search it out. otherwise don't bother, it's not worth the effort. silly crap.

wakayama tomisaburo's portrayal of fugitive ex-kaishakunin ogami itto felt entirely natural. his demeanor, his voice, his appearance- all of it spoke to dislodgement. when he entered a space i, as well as characters on the screen, could feel he didn't belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble.i read somewhere that mr. wakayama actually took kendo (japanese swordsmanship) training and that would explain his comfort with the katana, which showed magnificently in every cutfest. if you watch the movies, from the moment he draws to the moment he sheaths the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly. he'd even spin the katana quickly to flick off the blood before sheathing it and it would happen in an effortless instant.nakamura kinnosuke's rendition comes across as a rendition. it feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story. as a result, every time i tried to engage i'd lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role, himself. as though it were awkward for him.the swordsmanship in the tv series was entirely old-school hollyweird, too. camera cuts to disguise mr. nakamura's awkwardness with the katana, slow action, targets sitting still, etc. extremely bad, from a viewer's perspective. there was a moment in the episode the castle wall attack when mr. nakamura drew his sword like a child. it was embarrassing. he handled it as though it were heavy! i almost fell off my chair.and let's be frank: the story is about an excellent swordsman. period. swordsmanship is an issue.realism isn't, however: the swordplay in the movies was excellent and manga-like, as was intended, i'm sure. (the baby cart was outfitted with a cluster of automatic, rapid-fire muskets operated by a 3 year old? yes...manga-style.) it's how the story seamlessly weaves historical cultural accuracy into, basically, superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating. (read yoshikawa eiji's musashi [%historical legend]%!) i couldn't really sit through the tv series episodes. they just felt cheap. see the movies first and you'll know what i'm talking about.

i was quite excited when i saw this film in competition at the montreal film festival. along with elephant and a few others, i thought the issue of american gun violence/culture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for film-goers. the press-release promised (in not so many words) a `red violin' for the gun-violence crowd, something to make us ponder our nra-shoot-em-up mindset in this country.after waiting until after 9:15 to be seated for a 9am screening (what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me), we were finally let into the venue to see the film on dv (where did the advertised 35mm print go?). i think i just answered my first question.the result is an abhorrent mess. we get the "gun", in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker' i have ever seen (and i do know more than a few). the film then lapses into irrelevant "character development" only because the characters are either a. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and/or d. racial caricatures. it takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and once we are there, we wish for the inane conversations between the couples and/or the bikers and pawn brokers.the film finds it's conclusion, but not without leaving any cliché untried. i didn't care for the white-trash characters who came in contact with the gun, and the depiction of the minority characters should have the naacp crying foul immediately. all these people would chase after a gun, because they are at the bottom of the societal trash-heap, and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found. placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soul-searching on the part of the characters.the biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled. the plot outline was great. in the hands of a p.t. anderson or gus van zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. but due either to bad screenplay, direction or both, the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costs.my bigger question is who at the mff thought this was competition material. better bury this on showtime at 3am.art blose

the gun is probably the worst film i've ever saw. the comedians direction is very poor, the dialogs sounds like they were written by a 13 year old teenager, the plot (what plot?) is another "suspense" in which it is very hard to get into. finally, nothing in this movie is any good. a big thumbs down to everyone involved and particularly to the montreal film festival who presented this movie in competition!

ok i have seen hershall gordon lewis movies before but this one really takes the cake,its really gory and gross,not to mention disgusting the way the strippers are done in,i'm talking bad acting that makes plan 9 from outer space look like hamlet,the only saving grace is the late great henny youngman as the strip club owner,yeah take my wife..., please.the stripteasers are real sexy for 1972,i believe they used this same plot again in the roger corman movie;stripped to kill in 1987.i did enjoy the earlier h.g.lewis flick 100 maniacs,which was a mini masterpiece of sorts,but bad acting,no awards here,but be aware this is a splatter movie that paved the way for friday the 13th,and saw.in one disturbing scene a half naked stripper has her butt spanked with a meat tenderizer.ugh!morbid stuff here.h.g. lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.

this movie is not a remake of she's all that ( 1999)?where is the renewal of the american movie? this was probably the worst movie i saw in the last 5 years. this and the last movies of schwarzenegger.

of course, all this nonsense begs the question 'does a genre as self-referential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie?' the woeful 'scary movie' (i and ii) took the formula about as far as it could go - 'not another teen movie' really doesn't have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to add.the plot, essentially based on fairyfloss teenflic 'she's all that', walks a shaky line between parody and homage ('john hughes high school'). everything from 'american beauty' to 'varsity blues' is mined for references. the result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience. the downside of giving us a carbon copy plot of 'she's all that' is that we all know where its going anyway. and if we didn't then the jokes would be meaningless.there's extremely little to recommend here. the token gross-out scene (an erupting toilet) seems badly out of place here amongst all the 'feel-good' references. there are moments of humour - the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way. it stinks, don't watch it.

the fact that this film was distributed free with a certain national newspaper which i do not care for did, to a degree, put me off of watching it, but as i had come across a copy that a local charity shop was giving away for nothing i felt i could watch it with a clear conscience.the film does have its moments, the evocation of the thameside location is nicely done, but it does suffer, i feel, from a few too many faults. firstly, vinnie jones is simply not convincing as the journalist. whilst vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the range of acting ability to pull off a role like this.secondly, who would carry around with them a lost manuscript that they have been informed is "priceless"? it seemed that everywhere mr jones went this manuscript went with him! thirdly, the whole dickens aspect of the story, whilst appearing to be important, gets in the way of what could have been an interesting film of corruption in high places. maybe i'm just a bit thick, but i really could not see the point of the story-within-a-story dickens style. this added nothing to the film, and only served to confuse matters when things started to become interesting within the modern day story line.the one bit of praise i will give the film makers is that at least they did attempt something a little different. i am all for british independent films that try to be 'out of left field', but this is not a 'red road' or 'this is england'. what it is is a bit of a mess, and an over-long one at that. yes, it entertains in part, but in the end it felt like two films merged together to make a whole, and failing both by doing so. (also, i can not help think that i have seen something similar done recently on tv by ian banks, set in edinburgh with a story concerning sir arthur conan doyle, the creator of sherlock holmes).

i didn't know anything about this dvd when i hired it. had a quick look here at the comments but decided to keep an open mind. obviously an independent film and low budget but that didn't worry me. i will watch anything with derick jacobi and as always he played his part well. what a pity no one else did. i had watched 'atonement' a few weeks ago with vanessa redgrave and she was sublime. in this she seemed to just turn up to read the lines. in my opinion the main mistake was in casting vinnie jones. to be honest i saw his picture on the dvd cover but didn't notice that he got top billing. a sticker was strategically placed over his name! it was watchable and i quite liked the dickens story alongside present day. maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this might have worked better. still it was weak.

whoever saddled this piece of drek with a title like riddle deserves some kind of award; there are dozens of riddles here like who conceived such a dire project, who funded it, who cast it, who persuaded vanessa redgrave to share even one scene with vinnie jones and so on. the most sane voice connected to the whole schmeer belongs to the person who decided - very, very wisely - that this was unreleasable and not even good enough to go straight to video/dvd which throws up yet one more riddle, why - if we rule out serious payola - did the mail on sunday get involved and deign to give it away. this has golden turkey written all over it and smacks of being shot in two days in somebody's garage and cobbled on to some library footage of london except somehow you know that someone actually did shoot this on location when it would have been kinder to shoot him/herself. vinnie jones and julie cox are not even cardboard cutouts more like tissue paper and i swear pete doherty and kate moss couldn't have done worse whilst derek jacobi is a grotesque joke and the plot moves with the speed of the irish team sliding up the cresta run. apart from that ...

come on now. how did all of these talented actors/actresses end up in this mess? was it some sort of blackmail/lost bet situation? vinnie, you are a muscle man. be what you were born to be.the hot tub scene? the scrabble scene? i was expecting to hear the "needle dragging over the record" sound at any point. and what was up with him carrying around the priceless dickens manuscript with him? let's see, i'm drunk at a bar, why not pull out the priceless dickens manuscript? i'm going to meet some questionable thugs down on the edge of the thames, why not take my priceless dickens manuscript? crapola.terrible. avoid.

as i'm listening to my parents watch this (after i gave up 10 minutes into the film), they have absolutely no idea what is going on. when "charles dickens" stared into the camera, i half expected him to turn into a demon (yes, he looked like one). unfortunately, that didn't happen.this movie had various reasons i did not finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. i mean, seriously, it was sloww. you can only understand 10% of what is said, and the characters were poorly introduced.if you have an english accent and you like a lottt of talking, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laughs, and the same music/sound effects played over and over and over, then this is the movie for you...1/10 - completely horrible.avoid at all costs.

its no wonder this was free with the mail on sunday, slow going, poor acting, and filming (camera flare, near start of movie, is not even artistic) = straight to video, but not in this case, why not recoup some of your (film production costs) by releasing it free with a uk sunday newspaper, at least this way you get a captive audience, and recover some costs.i have not given this film a 1 out of 10, due to the effort to pull some old actors out their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (vanessa redgrave,this an't no blow up), but vinnie jones as a lead, and i think he was better in gone in 60 seconds when he did not speak.this film is dropping in ratings every day,i think this will find its true mark at the 3-4 out of 10,in the very near future

the only riddle in this film was how it ever got made. the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers money (a'la bbc) to keep luvvies in their life style they have been accustomed to, with doing nothing for it.the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes, it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt, gangsters, luvvies or gawd blimey jellied eel types, the story script was just pathetically weak, to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the "sweeney " theme i just expected it. the whole film was a happy shopper sweeney / minder rip off.the priceless manuscript i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street wiseness wouldn't carry around in my breast pocket every where, to the beach and fights etc saying that vinnie jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film, poor bloke.when derek jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was dickens, oh my god, what a load of crap, and i am being positive here

i'm a fan of good, plausible, action movies. and i'm a huge fan of the elite military units such as the navy seals. finally, i'm a huge fan of michael biehn. sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time. i gave it another chance more recently when i bought the dvd. here's the problems with this movie in a quick list: 1. it's a poor mans top gun, for example including a virtual music video of the seal team playing golf with a soundtrack of "the boys are back in town", which concludes with charlie sheen doing an inane chase to get his towed car back.2. this is quite simply a charlie sheen movie, when sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like hot shots. reports i've heard indicate that sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction the rest of the actors in the movie got.3. biehn is the head of the seal team yet sheen seldom obeys him. any seal showing the lack of discipline that sheen's character does, or who endangered the team as he does, wouldn't even have made it through buds training let alone gotten on a team.4. seals are cross trained on weapons. yet in one part of the movie a seal has to "figure out" how to use a u.s. stinger missile.there are a few good scenes in the movie. the assault entry at the beginning, bill paxton as "god", and some of the footage in what was supposed to be beirut at the time. overall though this movie is a loser.

navy seals is an ignorant, racist and complacent movie which thoughtlessly uses the middle east conflict as the backdrop for an action flick concocted for a comfortably sheltered american mid-west audience. the conflict, as well as those involved, is used simply as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young americans who proudly kill arabs for the good of 'freedom'. but what is worse is that the film's action scenes are sloppily handled and unexciting, which prevents navy seals from working even as a mindless shoot-'em-up.charlie sheen's character (hawkins) is disgusting, obnoxious, ignorant, reckless and, above all, racist. he refers to the middle east as a 's**t-hole' and to its inhabitants as 'rag-heads'. throughout the film, the navy seals' characters are glorified through the use of the lebanese natives as cannon fodder. they indiscriminately massacre these people with a consequence-free attitude. there is even the tasteless murder of a young lebanese boy who is shot by hawkins; hawkins makes fun of his language before shooting him whilst making another humorous quip. besides being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. the film's extreme (though predictable)pro-american stance is also revolting. this can be seen when the lebanese-american female journalist informs hawkins that terrorists cant be made to talk because 'they are religious zealots.' hawkins then retorts with 'yeah, and we are the navy seals!' the implication is obviously that zealots are meaningless next to american military might. moreover, even after insulting this journalist's racial heritage and treating her like a sex object, the script demands her inability to resist this disgusting thug and she still ends up sleeping with him - because he is an all-american navy seal. this marginalizes the journalist's character by making her submissive to the 'superior' pro-american attitude of hawkins despite his insulting behaviour toward her. beyond ethics, this plot twist also has little credence as drama. the screenplay is also amateurish. most scenes are simply strung together without any thought for mood, plot or character development. the 'music video' scene at the golf course, for example is just shoddily edited eye candy. and the two scenes where charlie sheen plays the reckless hero are also pointless. in one he jumps off a bridge from moving car just to show his mates how tough he is, and in the other he chases down a tow truck on a push bike and drives his car-off it. neither scene has a follow-up anti-climax, both are highly improbable, and neither has any bearing on the plot as a whole. they are just candy designed as a vehicle to showcase hawkins' cheap all-american heroics, and are poor substitutes for character development. most of the other plot development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly scripted as - in fact this affliction affects the entire movie. apart from the african american navy seal and his wife as well as the characters of michael biehn and charlie sheen, every other member of the team seems unknown to the audience, so that when the climatic scenes roll around there seems to nobody to root for and anybody's death to lament.in such a film, the action sequences can potentially rescue the production. but here they don't. these are badly directed, badly lit, and showcase badly performed stunts. in fact, their direction is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer, resulting in not only the scenes being incomprehensibly hard to follow, but also in a complete lack of fear and suspense. poor lighting only adds to their impotence. the explosions look fake, gunshot wounds unconvincing and one of the more daring stunts, involving crashing a mercedes over a tank, looks just like a stunt which has been staged on a backlot and then poorly edited.the ending of navy seals places the coins firmly on the eyes of this production. first there is the obligatory slow-motion 'running-away-from-the-big-explosion-that-should-have-killed-me' scene with sheen carrying biehn on his back. this was obviously the default scene intended to be the star of the movie's trailers. then there is the ending itself when the remaineder of the seal team, wounded and floating in the ocean, are rescued by a submarine. this submarine had in fact turned for home long before, but of course it had miraculously returned in the nick of time. topping it all of, despite the seals' violent and stressful ordeal, and despite the fact that numerous of their colleagues had just been killed, with a number of them still bleeding acutely, they all manage to laugh heartily while blessing america vociferously. predictable? you can just imagine this ending while watching the opening credits.this movie indulgently uses the middle eastern conflict as a vehicle for the macho all-american tendencies of the movies' photogenic young leads. arabs are treated condescendingly and dismissively, and their slaughter in the movie is used as a fulcrum to glorify the use of american military might against an 'inferior' minority group in a consequence-free environment. the events of 2001 have pointed out that such smug and overconfident trivialising of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence free passtime. the middle east can no longer be written off as a s**t-hole full of rag heads knocking each other off (to quote charlie sheen here); it is now a place in which involvement can lead to severe consequences. today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest themselves quite close to home. therefore, in the very least navy seals looks pretty foolish these days; but this is to be kind. this is a highly ignorant movie, whose production values and professionalism are equally suspect. navy seals is, ideologically and artistically, a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience.

note to self. never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it. great comedian, horrible seal. this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most elite form of military in the world. charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation. thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen. this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie, but why charlie sheen? there are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but sheen decides to wreck them with "funny" comments.

tom selleck plays an absentee son to senile "pop" don ameche and weary mom anne jackson, making up for his indiscretions (one presumes) and taking them in after ameche has burned down his mobile home; meanwhile, selleck's job is vanquished by the f.b.i., his assets are frozen, his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay. brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as ameche's doddering old coot. perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes such as ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version (with selleck getting poked, bumped, prodded, and eventually losing a toe and a testicle!). either way, it's a painful experience, and selleck's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense; he hobbles around and howls in pain, but retains his heart of mush. this movie is mush. * from ****

in fact, everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped, dragged, and hung! if this is what great eugene o'niell drama is like i never want to be victim to viewing it ever again. there are so many things wrong w/ this feature where does one begin? first, elmer bernstein's bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the character's motivations. second, these characters are not pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that i personally disliked every scene in which ives ate up the scenery, but that was the way his characters was written: to be disliked. w/ loren it just never is made clear whether she's good or bad  and all her babbling about how she's going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives  well, i saw what was coming clearly. perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a warm-up for norman bates (which he played two years later) even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end. hokey! third, this film is a studio sound-stage production and it suffers because of it. the story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of "place" regarding the farm (which all the main leads are fighting over). as it is filmed there's no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio sound-stage feel to it that isn't convincing. this is a really awful film.

anthony perkins and sophia loren are absolutely gorgeous in this ca. 1840 "western". that alone, however doesn't help a ridiculous story, with countless historically incorrect elements.byrl ives is convincing as the 70-something tyrannical patriarch, an egomaniac who swears to see his 100th birthday. his wild dancing at a party he gives for his neighbors will make anyone take notice (this guy is sevety six?). always mumbling bible verses, he demands respect, while driving sons and friends away with his self-righteous rantings and emotional cruelties.the love affair between perkins and loren at first appears absurd, but becomes believable near the end. there is plenty of drama, but not enough to feel good about. clearly written for the stage, this story was dated even when it was filmed. perkins whistles "my bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song wasn't composed until 1882.critics knocking sophia lorens "command of the english language" are rather petty. i found her english flawless and completely audible. as a neapolitan, loren speaks a distinct dialect that often had to be dubbed into "proper italian". her "accent", however, hardly affects how she speaks english. as a first generation german american, i can appreciate the efforts of those who learn english as a second, or even third or fourth language."desire under the elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy) in the classic sense. for my enjoyment is was missing a logical story and an overall "pay off" for the time invested. fans of the stars won't want to miss it, others, however, tune in at your own risk!

just finished watching this movie. i couldn't imagine watching this on vhs, as there were scenes where i needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect, even though the scene itself was in english.visually, the movie is pretty appealing. the few cg effects were very obvious insertions, but the prosthetics/creature effects weren't bad. not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up for a lot. acting was generally bad, though how much of that can be blamed on the director i couldn't say, having never seen any of the actors before. the exception, i think, was m. gomez (uxia). she stole every scene she had a part in, and not just because of a very pretty face, but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had. the writing could have been a lot better - the plot was still unmistakably lovecraft, and plenty of lovecraft details were written in, but i personally could have done without most of the dialogue.

i totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a great show. i'll admit that i'd seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all reenacted. but when i caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me big time and i lost interest immediately. then i noticed the disclaimer at the start before an episode that followed. has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me, did they actually make the "acting" and reenacting parts more artificial on purpose, or did i just not notice before. i'm usually pretty good at sensing this stuff, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial i practically tripped over it. now i have no interest whatsoever in watching and have given up entirely on it. it just doesn't have any real value if it's all scripted and acted. and at least lately, it seems very poorly scripted and acted. the comment above that says who cares if it's all reenactments, i do. without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened, one time this guy" heresay. it's info better read in a book.

i cannot believe i actually set up a 'season pass' on my tivo for this, apparently they had a good preview or something .. i can't imagine it though. after seeing about 5 minutes i thought to myself.. why am i watching this.. it is definitely not reality, and some of the worst acting i have ever seen on television.. i am a total addict of reality tv and there is nothing real about this. the acting.. (if you can call it that) is awful.. the only ones that are almost 5% decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show.. although they would need to be a lot prettier to save this train wreck.. if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either. this is obviously a very low budget production with 'actors' who are apparently very cheap. there is no way they could get a job in anything else. someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service.. maybe they could do that. oh and by the way, parco p.i. no longer occupies any space on my tivo or tivo's season pass list. definitely the worst show i've ever seen.

awful, awful, awful show. "real world" issues dealt with blatant unoriginality. stereotypes galore. what the hell is going on with the african-american (black!) guys eyebrows? tyrone power! awful, awful, awful, awful, awful show. the fact that it lasted three seasons beggars belief. this show truly is swill for the brain dead accepters of mediocrity. saved by the bell almost seemed humorous compared to this. well, upon hindsight, no. it's of the same banal ilk and therefore equally devoid of intelligence. the only thing that it's missing so far is the jesus is god message. the mentality and deliverance is the same, yet somehow feels evil and soulless. you can almost hear the tv executives sprouting buzz words at each other. in fact i felt so incensed at this shows excremental existence, i felt compelled to comment. awful, awful, awful show.

my only question is: why did they make this movie? did they have a script or did they make it up as they went along? boom boom doesn't look like a charley davis. john garfield probably turned over in his grave if he saw this.

after the suicide of his father, charlie 'kid' davis (ray `boom boom' mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend tiny (michael chiklis) and travels to las vegas with him trying to become a boxer. on the road, they meet gina (jennifer beals) hitchhiking, they give a lift to her and she becomes charlie's girlfriend. johnny ticotin (rod steiger) is convinced by tiny to be charlie's couch, and the powerful agent alex dumas (joe mantegna), after watching him fighting, becomes his manager, promoting charlie's career. this movie is so boring that it indeed does not deserve to spend much time writing about it. i do not like boxing, but sometimes i watch some worthwhile movie about this theme. but this one is horrible! predictable, full of clichés, having an awful lead actor, a pure waste of time. my vote is three.title (brazil): `corpo e alma' (`body and soul')

the original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. john garfield, ann revere, lilli plmer, william conrad, canada lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..james wong howe. this remake is abominable. in spite of the presence of rod steiger, joe mantegna and jennifer beals there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original. only the main character's name, charlie davis, is the same in both films. i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. i am amazed that rod steiger participated. this may be the only bad film he ever made. maybe he needed the paycheck.

according to "lucien rebatet" in his "histoire de la musique" (robert lafont, bouquins 1973 page 338) beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. he had quite a number of "platonic passions" with female members of the "vienese aristocracy" to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". but musicians , even composers did not qualify for husbands of "fine ladies". haydn was a "servant" of prinz von esterhazy, mozart died from drink or poison and bethoven was according to rebatet a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in vienna. a british biographer, newman says that beethoven contracted syphilis, before he was 40. that he became deaf because of that, is possible, but not certain.the ninth symphony was premiered on may 7, 1824 in the kärntnertortheater in vienna, along with the consecration of the house overture and the first three parts of the missa solemnis. this was the composer's first on-stage appearance in twelve years; the hall was packed. although the performance was directed by michael umlauf the theater's kapellmeister, beethoven shared the stage with him quiet.so what remains of this "female fantasy". ed harris interpretation and characterization are quite good, but too linear, based on the painting by ferninand waldmüller date 1823. i have it in front of me. it shows a man that despises (perhaps hates) the world. with good reason.

am i the only person who saw and remembers amadeus. every scene in "copying" has its counterpart in the milos forman, amadeus - from the galloping carriages accompanied by frenzied strings, to the entrance of anna through the dark hallway preceded by the man with the key, to the very dialog of the conclusion with anna at beethoven's feet a la salieri before the dying mozart. does no one else recall the dialog in that script: salieri "time?" , mozart "common time". ....."we begin with the strings..." and so it "copies".remember cynthia nixon leaning against a door jamb, tears falling down her freckled face - same scene, just replace her with beethoven's nephew. even the scatological humor (fart jokes) are the same. we even have a cardinal followed around by a plate of sweet cookies which recalls salieri in the banquet hall. does no one else remember? !!!!and the scene where anna cries to god "why did you give me this gift?"... salieri said the same thing!and beyond all that we have a juvenile script with an opening exposition that reads like the character identifications you'd find in a children's story. "i am mr. beethoven. i am the composer...."and what, after all, is the purpose of the bridge builder? other than to juxtapose the technical against the artistic... a comparison that is not at all developed - probably because it has no meaning, especially when it comes to beethove who was a master of the technical.there's only one great scene - the playing of the ninth. first, the music, which of itself takes you to tears. but then, there is the highly erotic interaction of anna the copyist keeping time and beethoven conducting which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy. so intense, it's almost embarrassing.but, please - the rest of the film - where is the world's collective memory? you have seen this all before .... and better!

from kreestos: the dialog is terrible, awful, drivel. acting poor. many plot flaws. i don't recommend this at all.from wikipedia:artistic licenses the working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both of whom were male, not female as depicted in the film.the copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score. in fact, they were berated by beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score.the movie is set in 1824 during the composition of beethoven's ninth symphony. throughout the movie beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. in reality, beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. the ninth symphony was composed at a time when beethoven's hearing had deteriorated severely. at this point in his life, most of beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. it can be argued, however, that he was also able to read people's lips, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him.in the film, beethoven makes an allusion to the moonlight sonata. this is an anachronism as the sonata no. 14 "quasi una fantasia" was not named "moonlight" until several years after his death.

i can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. it's like they didn't even bothered trying ro write good comedy, just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks. the worst of all this is that it's all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every way.to make things worse leading man kevin james has a permanent "i'm so funny" smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department, which he doesn't, he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby. which takes me to the relationship between the heffernan's- easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any tv show, really headache inducingly obnoxious remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband. jerry stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100% repetition of his role as frank costanza in seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them. the episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness, their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse.this is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, this is a laughless creative desert.

this is a lame comedy.here's why: a man and wife sitcom. okay.the husband is a douche bag. the wife is the einstein.how original is that? jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld.the gags are lame. no witty one-liners.i have had enough. stop this now.the last word: stupid. the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc. the worst part? kevin james is actually a funny comedian. he just isn't here. leah remini is great eye candy, but is unlikeable. wasted talent is the word. bad sitcom.

a show about an incredibly dumb, man-child and his shrewish hot wife. 99% of the plots revolves around doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tell his wife, she emasculates him and then it's up to the father-in-law (arthur: the typecast character from seinfeld) to aggravate the situation.and the writers dare to say it was influenced by the "honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that's not true.anyway, let's just put it this way. if kevin james had been thin, the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot. if you're 12, or you're fond of fat jokes.. be my guest, watch this show (or any of kevin james movies for that matter).i've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like friends, seinfeld and everybody loves raymond -- i'm still wondering how could anyone do that

this show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s). with this show, it's fat unfunny comedian kevin james as doug hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. he has a pretty wife, carrie (leah remini), who works as legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, arthur spooner (jerry stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's basement. kevin james' doug is your typical beer drinking, sports loving, tv watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. he also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple. beyond the few laughs supplied by jerry stiller's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny. kevin james' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually resolved by his wife. this show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on abc for some reason.

i am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give creative license to tv writers trying to explicate a true story. this story, about karen carpenter, could have helped so many, yet due to the directing and editing, does not.the story, in this case, is not fully addressed, unless one reads psychological journals. while cynthia gibb portrays a realistic karen, it is sad that so much has been edited...louise fletcher portrays her mother, and does an excellent job, with limited material and dialogue. in this case, i give the actors credit for surviving this project.why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....american audiences are quite savvy, and if they have cable, usually educated.i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story, would not have edited out the truth, and allowed the actors to project the reality.richard carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and insulted american audiences. karen's story is important, and it is sad we will never hear it.

i have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials, and saw the karen carpenter story. this movie really didn't show the real karen carpenter. in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). the real karen carpenter was much different. she was outgoing and friendly. she had lots of friends, especially olive newton-john. the movie doesn't even show karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil ramone and his wife itchy "karen". itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york. when karen was in new york, she did see a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. also, karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid, so she could loss weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. also, the karen's husband in the movie is named bob knight, but in real life was named tom burris. also, karen wasn't divorced from tom, but only separated. karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. also, agnes found karen naked in the closet unciousness, unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. the music was very good. that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it.

i've become a big fan of the carpenters, and i didn't really enjoy this movie.i feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through. i wasn't overly fond of cynthia gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided karen's anorexia was suicide, which it clearly wasn't. although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, i thought the movie portrayed agnes (their mother) as being terrible.i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way, such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; i thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective. when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as well.overall, i feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly, quirky side--her genuine personality. even as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know), and almost made it seem baseless. the film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than karen carpenter's story, in my opinion.i would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there), but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. on this note, i can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids, which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.on the whole, it ends up as a low-budget made-for-tv movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond karen's disease. i feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice.

hey ....i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much,perhaps i missed the point.the way i see it , a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with 'schizophrenia' and have informed ,excited ,shocked,evoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think.........while it is true that aparna sen's endeavor was an ambitious one ,in light of all the other movies , this one falls short..... miserably......it was too slow, there were no details about anything and the ending .... was completely ...pointless......it was not open ended or anything ....just pointless.....so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted.......

this is a film that really makes me cringe. in 1951, mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (such as the "crusader rabbit" series on tv)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. unfortunately, columbia picture's cynical ploy worked!! instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have), many accepted them and the oscar people (ampas) actually gave this film the award for best animated short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product. unfortunately, in the dollars and sense world of hollywood, this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons. later, it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. and for this tragedy, i blame, in part, gerald mcboing-boing--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. the story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying "boing-boing" incessantly is a pain.

with several name actors (lance henrikson, david warner, joe don baker), why was jeffery combs given the lead? henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead, as would warner, baker or even others in the movie such as charles napier. combs was miscast in this, and did a poor job of it. everything he did seemed fake or contrived.the script is poor. meaning that if lance henrikson (or another) had the lead role, he might have saved the film (removed it from my "waste of time" category), but it still would have been a bad movie. the screen play was completely lacking. the director should have recognized this and helped the movie along.

'felony' is a b-movie. no doubt about it.of course, if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential. this film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with, the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably don't know their names. it's amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project, almost like they decided to do a b-movie actor reunion. the cast even includes a couple of really first-rate actors: david warner, who most people will recognize from 'titanic' (although my favorite of his roles is jack the ripper in 'time after time') and lance henriksen, who many will remember as bishop in 'aliens'. these two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films.however, as impressive as this collection of actors is, their talent is never fully manifested on the screen. the writers of 'felony' spent a lot of money to assemble a dream-team cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor, the common denominator of all b-movies: a silly script.we start with a silly premise. the bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. but honestly, why bother? in the time it takes them to track down the film crew, a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet. the criminals don't seem to realize how futile their effort is, and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem. silly...but i suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie.then there is the dialogue. it is at times silly, at times cliché, and at times unbelievable...everything you have come to expect from a b-movie. of course, i have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material. this cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved b-movie status quite deservedly, one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts. however, it's disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot. there's not much inspiration evident in these performances, but then again it's an uninspiring script. now, i'll admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines, but honestly, even the very fine actors i mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the story.speaking of the story...even if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy, it still would not redeem 'felony' from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of swiss cheese. you can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how everything adds up. in an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing, the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle, but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing. i admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing, but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish. there was so much that was never explained that i felt extremely frustrated at the end. if you decide to watch it, be prepared to be confused.i haven't even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie, but i won't bother. the funny thing is that despite everything i've said, i have to admit that i can't give 'felony' 1/10 stars. although i can't exactly put my finger on why, i actually found this film to be somewhat likable. the silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it. plus, i really like some of these character actors, and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents, i still got a kick out of seeing them.now, i realize i have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer. it's entirely possible i have completely missed the point. it could be that the filmmakers' intention all along was to make a b-movie. maybe the silliness is all completely intentional. if that's the case, and if i were to rate it on those terms, i would have to say that 'felony' is a classic in the genre of tongue-in-cheek action flicks. b-movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film, will get some chuckles from the script, and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns, explosions, and chases.

lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a b-movie, even in this case starring along side charles napier, master control program, and joe don baker. as always he does a great job of being the bad guy, but the plot is just bad (don't even get me started about the ending). and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty. is it just me, or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute? also, anytime glass is broken in this movie, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. lastly, after watching this, i figure david warner is dying for tron 2.0 to finally get the green light.unfortunately for felony, this will be the third movie i give the rating of 1/10, joining iron eagle iv and no mercy.

one of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others, commercializing a 'shock' or 'gore' factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their birch a new diamond necklace. another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events, dialog and images to the director's own liking. lastly, one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom-of-the-barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day. all three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of. this is, hands-down, the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen thousands. a score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid. not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it, they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story, which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand, both the living and the dead.

i couldn't. i was bored, not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism, but the fact i was watching a subtitle foreign film, which doesn't bother me at all, but was still dubbed.the "special effects" were awful. as the back of the plane splits off, you can see the model is hollow as it "breaks away" in the phony snow. most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play, as the "sounds" of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene."but how what will they eat? they have no food" one military person (it's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge) says, which i'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food, since they were concerned if the people were alive, not how they'd eat. it was simply a stupid line written to point out that, yes, they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive.when they finally decide to eat the bodies, one man finds one shirtless body, who despite being in the snow for however long, is not remotely frozen, in fact, his flesh is very flexible and fresh. he cuts the fresh meat off his back, that again, is not frozen or even cold it appears, and this scene goes on for five minutes. that's where i had to stop. the remake "alive" was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that i'm sure the real survivors praised whereas i can't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version. it was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary. avoid.

making a film based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 andean plane crash, is hard for even the best filmmakers. but the mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don't even try! the actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the uruguayan air force plane crash have all been altered, the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner, and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up. shockingly, it made a ton of money on both sides of the border. thankfully, thought, it has mercifully been forgotten. but the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting guyana: cult of the damned!this cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of alive some fifteen years later. that film was a masterpiece. survive!, to put it mildly, is not.

leave ed wood alone. to call "plan 9 from outer space" the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of hollywood guano its rightful title. this pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical "commentary" actually does seem to be formed along the lines of "plan 9," with badly-staged scenes of down-on-their-luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher-budget epics. but whereas "plan 9" occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall, this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship, with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny (the disgusting burlesque of groucho marx stealing manhattan from the indians) to low camp (hedy lamarr attempting to impersonate joan of arc hearing her "voices") to tedious (dennis hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of napoleon) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of peter lorre as the psychotic nero. give the worst director trophy to irwin allen, for turning so much into so little.

i'm an atheist. to me history and truth mean a lot.this film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book. well it's not. the movie is about the novels 1950s version. some actors were great but that doesn't cover the plot.in short man invents a super-bomb so god and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. the devil analogy persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. what is the spirit of man anyway? and why was the first defendant adam? eventually you just get us christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. though other religions are mentioned, only european christianity is explored.first we get the caveman story. the women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress. real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant. hard times, hard life, adapt and survive. all this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes.next we get egypt's first pyramid construction. today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. as if there was only one pyramid build.the part about moses and one true god was as if the spanish inquisition was asking nicely. inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie.helen of troy's evil grim was so vile that i didn't see why so many were even interested in her. in reality they were just soldiers, following commanders orders, who were "discussing" a political issue of power. she was just an excuse.the cleopatra story was were i saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda. here brother was a lot younger. she was not obsessed with poison, was quite educated to restore library content, and was politically competitive to drag beaten down egypt out of dirt.the part with nero and praying christians in a cave were disgusting. yes, rome burned down. yes, there was persecuted christianity. but the way they portray it was as if the coliseum build itself and there was no vespasian to rebuild rome.attila the hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to king arthur. the crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. and there is no mention of the crusades east to russia that ended in an ironic battle. the knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. a lot of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming, hygiene and plagues.then they cover joan of ark, where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. the sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. at here burning i wanted to yell "hura! now die already! cheap special effects, where is the fire?".by the time they mentioned leonardo i already got fed up with the movie. columbus, spanish slaughter of america, yelling queen elisabeth "kick the spanish armada" and so on and so on.the only reason i wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 marks brothers. and all they got was the scene with manhattan and indians. amusing, but no more than a smile.the witch-hunts are mentioned briefly, as well as plagues (after renascence). when they start portraying revolutions, things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. the us revolution was pursued by the french revolution. oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger, you must replace it with something. so they replaced the french monarchy with new french monarchy. so we get napoleon and his ambitions to go to india by land. but they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title "emperor". the conquests in europe, defeat in russia are sacked to waterloo.the us civil war, the english rich inventors (tesla not included). "mister watson, come here, i want you" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. adolph's words "i invade russia. this is my last territorial demand" were hilarious. it was his last territorial demand.to build suspense god puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the "wall" for the final words. all mighty cant pause the universe for a second? there was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. apparently a paradox man, because the bomb was to go of today. his toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. now that is so wrong pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. and making music out of a weapon? deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. so the man of tomorrow is already a monster.the way i see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. and honestly, compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.to summarize all i will just quote "firefly"s episode "jaynestown": "it's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. ain't about you, jayne. it's about what they need".

i can't understand why many seem to hate this.this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties, using set pieces, props, and costumes similar to those seen in other movies. here, however, the story attempts to run through all of human history, with a frame story about the human race being on trial, with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world. the prosecutor is the devil, played with fiendish glee by vincent price. ok, so it's a little hokey calling the defender "the spirit of all men," but i think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman, in his last film. it is also the last movie in which groucho, harpo, and chico marx all appear, but not together. groucho plays peiter minuet buying manhattan from the indians, in a scene played purely for campy humor. chico isn't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and harpo, we are told, is meant to be isaac newton, discovering gravity. most of the other performances are well done, though.other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space, which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness. there is something called "the great clock of outer space," which, when striking midnight, may signal the end of the world.but at its heart, the movie addresses the problems of wmds and the eternal question of whether man is basically good, or basically evil; and poses it in what i think is an interesting way. also, anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie.

when i was 8 years old, and going through my marx brothers phase, my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film, "the big store" late on friday night, and set the vcr to tape it for me. when i woke up on saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the tv guide -- my father and i discovered "the story of mankind" had been recorded instead."the big store" was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with "the story of mankind." i can almost justify tv guide's error, in that the marx brothers -- groucho, chico, and harpo -- appear in both movies. although in "the story of mankind," they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: groucho plays peter minuit, chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus, and harpo plays isaac newton????? harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; chico only has two or three lines; groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. the rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day, and made them recite total garbage. what a disappointment.tv guide, i sent you a nice letter, i'm still waiting for an apology.for the record: "the big store" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates, and a couple of songs by virginia o'brien. i was really looking forward to seeing it.

irwin allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster. the story of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. virginia mayo as the blond cleopatra, dennis hopper chewing the scenery with napoleon, peter lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as nero, marie wilson as marie antoinette as a roadshow marilyn monroe, that's just some of them.the film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the marx brothers though they all have different roles. chico plays a monk who is christopher columbus's confidante, groucho euchres the indians out of manhattan island as peter minuit, and most astonishing of all, harpo marx as sir isaac newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean. holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged. a super h bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population. it's judgement day a coming.but mankind has its advocates and detractors. speaking for the prosecution is old scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of vincent price. but man has his good side as well and who better than ronald colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. colman and price plead their case before the judge played by cedric hardwicke. in those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the english language ever knew. when the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to. then when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony.what was irwin allen driving at, i'm still trying to figure it out. was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? if it was satire, it just doesn't get off the ground.this was ronald colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something i'd like to go out on, i can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better. so when you see the story of mankind, fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge.

pretty, stereotyped, good looking cast, the story loops in a wide and confusing arc, leading you down a number of garden paths (without attendant fairies) before plummeting to an end that feels you leaving - hollow.if you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump, this is going to be a disappointment. inspite of the main character's notionally overt sexuality i felt that he was androgynous, lacking a clear male persona, rather like his lacking of a clear french persona. even though he is notionally laid naked (or rather sat naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations - that little thing called plot. probably a stereotypically english speaking point of view, at least if you take the side of the film.

l'auberge espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of dobie gillis. where is their bob denver? do they even have a dwayne hickman? a french man moves to barcelona to attend classes. he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. this movie is unbelievably bland. the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a belgian lesbian. she places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. but bare armpits does not a good movie make. l'emmerdeur was funny, so was la cage aux folles. l'auberge espagnole and le placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy.

i have seen previous movies from cédric klapisch, and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth. having been an erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad, i know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. yes, it is great fun! because of that i thought i should not miss this movie. unfortunately i was disappointed to find that l'auberge espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are trite and the story is shallow. although there are quite a few familiar situations, they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events. this made the movie uninteresting to watch, and gave me a strong "been-there-done-that-don't-you-have-anything-to-add?" feeling. apart from that, the movie lacks a firm story. it sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real-life' show than a seriously made movie.however, i can imagine that if you haven't studied or travelled abroad, this might be fun to watch.

i was really looking forward to seeing this movie, having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in barcelona myself. the premise is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals. but the director's weak swats at symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark, and it leaves us, the audience, feeling confused & disordered. bravo.perhaps if this movie had been presented as a european "american pie" flick, then i'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. but right off the bat, the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the "inner self" vs. the "public self" (one's "mother tongue" vs. one's "secondary language"). furthermore, it dives boldly into the subject of racial/national stereotyping. off to an interesting start, eh?wrong. that's as far as it goes. these interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic. it reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere, but the speaker ends by saying, "so in conclusion, i hope you see how this relates to my original thought!"furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. if the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking, beer-swilling english brat as a caricature of prejudice? why did the director portray the american as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whilst the europeans tolerate him superciliously? why is the british girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs (calling french people "frogs" and butchering the french language) while everyone else is above all that? the answer is that this isn't a deep or well-thought out film. it's simply an anglophobe's retort to the anglophiles. but really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! now there's a funny irony to consider.ok, philosophy, artistry & socio-political commentary aside, i was still very bored by this movie. there is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends, but aside from that i was hardly entertained at all. the only reason why i watched it through to the end is that i'd like to brush up on my french & spanish. (you see, we monolingual americans may be stupid, but we do try.)

not a terrible movie... but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a action/thriller. the acting is generally pretty decent for a scifi channel movie. barry corbin plays a credible us senator, and lou diamond phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. the special effects are well, "special" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train.goofs: a meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. the car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. after the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.spoilers...a good portion of the movie's events are predictable, from the helicopter crash ("pull up, pull up!"), to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel set-up at the end.the scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. they are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the monty python rabbit? spoiler goof: in one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. later in the movie todd bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. on several occasions, lou diamond phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands.

i did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. it combined the awful special effects and plot of the original "blob," with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of "runaway train." the only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they'd combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch. what an incredible stinker! lou diamond phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. barry corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a u.s. senator from texas and plays it well. he should next do the lead role in the story of trent lott or jesse helms. the women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the fay wray memorial screaming contest. special effects are unbelievably bad. h.s. kids in film class in north dakota could have done a better job. the writers must have pulled a heist at the cliché bank to accumulate this many. i couldn't watch any more without being forced to sit in the clockwork orange chair. i have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. ugh! caveat emptor.

we all know that special effects cost money, but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots. the train is obviously a model in most moving shots, the helicopter is obviously computer generated, the alien looks like the one from the end of spaceballs, except it's a decade later and spaceballs had an excuse.the only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to see.not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either.please, don't waste your time. please.

la ragazza del vagone letto, or terror express! as it was called on the version i saw, starts as various passengers board a long distance train. three thuggish idiots, dave, phil & ernie (carlo de mejo) board & it's clear that they're there to cause trouble as they intimidate & verbally abuse the other passengers & staff. as the train speeds along things turn nasty when a prostitute named juliette (silvia dionisio) refuses to have sex with dave, he & his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with juliette &, well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop & his prisoner who set about saving the day. erm, that's it really...this italian production was directed by ferdinando baldi & is complete total & utter crap from start to finish. the script by george eastman as luigi montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror/thriller. it is tediously slow, it's 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens & as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that italian sleaze & horror was delivering at that time. the film can be compared to another italian production the infinitely better the house on the edge of the park (1980) made the same year, it's a very broad comparison though as everything that made the house on the edge of the park the notorious film that it is is absent from la ragazza del vagone letto, there's no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there's only a couple of really tame rapes, the story has no twists or turns & as it's incredibly boring to watch. italian sleaze & horror from the late 70's & early 80's isn't known for it's strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does scrape the bottom-of-the-barrel on all counts. the character's are awful, the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up & giving some background as to why they're on the train but this is all quickly forgotten & comes to absolutely nothing. i hated the lame ending as well & i don't know if i missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train? i don't think there was, was there? i'm sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason, surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial & interesting if not more plausible. in my opinion this film stinks, it's as simple & straight forward as that i'm afraid.director baldi does an ok job, to be fair he only has one corridor & a few train compartments to work with so i'll cut him some slack, having said that the film does become very repetitive. there is no style & he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music. there is not one single drop of blood spilt in the entire film, that's right not one single drop. forget about any gore or violence as you'll be very disappointed if you do, like i did. there are a couple of rapes but they're amateurishly staged & have zero impact, the nasty exploitation & sleaze of say i spit on your grave (1978) or the last house on the left (1972) is not here.technically la ragazza del vagone letto is ok & it's quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum. the acting is poor as usual, although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost. fans of italian horror will recognise a lot of the voices here.la ragazza del vagone letto is a terrible film, it's just my opinion but i was bored to tears waiting for something to happen & when it eventually never i felt cheated, i want those 80 minutes of my life back. this piece of crap isn't even fit to grace the 99p vhs bargain bin in your local blockbuster, one to avoid.

i've got to say, i'm a big fan of these 'last house on the left' rip-offs, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me; but one of these sorts of films that i didn't like much was aldo lado's 'night train murders', and unfortunately it would seem that trains and the last house on the left don't mix, as terror express is another lacklustre rip-off. something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character; and while terror express offers up three potential candidates, not one of them steps up and becomes this villain, leaving the lacking in the most important area. it actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board. this leads the audience to believe that there is more in store, but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set. from there, the trio end up 'taking over' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.it has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there's hardly any blood. director ferdinando baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. the idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex, as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time, and despite one very tame 'sandwich' sequence, none of the sex is particularly interesting. since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. films like this are often lacking in style, suspense and credibility; but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you. as you might expect, none of the acting is up to anything; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish. the direction is lacking in style, and there's very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care what is going to happen. overall, this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film, and i can't recommend it.

the unpleasant "home invasion" genre can be traced back to wes craven's early sleazefest "last house on the left", with such nasty off-shoots as "i spit on your grave", "wrong way" and "the visitors" soon following in the footsteps of that film. here, in this early '80s italian offering the same plot is regurgitated once more, with the twist being that this one is set on a continental train. "la ragazza del vagone letto"  known in english-speaking countries as "terror express"  starts out surprisingly well but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse, as the sex scenes start to gain precedence over the more serious action and suspense.david, phil and ernie, three rich youths who wallow in terrorising and humiliating others, board a trans-continental express in italy. the train is full of other passengers, among them prostitute juliette (silvia dionisio) who rides the train frequently and has struck up a deal with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp, persuading the male passengers to part with their cash for a night of passion in her sleeping compartment. the three cretins quickly set about upsetting the passengers with their aggressive, drunken behaviour, but matters get more serious when they seize control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves in from the rest of the train. pretty soon, they are revelling in their temporary control. a young wife (zora kerova) is raped by two of the youths in a cramped compartment; juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault; and later the odious trio force the male passengers to role a dice in order to decide which one will rape a 16 year old virgin travelling with her parents (a concept made doubly tasteless by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game). the only passenger who seems prepared to fight back is a convict who is being escorted to germany, but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs? la ragazza del vagone letto gets off to a decent start. various intriguing characters are introduced, and the three hoodlums are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the travellers. though the story is clearly the stuff of exploitation, the opening scenes are built up carefully and the film seems to be rising above the usual gutter-level of its genre. things fall apart during a horrid scene in which kerova is sex-sandwiched in a toilet compartment by two of the thugs. the scene is gloatingly filmed, and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators instead, we are being asked to feel turned on. this is sensationalism at its worst. further humiliating rapes follow, but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over acts of oral sex and the female genitalia. one sequence featuring the 16 year old girl teeters on the brink of hard core and feels particularly "wrong". by the end of la ragazza del vagone letto it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller, for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense. lovers of sleaze will revel in it; others might want to look elsewhere.

another sadistic and ultra-sleazy late 70's/early 80's revenge movie?? wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his "last house on the left" although "terror express" is more like a rip-off of other rip-offs, like "i spit on your grave" and especially "night train murders". storywise, this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleaze-factor by a thousand! this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending. on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok. they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females. things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three. this is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood. this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women, but the sex in "terror express" isn't unsettling at all. on the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves! the music is great, the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld. the villains are wimps and the train-passengers are so motionless they look like part of the set. if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets, this is your film. however, your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled. "terror express" should be in the porn-section of videostores.

yet another cookie-cutter movie about a hardened adult who meets an adorable, street-smart kid (cop and 1/2, gloria, etc). and once again, it is not funny or interesting, for anyone to watch - kids or adults. i'm sure some people might find this movie amusing, but i have no earthly idea why. once again, i feel sorry for the poor kids who were forced to work in this movie, so that everyone else and their parents could make some bucks at the price of a cheesy cheesy movie.

this movie has got to be one of the all-time lows of michael j. fox's generally respectable career. i should have known how awful this movie was when i rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter. never a good sign! fox plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids. his character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being mikey. his big break comes when he meets angie vega, a talented child. vega is abrasive and not at all likeable. in fact, the only likeable character in the whole movie is cyndi lauper as a brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency. one of those movies that makes me want to stick a post-it note to the box warning others not to waste their time!

this movie was so incredibly boring, michael j. fox could've done so much better. sorry, but it's true for all you people who liked the movie

this isn't a bad movie. it's fun to watch for the first time. however it has absolutely no replay value at all. when you try to watch it again it gets so boring you have to turn it off. i give this movie a 6 out of 10.

disappointing comedy-drama with sentimental coating has michael j. fox ideally cast as a former child star who now runs a talent agency for thespian tots; nathan lane and cyndi lauper are his assistants. this all sounds as if it can't miss, however too much of the scenario is given over to strident christina vidal as a streetwise tyke whom fox believes will be the next big thing. they lock quickly lock heads, and the bantering dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting, formula finish. fox and lane are both appealing, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to treacle. slickly produced, but ultimately stale. *1/2 from ****

*this review may contain spoilers... or maybe not. the warning is the same for all*dang it. just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies, they give us this. actually, the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane, deep blue sea, etc... that means, a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people. in this case, an alien in a train. wow.i must say that, when i first saw this thing on cable, i couldn't stop laughing. no scifi film had prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic i couldn't believe it! the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters. but since they're not so famous (to say the least), i wasn't expecting much of them. except diamond phillips. no comments there, but i think the guy was desperate to find a job. the problem was something called 'special effects', horrible even for scifi channel standards. that model/toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model/toy helicopter, bigger than a train's wagon), the meteor coming horizontally from space, the 'baby' alien (a sock puppet, and i ain't kiddin'), the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly... while they were static; when they started "moving", it was awful, the explosions (the terrorist blew up literally! and what about the exploding helicopter! just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?), the insane mathematics used (they couldn't even solve a school problem right!)... and i won't talk about that doomsday-like ending, by that time i didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying. if i remember right, i did both.it's an ideal movie to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. but be warned; it's so ridiculous at so many levels... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief...

it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this. however, this is a dreadful film. gene hackman wastes time (and one suspects, many dollars) on re-playing his most famous, and oft recreated, role as "gene hackman". otherwise, television actors are given the chance to become film stars, and successfully, resist the temptation. patrick swayze has a minor part and went on to greater things, for which he must be eternally thankful.i watched this film, as a result of someone else's review and i felt that another point of view was merited. you may not agree with my review but now, at least, you have been warned.

maybe our standards for vientam movies have increased since born on the fourth of july, full metal jacket, and platoon. this movie has a predictable plot, bad writing, bad acting, bad directing, bad special effects, etc. compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable.

but to be a little more precise i do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be. eventhough the actors (famous to semi-famous) didn't do a very great job. directors fault? could be the script as well hard for me to say? anyway, if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns. sort of fun :) well i guess i could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it. if you are desperate enough or a hackman freak see it otherwise don't!live well and prosper

i know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won't do as a film about vietnam. viet nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out.this film stars gene hackman who is korean war vet assigned to train a group of rag-tag viet nam vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of american pow's held at a camp there. these men include a former tunnel rat, a crazy acid dropping sailor, a blond tanned surfer from california and some inexperienced kid (patrick swayze) who just so happens had a dad that was killed in nam. they train first at some camp in texas and once in nam they are found out and lose all their weapons. they are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men. most of the men are found and saved but the rag-tag group is mostly wiped out.this movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush, and who was going to die and who was going to live. viet nam i'm guessing was not like a video game....

gene hackman is a former marine corps colonel who musters a handful of private vietnam vets to go back to laos and rescue some americans who have been listed as missing in action. hackman suspects that, in actuality, the half-dozen or so mias are secretly being held in a remote camp by laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor. hackman is being paid by the wealthy robert stack, whose son, like hackman's son, is thought to be among the mias. but the circumstances are such that hackman can only manage to buy old and out-dated weapons, though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anti-communist loatian and his two daughters along the way.i don't think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the vietnames still holding our mias for propaganda purposes. the myth was real enough. if anyone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, bring back the mias. i think, instead, that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth. it was absurd on the face of it. why would our former enemy refuse to return mias? propaganda? where is the propaganda value in something that's kept secret? to add the labor supply? they need a hundred extra laborers in vietnam and laos? the motives behind this movie -- with its triumphant music and high body count -- were scurrilous.but how about the movie itself? stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated mias, it's a routine paramilitary actioner, no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. gene hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water. he's just about always reliable.of the others, this being a formulaic plot, derived from "the dirty dozen" among others, i kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission. of the three anti-communist asians, i figured one or more were dead meat. that's why asian helpers appear in movies like this. (i was right two times out of three.) i also figured patrick swayzie as the rookie ex-officer, the youngest of the group, who'd never "earned the respect" of the others because he'd never seen combat, would also have to go in some heroic mode. wrong. he becomes a hero, true, but survives intact. i thought there was a fifty-fifty chance that hackman would have to go too, but he makes it out okay. the formula doesn't really stretch for originality either. charles bronson's claustrophobic pow escapee from "the great escape" is here in fred ward's ex tunnel rat, a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it, so that he can do a recon on the laotian pow camp.the title, "uncommon valor," is from a tribute that admiral nimitz made to the men on iwo jima -- "uncommon valor was common that day." nimitz was certainly right about that. whether or not the men who fought in vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point. anyone who saw combat or even came near it, putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them, were heroic enough. this movie, and the way it exploits our bitterness about the vietnam war, doesn't really do them justice.

this pathetic excuse for a movie doesn't have a decent structure or a sensible closure. the characters were confusing and the entire plot kept getting off track. i'd have to say that pixel perfect was a disgrace. this is what happens when you let disney channel make movies.

i'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in truth, the acting isn't too bad and the story isn't as terrible as some made-for-disney movies have been. the story itself is shallow and undeveloped but that isn't surprising in a film of this type. the acting is more than a bit two-dimensional, but i give the actors credit for managing to do anything with the material that they had to work with.however, it's inexcusable, in my book, to base an entire storyline on the theory that they've created a 'perfect' pop star and then cast an actress who can't sing to save her life. if the girl can't sing, have someone who can record the music!this actress is a terrible singer - she was so flat she was usually singing in a totally different key!

one of the worst movies i've ever seen. completely ridiculous. the story is bad. the animations are completely childish and displaced. the physics of the holograms are hilarious from how much they are completely wrong. omg, i even wanna believe that this film has disney label on it. yuck. the actresses are somewhat beautiful, but there are so many good films with astonishing actresses that are far more valuable to see than this one. final remark, bad film. don't bother to watch it. if you're looking for films to see with your kids consider other alternatives like ratattuile, monster inc or an enchanted story (on theaters). seriously.

bad, a lot a crap. it copied simone, also a bad movie! them flips when "loretta modern" sang was lame. that internet scenes made it worse. and roscoe loves a "hologram"! thats plain stupid! i give 0 stars! because they copied, the plot was stupid, the whole movie was thumbs down all the way!

last night, i got bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out kold' which i had once bought with a whole lot of other cheap movies from a videostore. seemed like a good old action movie, so i took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. well, the pain started right from the beginning. the main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy i have ever seen. as the good person he has to be nice of course, but he is just a pussy! that totally doesn't fit with a boxer that has 28 ko's and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money. even nice guys can still be cool. well, then came his first fight while he was working for this pimp. every punch was clearly missed and that became even more annoying because the sound effect weren't synchronised with the punches. then there is this totally worthless acting of the whole cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. i gave it a 1 because i have never seen such a bad movie.

watching alien express inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, yes, sheer terror. to think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this. the horror, the horror.tell me if any of this sounds familiar.a train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to las vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a senator from texas (barry corbin, the only actor with roles both alien express and no country for old men in the same decade). at a railroad crossing in utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.the train stops. local law enforcement is summoned. oh, can it be? the senator has a lovely young lady (amy locane from cry-baby and melrose place) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. lou diamond phillips (stand and deliver, la bamba) is the ex-husband.meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train.the train leaves. lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. as the buddy's reward, he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.which is another example of how poorly written alien express is. the cop hero's sidekick must die, we all know that. but he's supposed to die near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives.once on the train, lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel bruce willis in die hard by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. yeah, lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. the part he's playing isn't worth bothering with, but he's in good shape.the senator is going to have an afternoon delight with miss utah, but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.soon we have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while lou and todd bridges (diff'rent strokes) try to save as many lives as they can.there is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for thirty-five more years together. the dude gets banged up, but he and the mrs. both live. maybe the writers just lost track of them.this is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. these actors who have done better work (and, really, deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work. did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile, or did they cry (and/or drink) themselves to sleep at night? at the end of the story the (fairly numerous, all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unhooked. the other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.lou and his ex are reunited. happiness reigns. i'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet, but i digress.someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. look, make a wish. then another. then more and more. the earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.it's gotten to a point that seeing the words "the sci-fi channel presents" on an "original" movie tells us that we'll be glad we have ti-vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. or, better yet, just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely.

if you would like to watch an example of how not to make a film, then you need to watch this. i, myself, with no film making experience could do better. the script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure. in order to make up for this flaw, you would think the action would be decent, wouldn't you?as the acting, editing and overall piecing together of the film is appalling the only saving grace is the dreadful performance by the lead actor. the reason why he is the saving grace, is because he is so genuinely bad at acting, that he should win an oscar for it. at least some recognition for making me laugh at him so much.toss in a dead woman's body after an all male shoot out (where did she come from?), pull the semi automatic trigger tens of times while the soundman pulls off two gunshot effects, reflection of the camera crew in kool mo dee's shades, one and only one music track for the whole film, an unoriginal script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a really, really bad film. its actually more fun spotting the errors than actually trying to find something positive. avoid at all costs.

i rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering i like this type of movie and considering who was in it but boy was i wrong. the acting stunk, the fight scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of known people to be in it but didn't cast anyone with acting ability to play the lead? i noticed some people gave it a 10. why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse **** a 10. you can say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give it a 10 for comedy. you have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasn't intending. maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think it's fun to mislead people. you're playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do. if the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but don't lie. i gave this movie a 4 and am glad that i was able to check this out for free from my library cause this movie sucked and really isn't worth paying a cent to see.

purchased this film for one dollar and figured i could never go wrong, my big mistake was watching it. enjoyed the acting of ice-t and the rapping which gave lots of class to this film about los angeles and the world of pimps. there is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career, but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires. he gets hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up. this boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts. this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy.

wow, jeez, i don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie. i seriously don't know what the hell david bradley began smoking after making hard justice, which in my opinion, was quite a good movie after the american ninja features. i hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after cyborg cop. lucky i saw them on amazon for like 5 pounds each and i can safely say the following: if i had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds i spent on total reality, crisis and expect to die, i would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted. my god, how the heck can anybody label these as "movies" ??? and why do action/martial arts actors fall knee-deep into the smelliest horse-dung when they've like reached their peak?? i mean, david bradley's no oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining. tough, cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent. but i seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making hard justice. his final 3 movies have to frankly be the worst i have ever had to sit through. as i mentioned before, i'd love to get my money back on the 3 dvds i bought. crisis was the epitome of sleepiness, total reality was harsh but this expect to die is just utter nonsense. i bet the director was either mega-stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every david bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap. the plot circles around a doctor (bradley) who develops some type of virtual reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one. sorry but i just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair-do, glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely no physical fighting whatsoever (frankly, his best asset). the film is even worse than any of those saturday afternoon b-movies because the acting is laughable, the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie, well, what can i say... the actors look like they're training with their gym buddy. we get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily... a french hairy version of van damme who just can't fight, act or speak to save his freaking life and bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the evil doctor who i was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish. i even reckon he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him. for a b-actor, i must admit i really liked this guy, his style, physique, fighting skills... but i'm really, really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because i honestly wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of pee-taking material like this one. avoid at all costs even if you're family of david bradley, you'll be glad you did, word.

they must be. i'll list them so that you can check them off one-by-one:- police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around, because they don't have evidence facilities.- when you get shot, you always grunt the same way, and fly back the same way, even though there's never a mark on your body.- police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots, and don't think anything is suspicious when an undercover policewoman's phone call during a high-level drug-and-money deal is cut shot by that gun shot.- bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins with one shot, but can't hit a big, bulky martial artist with 100.- if you rocket launcher a car in a car park, the next three cars in a line will blow up evenly in 15 second intervals.- further to the last point, all the cheap cars are always parked next to each other.- the smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars blowing up.- virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce fit on five floppy disks.- virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like windows 3.1 screen-savers.- floppy disks can be read even after they've been shot up.- semi-drunk guys in bars attentively watch the news when they're at the pub, and have a deep understanding of american modern military history, agent orange, and the family trees of high-ranking military officials. however, they're only able to articulate their points using dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven.- even though fights appear to break out almost hourly in a bar, that bar has only one staff worker, who both pours the beers and handles security. of course he knows martial arts.- gold medal olympians regularly make the simple transition to corporate ceos of software companies in a matter of years.- a woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she's never played, raves constantly about her competitor's great games, and can rattle off facts and figures regarding her company's rivals - but she didn't know that they overtook almost all the other companies in the field in large corporate mergers.- bad guys always die in slow motion. always.- wives tell their husbands that they're pregnant by raving about their man's bravery in killing bad guys.- wives do large amounts of their husband's police work; this might explain why she whines and complains so much every time he has to go to work. although, it doesn't explain why she adores him so much every time he gets up in the morning and she can read about his murderous escapades.- it's fairly typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnappings, kill tons of people on three separate occasions and stop a variety of multi-million dollar illegal deals in a week.- when trying to lose a car that's following you, it's wise to continue driving under the speed limit. and if you're following a cop, subtlety is not important - you can tailgate him for miles, then park right next to him. he won't notice.- all cops are experienced martial artists.- it is possible to kick a guy four metres in distance.- people scream or grunt in pain when they are punched or kick, yet when they have their arm broken, they don't make a sound.- bad guys clean their bloodied axes with their handkerchiefs, and then leave them in their pocket for many days.- pieces of wood, when swung with one sharp blow, shatter sturdy ladders in six or more places simultaneously.- the photo, and listed special features on the back of the dvd case don't necessarily have to be on the dvd. the advertised interactive menus? why not no menu at all! the advertised scene index? why not have the whole thing as one scene/chapter, and not need an index! likewise, it's ok to use the matrix's font and title in the tag-line, and not be a rip-off in any way.with all of this, i'm in shock that 12 out of the 15 top credited actors never acted again.

in the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to vr has been reissued with the tag-line "the matrix just got deadler!", in a box with a very matrix inspired cover (still called "expect to die" though). due to the choice of font however the tag-line looks to all the world like it says "beablier". anyway.to complete the transformation to matrix wannabe they have mocked up a vr fight scene with a morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. it may be important to know that this character does not feature in the film.overall this film is a travesty on every level. jalal mehri is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts. however his partner stone is played by evan lurie, who in this film is simply the worst actor i have ever seen. clearly he was chosen to make jalal look good in comparison. worst film i have seen for a long long time.

my first question, is not about the horrible acting, not about the horrendous writing, it is the directing. the choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions i have ever seen. why does every single bad guy have to die in slow motion? i was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. the camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on. i was just about to turn the movie off because of jalal merhi's accent, when it made it to the sex scene, so i thought it might get better, well it did not. if you rate special effects on an a,b,c rating scale, i would have to put it around a w or so, and did i mention the acting? wow, was it bad!!! and the worst part of the entire "expect to die" experience, is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "the matrix just got deadlier". comparing this movie to the matrix is easily the worst comparison i have ever seen. if you haven't seen this movie, don't, unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall.

as a fan of bad movies (and mst3k, and a member of mft3k), i must say i've seen my share of them. but geez! even the worst i've seen at least had a soundtrack. as george lazenby stiffly wanders around hong kong, doing who knows what, you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema. or any of that music that fills elevators. i don't think anyone in this film even hums.now, this isn't entirely true -- there *is* a sound track. if you listen closely, you will hear it chime in about a half-dozen times through the course of the film. of course, the timing will be entirely inappropriate, and it doesn't last very long, but something that could be classified as "music" does occur. your best bet, though, is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the tv with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. the rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers.keep an eye out for sammo hung as a minor villian in this film. aren't we all glad he found jackie chan to work with?

*spoilers - sorry!* the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is 'gremlins'. it's the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies, but i enjoyed it. it wasn't too complicated as i hadn't seen the past two, but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same. critters starts with a man, his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation (although it turns out that they end up at their own home - which i have no idea what the hell went on) the girl meets up with a boy (played by leo dicaprio) and they go hang out in a nearby forest. they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters. he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation, i would not speak to him. the critters steal a ride of the girl and boy's car and end up in their flat thing. they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk. they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girl's dad. they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic. the critters eat stuff in the kitchen (spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene???!) and i can't remember (not a good thing) but i'm sure they have to go back for something/someone. anyway they end up getting out and saved. the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he can't because they are endangered and so he sends them home.the ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off. it's a thrilling, exciting movie worth a watch. but, if you're looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies. sorry!

sadly, this movie is not very good. but does it really matter ? we all know the basics for the story, and this has nothing new. but i love low budget horror & sci fic camp classics ... so i forgive this one. about thew only thing that anyone remember from this movie, is that little leonardo dicaprio made his debut in it.he did ok. the part didn't ask for great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway ... little leonardo dicaprio was very cute ... and so was the girl. the movie is fun, if you like horror & sci fic camp classics and are experienced in watching them.

it is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed. the dialogue was so bad it was sickening. the train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students. lou diamond phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this "movie"? was shown at a private screening afterwhich he most likely left by the back door. the only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to get through this one. i couldn't stand to watch all of it, it was so predictable that it was funny. who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy.

critters 3 starts on the open road as clifford (john calvin) his teenage daughter annie (aimee brooks) & his young son johnny (the imdb list two actor's christian & josephh cousins, identical twins perhaps?) are heading back home from a vacation. suddenly the tyre on their van blows & they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it. while there annie & johnny meet a kid named josh (leonardo dicaprio, yes that one) who in turn all run into charlie mcfadden (the films co-producer don keith opper) from the previous two critter films. charlie tells them the story of the critters & the town of grovers bend but they don't believe him. meanwhile back at the van a critter lays some eggs on it's underside, out of sight from everyone. once clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home, a run down urban tenement block in los angeles somewhere complete with critter eggs along for the ride. upon arrival the eggs hatch & the critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of frank (geoffrey blake), the caretaker. as the night draws on the few remaining residents, a fat woman named rosalie (diana bellamy), a telephone repair woman marsha (katherine cortez), an elderly couple mr. (bill zuckert) & mrs. menges (frances bay) must come together with clifford & his kids to fight the critters. josh also makes an appearance as his stepfather (william dennis hunt) owns the building. but will the group be able to defeat the critters & prevent themselves from becoming dinner?directed kristine peterson i thought critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film, but at least she can say she made a film staring leonardo dicaprio & not many people can say that! the budget for critters 3 probably wasn't exactly a fortune as the whole production looks cheap throughout, there are very few characters, very few critters & i think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at once & it does away with any sort of space angle so there are no expensive spaceship or distant alien planet special effects to pay for. the script by david j. schow is strictly by-the-numbers & very predictable. a group of humans are stuck in an isolated situation with critters & have no means of contacting the outside world for help, that plot scenario sounds very familiar right? well it's same as the previous critters (1986) & critters 2: the main course (1988) & many other horror films so it should. critters 3 does nothing with the premise, it never even tries to add anything to an already old, tired & well used storyline. critters 3 is also very tame for a horror film with only two people actually being killed, the comedy elements are seriously lacking as well with the best joke critters 3 can mange being a critter eating some beans & then farting, very funny if your about 5 years old. the characters are mostly standard horror film clichés & quickly became annoying. there is virtually no blood or gore in critters 3 at all, just a few splashes of blood & disappointingly critters 3 in fact seems to go out of it's way not to show any violence. the special effects on the critters are ok but they still look like static, simplistic hand-puppets that have very little movement. the acting isn't that good & critters 3 happens to be a certain leonardo dicaprio's very first feature film, to be fair to the kid he's alright & i wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea what he go on to become. why on earth does that charlie guy have to keep popping up in these critter films? to give critters 3 some credit it moves along at a good pace & isn't boring, it's generally well made with nice enough production values & it's a bit of harmless fun if your in the right sort of mood & thankfully it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes. overall critters 3 is an ok time waster but don't expect anything deep or meaningful. there's nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror film but i couldn't help feeling that i'd seen it all before. an average time-waster that isn't as good as either of the previous two critter films. critters 3 ends with a 'to be continued...' as this was filmed back to back with critters 4 (1991) which unsurprisingly went straight to video, probably to save even more money. critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on t.v. for free otherwise don't bother.

basically the first two critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way. this movie is way more of a b-movie, that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons.this is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies. basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well, as good as none, since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late) and the budget for this one obviously went down again. to save even more costs, the movie got shot back-to-back with part 4, which i imaging will be just as bad, since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one.it's just a typical b-genre movie, that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment. it makes "critters 3" a real redundant sequel, you can easily do without. granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either. the movie just falls flat as a science-fiction/horror/comedy.also kind of strange to notice how the critters has suddenly changed in this one. they are about double their usual size this time, without giving an explanation for that and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one.the movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of leonardo dicaprio. he was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby-faced like he still does now. i like watching this well known actors in their early roles. it's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. of course dicaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days.really a too silly and lame movie.4/10

this is fairly typical for the sci-fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot, and terrible special effects. we've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train, and lou diamond phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a performance. and save the day. everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking lou, then of course comes to love him again at the end. the obnoxious state senator who gets munched early on, and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. then there's an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever, except to provide us with 3% more running around. he spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.the special effects really deserve their own paragraph. we start with a meteorite that flies through the air, trailing flames behind it, at about 100 miles per hour. according to the physics of this movie, if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. then it lands on the hood of a car, coming in horizontally. sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor i guess. it really doesn't damage the car much, just bends up the hood a little bit. later on lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. even though the train only had a two minute head start, it takes a good half hour to catch it. the cgi is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over. then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. it looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter. about 10 times too big. no wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time, it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do, he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off, but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling, so why this would keep them on the train i have no idea.overall, if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing, and it's down to this movie or reruns on the food network, well, come to think of it, some of those chefs are kind of cute. usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl, some t&a, or a character that actually has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. i really didn't see any of that here.

what do you get when you put lou diamond philips, todd bridges, barry corbin with a bad toupee, and an alien all on a train? you get a very bad movie called "alien express" or "dead rail" that would be more entertaining on comedy central's old series "mystery science theater 3000." you name it, this awful movie suffered in areas of acting, plot, storyline, and special effects. in fact, the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common ho scale model in front of a painted background! the rest of the special effects goes downhill from there.the plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970's movies called "horror express" and a disaster movie called "the cassandra crossing." at least "the cassandra crossing" had a better cast, an engaging storyline, and real train scenes.if you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a "b movie" party then watch this; otherwise, "alien express" derailed long before departing from the station!

i am a big fan of sci-fi movies. so, when i saw this movie in the epg, i thought i was in for a pleasant evening. what a disappointment ! such a poor display of "special" effects i could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005 ? come on, why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price (i guess) ? and those killer "muppets"... well, i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage. you can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but i don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. as for the "star" of the movie (i use a lot of quotes tonight...), lou diamond philips, the guy is not even remotely an actor. maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies. all in all, an awful movie. maybe i am in a bad mood tonight. then again, maybe not. a sincere 1 out of 10.

this is a truly awful film. lou diamond phillips simply calls this one in. the use of miniature models of the train are laughable. the plot seems to develop on the run (there is an alien on board; oh, and an eco-terrorist is on board too; oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh, and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead; oh, and that train has nuclear waste on it...). i mean, come on really! the alien monsters are not scary (although there are a lot of them), and the acting is abysmal. check out the guy playing the "next president" - do you really think he could be president? for goodness sake, he has spent his whole acting career playing bad guys!

"eh-heh eh-heh hey, dude - look at these aliens. they're like - biting the humans and stuff! eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh" this must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. it's utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. their reviews are too good. to give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some b-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills.but enough of that.this movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being so bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. the old japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. at least in those 60's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved upwards out of the back. those movies made fun of how bad they were. alien express (aka dead rail) seems to actually think of itself as a good movie - which makes it incredibly absurd.the effects were awful by today's standards. beyond awful. however not quite as bad as the 60's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. the plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as i've ever seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. i won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just wouldn't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). most of the acting was awful; lou diamond phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one.scifi channel is rapidly becoming the "cheap thrills channel", producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot. i can only wonder - why bother?don't bother with this tripe. it doesn't get any worse.

this movie wasn't good. i thought it'd be a cute disney movie just like the original. wrong. it was awkward for christina ricci, whom i expect so much more than this, you could just tell by watching. i think doug e. doug did the best he could. sit 5 year olds in front of the this, any older, and they might start to fall asleep.

`it's as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head.' -pattipatti (christina ricci) is a sarcastic teenaged girl, bored with her all-too-average little town. bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor lady's whereabouts. now, with the help of her precious cat `d.c.' and an inept fbi agent (doug e. doug) she must find her.that darn cat is a bad movie. it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat. there are, however, a few buds of talent in it. doug e. doug was good in cool runnings. his performance as `senga' was really funny. here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent. he does have a good scene when he imitates the cat, though. micheal mckean plays patti's father. his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. this poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed, gets arrested for picking up his own cat, and gets bitched-at by his snippy wife and still doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles. i wish my old man was like that. the only real good performance is christina ricci's. she entertaining as the ever-annoyed patti, but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down. you might also recognize peter boyle (young frankenstein, everybody loves raymond), the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers, in this movie. this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. even the cat isn't very good... i really can't recommend 1997's that darn cat. some young children (under 8) might enjoy it a bit, but every one else should look elsewhere. if you're looking for a good christina ricci movie, i suggest addams family values, the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow. if a fun family film is what you're after, try snow day, instead.

i really enjoyed the first film and when it turned up again, without thinking, or checking, i took a family of friends to see it. i was ashamed that i had enthused so much about it to them.disney processed the original film just like the human body processes a delicious meal - takes in something good and turns out ... well, you know. and by having a dark-skinned person as the fbi man, the results of fingerprinting the informant were subdued.taken as an isolated film, i suppose it is not too bad if one likes that weird sort of thing, but when one has read the book or seen the first film - horrible!

maybe it was the excessive weight gain seagal had put on. or maybe it was the horrible acting of wayans in an action flick. or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two leading characters? these and other considerations lead me to conclude that seagal should have never made this acting nightmare. true, the story line was good. yet, as an avid follower of seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his genre of clean, pure, healthy zen buddhist living, notably in his on screen discussions with wayans. (then again his real life affair with the "nanny" was inconsistent also!)if seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, then he should do what a fellow action figure did in "kindergarten cop"...put humorous material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way. otherwise, leave the wise-cracks and the futile attempts at humor out of it while chasing a serial killer. seagal is not a natural humor type of guy. it did not work.

kennan ivory wayans was so funny in low down dirty shame that i had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and steven seagal didn't help much. it starts off with some odd religious killings that don't make much sense to jim campbell (keenan). he is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but jack cole doesn't seem to be who everyone thinks he is until jack's ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well. it's the same thing as all of his other movies: smoke past, cia involvement and now trying to be a normal cop. why does steven dress up like he is from a western movie? and the prayer beeds on top of that make things a little confusing.

typical steven seagal fare: that is, it's crap. the plot relies on a series of incredibly improbable coincidences; there's a hefty dose of conspiracy theory which would be much more palatable if we didn't know that seagal takes it all literally; and once again, bad-movie multi-millionaire seagal tells us all about the evils of the rich.seagal's survival relies, as usual, on the fact that bad guys never fire their guns from out of arm's reach, and always like to give a little "i'm gonna kill you" speech before blowing a man's head off.watch this one right after the even-worse *fire down below* and note how the carpet in keenen ivory wayans's apartment is more flammable than a big puddle of gasoline.oh, and watch in the final fight scene for the incredible disappearing forehead wound, which is probably the most entertaining thing in the film.

imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made seven where instead of a talented cast and crew they've cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leads . if your imagination can't stretch that far just watch the glimmer man as it's the next worse thing !!!! mild spoilers !!!!jack cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's played by steven seagal since he's also someone witrh a hidden past , but don't tell anyone because it's top secret . perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like seagal became a movie star in the first place since the glimmer man continues in the vein of all of seagal's other movies in that it's utter , utter crap . look at the way he's introduced as his partner walks into his office " yoi love beads man . in you're in the wrong office " steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty , or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away . in fact the only time i could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage " don't make me kill you " is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman ? i'm just thinking that in another movie where steven isn't the hero ( ie a good movie ) the cop would say something along the lines of " don't kill me , i've got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home " . so anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows . it goes without saying that you shouldn't try this at homeas the story progresses steven ( i've given up on calling him jack though credit to the screen writer for giving steven a sensible name ) becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers . as steven finds more victims you can see him thinking " what was that movie that starred morgan freeman as a cop ? " as he inspects the bodies , oh and the action keeps switching back to the hero's domestic life just so we know that this guy's good as a family man , this guy's very good as a family man such a pity he's so bad as a movie star

a not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early steven seagal films because there is not a very good set piece. steven seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law. in my opinion the performance of keenen ivory wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film. bob gunton is okay as the main heavy. the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer. my favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the russian mafia. one of the film reasons to see the glimmer man(1996) is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus nikki cox. its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them.

total garbage!!! no reflection to washington heights what so ever. if i had four arms, i'll give it four dumbs way down. acting performance worst than storyline. truly over rated. hour and a half of visual torture.rather watch ben aflec movies for the rest of my life. feel bad for the films that lost to this crap. what were the judges at the film festival watching? total garbage!!! no reflection to washington heights what so ever. if i had four arms, i'll give it four dumbs way down. acting performance worst than storyline. truly over rated. hour and a half of visual torture.rather watch ben aflec movies for the rest of my life. feel bad for the films that lost to this crap. what were the judges at the film festival watching?

starring tomas milian and manny perez  'washington heights' is a low budget drama set in a latino neighborhood in nyc.a young comic-book artist (manny perez) wants to escape his latino neighborhood. when his father is crippled by a robber's gunshot, the young man is forced to run the family bodega.the movie was shot in a budget (low resolution video and poor audio) with low profile actors.the plot flowed well for 85 minutes but the last 5 minutes were just terrible. we don't know for sure if perez and his girlfriend remained together and if angel ended-up in jail for the shooting.4/10

i walked out of this movie and i did this only one time before with the australian movie sweetie close to 20 years ago. after about three minutes i felt like killing the camera man and just couldn't believe that this film actually showed anywhere and- guess what - was nominated for two independent spirit awards. what???? regardsless how realistic the dialog might be (i will never use the word "dude" again!) -who wants to listen to these conversations? i don't go to the movies to be annoyed but that's all i got. the only good thing i came away with was the realization that if this movie can make it to sundance and other festivals, anybody can. well, wait, that might not be a good thing after all...

i saw this film at the 2005 edinburgh international film festival. this film had been compared in the eiff program to sideways - which i liked - so i was quite looking forward to this movie. i also liked garden state, napoleon dynamite etc... so i have had good recent experiences with slightly weird american indy films.unfortunately, i found that puffy chair does not compare favourably with any of these movies.i was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something amusing, witty, insightful or even mildly interesting to happen. it didn't - and the shaky video cam was making me sick - so i left.this is only the second film i have ever walked out from (the first was "showgirls") which is slightly disappointing. i probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the wobbly picture - but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that i would be missing anything.disappointing.

this movie is ridiculous. it's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible. the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it's a comedy. truly is bad cinematography. you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there's a few jokes here and there going on but either way they're all inside jokes amongst themselves. this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. it really is a very pointless movie.their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway. unless you want to be bored out of your ass, i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.

plot:- a chair from ebay- random people- random people talk (" dude, it's right. " "i'm feeling it." "lets get married now!")- if you are a "hippie" then you will love this movie. (you must be high or drunk, otherwise you will question your life watching this junk.)this movie was clearly not thought out from the beginning to the end, and the other comments are probably the crew padding the reviews. if this wasn't aimed at my demographic, i don't know what it is aimed for. i found the plot everyday boring. it's something that i would do, and trust me it's not worth filming. going on a roadtrip and filming half of the silence does not make a movie!

imdb lists this movie as a comedy. i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isn't comedy. tragedy maybe.i won't say whether this is a good movie or not. all i know is it is not a comedy. i wanted a laugh tonight and what i got was some bizarre notion of someones attachment to some ugly chair.this movie is not what is advertised. it's film school tripe that i can only assume is intended to "make people think". i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that i know, or even that i don't know. it's ridiculous drivel that makes no sense whatsoever.it made me think alright. it made me think, "i wish i had those ninety minutes of my life back."i'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal bent on their world view that will make this movie something worth watching to them.i am not one of them.

so then... this is what passes as high art for the likes of sxsw film festival and sundance, eh? well, i suppose i can relate as long as story, script, dialog, acting (save for ms. aselton), cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant.i remember telling other film-making friends some years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we were now going to have to wade through a future sea of crap to get to anything worth watching now that anyone and his brother (or brothers in the case of the duplass') could run out and make a movie. "the puffy chair." need i say more?this feature length video is yet another chapter in the dismal, ever-expanding world of "dudeology" movies; young guns armed with a dvx100a, a few thousand dollars, a hastily written, shallow script, and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voilà!, instant feature video-makers. don't get me wrong -- i'm all about independent cinema (i.e. hollywierd sucks). but having said that, you can't argue with some of the realities of that system. if the duplass brothers would've had to have gone out and raised a real budget and bring on real producers, its clear a script like this would never have been green-lighted! and therein lies the problem. there is no longer such a thing as a vetting process for getting films (sorry... videos) ready for production. just grab a dv/p2 camera and off you go! and what makes it worse is that high-profile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. and why? precisely because its no-budget. i think its important, especially in todays climate of indie films, to quit allowing video-makers to high-jack the language by labeling themselves, "filmmakers." there is quite a difference in my book. when you have to go out and actually put your script on the line, asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a feature "film", knowing the potentially losses at stake, then you will know what it means to be a "filmmaker." but dropping a few hundred at sam's club for some dv tapes, some soda and chips doesn't cut it. oh... and by the way... i have to mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a female being addressed as "dude" throughout the entire movie. even mark borchardt reserves that intensely-overused moniker for his male friends only where it is at least endearing where his buddy mike is concerned!i think its high time the indie film community started to call out these shoddy, no-budget videos for what they are, and simultaneously scold prestigious festivals for giving such casual efforts, high praise. either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups... "dude films."

in spite of many positive reviews this is a very slow film with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialog you will ever hear. this is another road movie that really goes no where. the camera frequently goes out of focus and the constant panning in some of the over long scenes is annoying.the three characters are attractive but note likable. the cast also sets what must be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word "dude". (even howard stern has abandoned this tired pesudo pronoun).the three primary actors and one supporting actor show great promise. they are clearly comfortable and bravely allow themselves to be depicted as shallow and even goofy. the character actors all seem as they are plucky amateurs who generously volunteered to speak a few lines.. indeed they all physically fit their roles well.all in all a dull 90 minutes that seems more like an eternity. this is among my ten worst films of all time.

i saw this at my city's independent cinema - no surprise, because no mainstream theatre would want its fingerprints on this train wreck.the camera work is very distracting. the constant shifting, refocusing, and zooms could induce a sensitive person to have motion sickness. it looks more like a film student's project than a serious movie.though well-acted, the characters are unlikeable. josh is devious, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. without any context to emily and josh's relationship, she comes off as a whiny, insecure girl who's desperate to get married. rhett is an emotional infant, incapable of understanding the complexities of human interaction. without any redeeming qualities, i didn't care about what happened to any of them.obviously some people liked this movie, as the couple sitting behind me were laughing hysterically. of course, they could have just making fun of it. i could hardly blame them for it.

i'd love to sit down and write an intelligent, well thought out review however, i feel i'd be spending more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did. i live in los angeles and i'm sorry to say that the characters seemed just so much like underemployed and overly ego inflated actors. there was not one moment in the film when i could escape the feeling i was watching the drivel ridden conversation of unemployed actors at a hipster la coffee shop. one of the worst "indie" films i've ever seem with so little to recommend it that hearing it won at sundance has effectively removed any prior interest i may have had in attending, much less considering a postitive sundance review to be meaningful. watch at your own risk.

"the puffy chair" was a supreme waste of 84 minutes of my life which cannot be retrieved and spent in a more worthwhile way (even "the blair witch project" was a better use of life's precious moments). it must be called "the puffy chair" because only 'puffy' chairs could accommodate the extremely 'puffed-up', self-important brothers who drooled it out for public consumption; and, obviously, they are so full of themselves that they have assumed the public would actually want to consume their drool. "the puffy chair" made "the wooly boys" seem like a cinematic masterpiece! "valley of the dolls," "beyond valley of the dolls," "pink flamingos," "texas chainsaw massacre," "night of the living dead," "urban cowboy," "the blob," -- all of these would be a better use of one's time, than viewing "the puffy chair." the characters portrayed are either too predictable or too lacking in normal, emotional reflexes to even come close to being likable or believable. also, at one point in the film, while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town, if one watches closely, one can see that one part of the town is apparently in the southern united states, and the other half is located in maine. that's some town, eh?

most films are crappy with high production values, this one is crappy without high production values. which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies. as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn aselton who, i believe if given the proper script, could probably turn in a pretty good performance. she plays emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus josh, who often refers to her as "dude" or "man" in a non-ironical tone.but heres the thing, emily is a semi-believable character which means rhett will soon need to be added to the cast, to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh. when we first meet rhett we learn that he is "deep" because he is videotaping a lizard which is proof that he sees the world "uniquely!" rhett then shows the tape to emily and in one of emily's few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard, wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied.from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy, we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy! oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy! haha. this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be (and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit, i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome).i believe sxsw gave this film some minor award (oh south by southwest, why do you encourage them, its only cruel). but here is where i hand this film a compliment, it is the best of the mumblecore movement. mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting, but still, its good to be the best of something.i haven't seen baghead yet, but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward, the preview at least made it appear tolerable, where as even the puffy chair preview couldn't really hide the fact that it was going to suck. i've gotten off topic here, anyways rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all, much like josh most likely isn't an actual actor but rather the director (or brother of director, there's some mixed messages there). i think rhett was somebodies buddy and they said hey why don't you play this guy named rhett in the movie, the fact that rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same, unless i am mistaken, which i am not.if rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive. so anyways rhett, emily, and josh team up to bring the puffy chair to rhett and josh's dad. some stuff happens along the way, more bad acting, bad supporting actors, crappy camera work, an attempt at significance. this film wouldn't have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance.the whole thing is amateurish, if you can view this movie without paying for it, like if its on tv or for rent at the library, then consider looking at it, just to see if you like this super cheap style of film-making. i like what the duplass' are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept, but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see.

when the puffy chair beckons, beware of its soft, colorful upholstery.the movie starts out quite well. josh (mark duplass) and emily (kathryn aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. an argument occurs one night and in order to make up, josh asks emily to come along on a roadtrip to his father's house where josh plans to deliver a purplish lazyboy recliner for his dad's birthday. emily accepts and along the way they pick up josh's flighty brother rhett (rhett wilkins), an amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than his own.the roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between josh and emily, as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until josh "convinces" the original owner to refurbish it). rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of emily and josh's problems is the lazyboy and sets it to the torch one night ...and that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film.the big issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair, when it isn't the chair at all that takes center-stage. it is josh and emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at josh's parents place on his father's birthday without a gift. josh never mentions the chair, nor does his father. there's no connection between it and the lives of these people. so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isn't there a tie-in with it at the end? bad script.the other annoying thing is that mark duplass' brother, jay duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable.the acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. all of the actors/actresses did fine jobs. but the poor production quality, stilted ending, and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems.

although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget, that's not what i go to movies for. there wasn't one character i found sympathetic, they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers. everything they attempt ends badly, it's all too hopeless for me. reviews refer to the puffy chair as a black comedy...comedy? the brother rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution. when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother, he almost hints at rhett not playing with a full deck. nonetheless josh performs a "wedding" for rhett and a woman rhett met just a few hours before. there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road. however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film...and i saw it at a free screening.

this low-budget indie film redefines the word "blah". it will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the dictionary, defined as: "nonsense.. uninteresting, dull, lifeless". the movie redefines the word because i would have to add to those four words: "pc crap", "pretentious on a pathetic level", and "pointless".the film tries so hard to be "hip" and "in touch" with contemporary beautiful-people-struggling-for-je-ne-sais-quoi behaviour and "thinking" (do they think?). there is almost no plot to speak of, though there is one to sleep to. the phoniest and most politically-correct things about it are how a white woman is great friends with a young, black stud, the black street-sax-player with a penchant for oh-so wise council and advice, and the fat black psychic. isn't it beautiful how the races can get along after all?... ahhhh... in the end, the woman reads out "poetry", which is nothing more than one of her dull "dear diary" entries. she gets a standing ovation(!!!), although in real life her listeners would have more likely than not dozed off into deep slumber. but this movie has little to do with real life, even though that is where it's supposed to be happening. in real life her "poetry" reading would have gotten standing ovations only if she had the sense to include the juicy, sexual details. "and then i rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty, impatient pink little vagina..." cheers! what's worse, the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes or screws with someone, yet they never have the sense to show her breasts, which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess.the black guy and the blonde, who are separated by about a meter in height, hook up: they look like a cheap variation of rodman and madonna (as if the latter two aren't a cheap enough combination already). nicole eggert, mentioned by howard stern in his "miss america" book, is the blonde. stern writes of eggert that she took her implants out. yet i believe that when they took her implants out they also sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles by mistake, for she looks starved here.the sax player in one scene develops angel-like wings; he looks like al roker advertising angel food cakes.

the only interesting part of this movie was it's jazz and reggae new orleans back drop. it tries to be one of those movies that has two struggles the heroine has to overcome, one from the past and one from the present which she fails to do convincingly. the acting's bad and the direction is even worse. i'm not surprised at all that this went straight to video. the end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced including the actors themselves.

this movie has a few good performances going for it -- and that's all it has going for it. the leads, especially pauley perrette, are appealing. (although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter.) the material -- that is the problem. i feel as though the screenwriter/director watched the entire run of felicity in one sitting, then sat down to write a script without catching any sleep. it really did remind me of felicity -- a thoughtful young woman finding herself, finding love, with a shake-them-up-and- see-what-happens approach to the characters and their relationships. except that while i usually enjoyed watching felicity, this movie left me cold. the writing is just awful. it's amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did, as the dialogue is dull at best. at its worst it becomes trite, stilted and amateurish. there is nothing original here, with plot elements recycled from gimmicks that weren't so brilliant to begin with. (angels and fortune tellers? come on.) for the first half of the movie, i rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. by the second half, i just wished for it to end already. my sympathies to the cast, who deserved a better vehicle for their talents.

it was the first action movie made in banned in ussr hollywood action style. it is not even close to the hollywood action movies of that time. the plot is childish, the directing is so-so. this movie succeeded because it was first of its kind in russia. even though i watched it many times i have to admit it was kind of naive and i did not like it. this is not the best example of russian action movie. this is just the first experience.

officially the first martial arts movie in ussr cinematography featuring actual martial artists like tadeush kas'yanov and russian bruce lee - talgat nigmatullin. bad people highjack a ship in the high seas but fortunately just about everybody on board is a trained martial artist. a collectible for martial arts aficionado.

the only positive thing i can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now i finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie i ever saw was called.it would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable...a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even. why would anyone want to produce such waste? i refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented. making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point. anything else just doesn't make sense.

this movie is about people living at a trailerpark. later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out-of-work comedians, mainly old males. well, more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f***ing. but never there is any action, just those people talking. in the beginning i thought it's some cool perverted redneck-stuff, but after a while it got boring. i mean, how many versions can you think of saying f***ing, d**k & c**t? for sure, this can be funny - for half an hour maybe, not 80 minutes. but it was funny to watch those people trying to act. i'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing. but it does not disturb the movie, it's cool like this. because those individuals seem so poor, f***ed-up, crestfallen a***oles that the style totally fits. their wooden, helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere, i fell in love with the characters a little.***spoiler ahead*** later in the movie the f***ers do some comedy-shows (rhymes about f***ing) with just themselves as audience and imagined applause. then one gets an eviction-advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs - armed with some weapons. then they got shoot. fin. sounds like action, but it's not. just some trashy home-camera takes. ***spoiler end***but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and i'm pretty sure it's just what the movie-maker wanted to have. it's the portrait of those f**k-ups in an groggy home-camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch. but the texts about - you know what - the whole time get boring after a while.pretty young director who also seems an interesting person, as he played some teenager-stuff in popular movies/tv-series but now got in more horror-movies which is more his cup of tea i guess. and this, his first direction-effort will be distributed by troma now. don't know anything about a release, i got this one as an "advance screener" from this years cannes which says "for bootlegging purposes only".

another of those flimsy stories coupled with most forgettable musical numbers. powell and o'keefe as battling publicists are quite forgettable. however, there are two shining moments. hubert castle is the most incredible tightrope walker you will ever see - his "drunken walk" on the wire has to be the most spectacular piece of balancing ever recorded on film. he has to be seen to be believed. the other is sophie tucker doing a turn near the end of the film. her magnetism, her professionalism, her sheer talent at being herself - well, charisma is not learned - you have it or you don't. a great lesson for all would-be cabaret artists. a sad note: w.c. fields in his last film cameo is completely forgettable.

this piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again. the only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission. i was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and i was free to vacate the auditorium. what an unmitigated bore; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. when i die, i pray i can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish.

sherman hemsley was great in the jeffersons and especially all in the family. he was also very good in amen, why on earth would he do this movie? this movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. luis avalos does the best he can but this is awful. this movie was the beginning of bankruptcy for sherman hemsley. i think he is very funny but this is an awful awful pointless ghost story. stick with ghostbusters.

this movie is só incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry, the cliché are put on thicker than 5-year old peanut butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart, every single joke was badly timed and wouldn't have been funny if it were timed correctly.don't see this movie, there's a real chance you'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again...ever.

i was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather actually picked this horrible piece of crap for us to see one night at the theater. he never picked another one again! it was that bad! anyway, my friend then told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage. i thought she was kidding. it turns out, she was serious. she had never actually seen it, and she said that it put a quick halt to her father's writing career. i told her not to waste her time. but, if she did actually break down and watch it, she would see within the fist minute why this ended her father's days as a writer. i mean, even for the 1980's, this crap is bad beyond description. i mean, joe frazier as terrible tucker? and why in the world would two cops care one bit about a house full of ghosts? and the movie poster? a ghost with his tongue hanging out? what is that about? nothing about this makes any sense. well, i told my friend that this crap not only ended her father's writing career, it ended the careers of everybody involved. or, at least none of them ever fully recovered from being in this garbage of a movie. let's just say that i will forever ridicule my friend for revealing to me that her father was a writer for this movie! that alone should tell just how bad this is!

especially if you love horrible movies. when i first started watching it, all i could say was "i hope there's a dance sequence in it." imagine my delight when not only did the two main characters dance, but the main ghost began break dancing as well. and on top of that, sherman hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song). it makes me a little sad that he went broke because of this movie, but i've never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better. not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other films he directed!).one note of warning, though, the writer seemed to really like jokes about the, um, male lower regions. for example, one of the characters discovers a book called "groins of the darker species." i am not kidding. and that, to me, is the most disturbing part of the film. other than that, find the most obscure video rental store in your town, get the movie, invite all your friends over, and laugh until you cry with ghost fever.

i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old. i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters (and the star trek universe, in general). even in "the undiscovered country" i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release. however, having said that, "star trek v: the final frontier" is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew. i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk, spock and mccoy is well handled, but the overall script, the direction -- by william shatner -- and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode. this is a "buddy movie" and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie. the action sequences are not sustained and therefore, build little or no tension. the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs, both intended and not-intended. the klingon's seem thrown in as an afterthought. the whole "sha-ka-ree" concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill, a fine actor in everything else i've ever seen him in, boarders on the absurd in this movie. the scene where sybok conjures up images of spock's pain and mccoy's pain shatters the image of the characters as we've known them. spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy, trying to save his father is full of insipid, redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelley's acting abilities. the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters. i understand that shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but that doesn't allow for such a bad story. in some respects, i think this story does fit in with the old series, but the movies, including "star trek: the motion picture" are all much better quality than this. it's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. the focus on kirk, mccoy and spock is nice, but way over used. the old crew really seems to be out of character. i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar. i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. if this was a tv episode, i'd be able to accept a lot of the faults. as a movie, this is just bad, uninspired film making. it's a shame too, because i want this movie to be good. even if it was the level of "star trek iii" i would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare.

welcome to the plan 9 from outer space of star trek movies. come on, trekkers, admit it. this movie is so bad, so staggeringly inept in every department, it's become something of a classic.the shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid. "boones! hi, bones" brilliant! this isn't just ham - it's several large pig farms in kentucky! the "special" effects. should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term. the enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. really! even the star trek tv show had better.bones, spock and the shat sing! yeah, spock sings row row row your boat. after struggling over the meaning of the words!!!! "capt. life is not a dream" poor leonard nimoy, he must really want to strangle shatner for this. could the shat not have given us his rendition of mr. tambourine man, or harmonised with nimoy on ballad of bilbo baggins? sorely disappointed.a sean connery look-a-like plays spock's half-brother. only cos they couldn't get sean connery! uhura does a fan dance! that would have been sexy in 1966. in 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a christmas party.cat woman jumps on shatner's back! shat twirls her around a few times like a wwf wrestler, and chucks her off. yayy the shat! seems connery 2.0 was a bit of a vulcan rebel. which explains why spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies. mccoy apparently mercy-killed his dad, but afterwards they found a cure. tell me this isn't hysterically funny.the 11 deck enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. spock's antigrav boots amazingly support bones and the shat as well. should also have used em on the humped-back whales in star trek iv! shatner meets god! or what purports to be god, but i assume is really some kind of alien being. god looks a bit like charlton heston in the 10 commandments. sean connery the 2nd calls on god to share his pain, and promptly dies. or something. god punishes the shat for questioning his identity. so spock kills god with a photon torpedo. i'd love to know what jehovah's witnesses made of this scene.the shat, having killed god, promptly goes back to his sing-song with spock and bones. altogether now, row row row your boat.....

from all the rave reviews, we couldn't wait to see this show. we love wacky humor and creative material, especially from australia and new zealand.i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes. but we just couldn't bear any more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a tv show - it felt like 15 hours. the songs may be (mildly) interesting by themselves, but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work.we're trying hard now to erase the memory. if you want some wonderful down-under humor in a delightful and engaging film, see "the dish" instead.

this show is perhaps one of the most boring, most unfunny shows i've ever seen. while the humour was subtle, and i'm all for the subtle humour; the jokes just weren't funny.the show is about two kiwis in their mid-thirties living in new york trying to start their music careers.i saw the one episode where brett leaves the other kiwi behind during a mugging. okay, the plot idea has potential; but i got the feeling that half the episode was just filler, and the other half was actually important to the story.what i mean is, they kept on explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust for the other guy. i've got one piece of advice for the writers: mention it once for the idiots who can't figure it out by the way he's acting, and move on.and i found the characters were annoying. the character who left the other behind, brett, came across as being overly innocent and naive, the one left behind walked around talking in this monotone and robotic voice.a third character, who was the band manager, was obviously incompetent, but he was the one character that i liked. he's also the one that earned the show a one-star rating.all in all, a show i have no intention of ever watching again.

i tuned into this movie not because i am a fan of u.s. high school basketball (in fact i only rarely watch nba games) but rather because i am a fan of gene hackman, who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances. in this case, however, i was sorely disappointed. this was not one of the bright shining stars of hackman's career.in fairness to him, he didn't have a lot to work with. as norman dale, the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in indiana, he wasn't called on to do much acting. basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting at the referees. i didn't find him particularly believable in the role to be honest. i also was unimpressed with the requisite romance between dale and myra fleener (barbara hershey). quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between hackman and hershey. the romance never captured my attention, and neither did the basketball "action," which was altogether too predictable.there were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile. i never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the townsfolk had for dale, almost from before the time he arrived. the character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. how many shots of kids shooting baskets do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie? there was no suspense: is it even possible to doubt that hickory is going to win the big one? i realize that this is based on a true story, but i guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie. quite frankly, it just wasn't a very interesting movie. definitely a movie gene hackman would like to forget.no better than a 2/10 in my opinion.

a poor basketball movie. a gruff coach with a dubious background comes to a small indiana high school basketball team in the 1950's and coaches the boys to victory by "breaking them down first, and then building them up."not a bad subject. photography ok. but the plot is totally predictable. no real sub-plots. nothing added to make the movie exciting. you know what is going to happen from the very beginning. suitable for 4th graders.

a coach who used to be good, but has had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of no hopers; the star player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy who gets kicked around scoring the winning basket; the whole town against the coach (all except for the leading lady). it's the old story - right out of the british comic books, where a team of speccy geeks and fatties take on the brazilians at soccer and win.this film, admittedly well put together, is full of these clichés. the only part i didn't predict was when at the town meeting, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. no reason was ever given. it seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way hitherto. maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy.gene hackman plays a locker room popey doyle. i am sure that an actor of dennis hopper's calibre found nothing particularly challenging about his role. the same can be said about barbara hershey.all in all, a film full of clichés that might have been done a lot better than it was.

if anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen. there are different aspects a sports movie can take. whether it be professional or college or high school. examples of sports movies i liked (and i haven't seen many) are jim thorpe: all american, all the right moves, any given sunday, eight men out, and rocky, among others. all of those movies had a little more than just plain sports. whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness, or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach, or the effect of money on professional sports. in hoosiers, there is not much content. it didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end. there was no character development, all of them were forced on us. i could sum up this movie, by quoting a very bad coach: "go out and try to score more points than the other guy."

being an american service member please believe me when i say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines returning from deployments.that being said....this movie is one large steaming pile of cliché. the acting as awful (with the exception of the little girl) the character's backgrounds are weak and laughable, and plot is ludicrous.this movie is so bad i made an account with imdb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it.canadian writer/director francesco lucente should be really, really, really ashamed of this movie. if he disagrees with us foreign policy, he should write a letter to the us government, not punish the entire english speaking world with a monumentally crap film.

badland is one of the worst movies i ever seen. most of the time this is fine and i can go on with my life, but i feel the need to warn others in this case. as a veteran of the iraq war i feel it necessary to say that the story, plot, acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage. it was as if the director/writer/whoever latched on to whatever cliché about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with it..not to mention i would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film. the "marine" uniform looked like it was fresh off a surplus store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first iraq war. i won't go on forever, this is a horrible movie. if you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives. i recommend going to your local library.

last night, i attended a screening of badland with my cousin. we were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director/writer, the producer (his wife), and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and q&a after the movie. but once the movie was over and the credits started rolling (and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and i, without consulting each other, immediately got up and left. we found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion, we couldn't even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left.i have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which jerry slices his daughter celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail. it was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her, and taking her with him when he fled. i've sliced my palm before (accidentally); even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life. but after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band-aid, it was as if she'd never been cut. my anger reached its peak--i won't spoil this moment for you--in celina's final scene.i got angry because celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film (the actress portraying her is a good one); i wasand you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know thisimmersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, by treating celina's emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, cavalierly and with utter disrespect.sure, the script has moments of tears for celina, and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting, somewhere, somehow. but by this time, we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down. the manipulation starts very early on in this movie, when jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that jerry had psychiatric problems. rule one, screenwriters: give your audience some credit. let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own. tell the story; don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel. we don't like it.my cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on, dialogue-wise, when jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides f*** this, f*** that, f*** you. some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths. but it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. some of them are really funny; the cursing is ancillary. but some of them substitute cursing for humor, and this screenwriter, to carry the metaphor to its conclusion, is no chris rock.this husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters. but they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience.i worked with vietnam veterans for five years, i've heard more stories than most, and i'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience. it's important, on all kinds of different levels, that we hear them. but i am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand. next time, pay more attention to the details.

i'm assuming the filmmakers heart was in the right place but, frankly, this movie is truly unconscionable. i was offended by the tone and the total cop out ending. you cannot take issues like this so lightly! without knowing the final caveat of the movie... we watch as a guy guns down his 9 month pregnant wife and two sons and are supposed to follow him for the next 2+ hours as he tries to establish a new life?? you cannot have sympathy for a character who does this. cannot! not to mention, we're given nothing until the last say 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie, as to why this guy is suffering so much. no flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - stuff that real vets are suffering from. all we know is he has a pain in the ass wife and can't financially take care of her and his 3 kids. there really didn't seem to be any research whatsoever into what current iraq vets are going through.additionally, the movie suffers tremendously from a heavy handed and totally inappropriate score. its a catastrophe. it is truly harmful to some actually good acting on the part of the male lead and at times joe morton. it foreshadows everything you're supposed to feel, and sometimes gives you the wrong clues entirely! again, this was a brutal thing this guy did, and so seeing him get a new job, meet a new blonde, struggle behind the counter making toast is not appropriate! and really, the ending? what a freakin cop out! how dare you.there are far richer films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers, please don't bother with this one.

hi guys, this is my first review and i would had to have picked the worst movie to review. as i only watched 5 minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere. the acting was deplorable, the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of 10 year old's. no offence to 10 year olds.i just couldn't take anymore i got off my couch, took the the house of adam dvd out of the dvd player and threw it in the garbage. maybe if you are a colin farrell fan this movie may interest you, because the character in the movie, anthony, is a colin farrell look a like. but that is as far as it goes, he certainly will never have col's acting abilities. i gave this movie a rating of 1 (awful) only because there were no minuses in the drop down list cheers.

first and foremost i am a gay man, although do not live my life within the so called "community", and it's because of films like this that gay themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are crap. like this one. f i could give this a zero i would. (i do not understand all the positive comments, unless they were all made by people who made this film) i actually stopped this at the 24 minute mark when the so called straight "anthony" kissed adam outside the restaurant for no reason at all. and how is the son stealing from the diner if he doesn't even live in the town? wire transfers? the acting was horrendous! the sound editing? (listen to "anthony" and adam when they are sitting on the fence eating their lunch. every time the camera switched between the two so called actors the sound changes, like there was not a filter on the microphone)seriously do not rent, or god forbid, buy this movie.horrible horrible horrible acting and just a stupid storyline.

notwithstanding that "the house of adam" is meant to be a mainstream gay movie; that anthony (john shaw), who is gay curious and a major cutie-hunk and adam (jared cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in looks; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, convincing, and naked lovemaking (sorry, no frontal) between anthony and adam 41 minutes into the movie (that alone may be sufficient for many of us) --- notwithstanding all that (to which i give a thumbs up), "the house of adam" is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard. a big thumbs down.shaw's and cadwell's acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script, direction, and editing, or rather the lack thereof. their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing, and may have more to do with their really being into each other, considering the rest of their scripting and acting.writer-director jorge amer's (bonus feature) self-congratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall.so, the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down. overall, the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for shaw and cadwell. alexis karriker as nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. far and away the absolute worst, and insufferable, acting was by thomas michael kappier as albert ross, anthony's father having not even of elementary school acting quality. he truly represents a colossal casting failure.the actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well.if only the production, editing and post production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been quite something else. the trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place. that, and the hope that this gay-centered movie, was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals.overall, the movie is a big thumbs down.is it worth buying/renting and watching it? only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between anthony and adam. or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies.

corridors of blood aspect ratio: 1.66:1sound format: mono(black and white)london, 1840: whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (boris karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers.riding the coat-tails of a gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of hammer's the curse of frankenstein (1957), robert day's corridors of blood is an odd mixture of historical drama and grand guignol theatrics. producer richard gordon lured karloff away from hollywood - where his movie career had become stalled in a b-movie rut (voodoo island, frankenstein 1970, etc.) - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control. in grip of the strangler (1958), he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history, while in corridors of blood, he's a drug-addicted surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by east end pub landlord francis de wolff. less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings, the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills (a leg sliced open, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the narrative is motivated chiefly by karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery.produced under the title 'the doctor from seven dials', the finished movie went unreleased until 1962 due to indifference by distributors mgm, by which time co-star christopher lee had earned a prominent screen credit, despite playing a small - but significant - role as 'resurrection joe', a sinister cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de wolff's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors. lee filmed this glorified cameo before the curse of frankenstein catapulted him to international stardom, which accounts for his limited screen time, though his intense performance is one of the film's highlights. adrienne corri (vampire circus) distinguishes herself as de wolff's partner in crime, and there's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles, including francis matthews (dracula: prince of darkness), betta st. john (the city of the dead), finlay currie and nigel green. superb art direction (by anthony masters) and cinematography (geoffrey faithful).

simply put, i was amazingly disappointed. i'm a huge fan of asian horror, and i can watch unoriginality (i myself enjoyed "the red shoes" and "phone"), but this was just poor.the movie has a lot of elements that are very high-quality: the photography is eye-catching, the visuals are cool, the directing is inspired, the acting is pretty good, the music is easy on the ears, and the cgi is incredible. but, since this is a horror film, we are expected to be scared, which just won't happen with this film. as with most south korean horrors, this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end: there's the trademark long-haired vengeful female ghost, ominous clumps of thick, black hair and puddles of water, and near the end, a twist that *almost*, but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing (the twist is easily one of the best qualities). and to the viewer's irritation, when the film isn't recycling (at times, so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized) imagery from other movies, it's making you jump. a lot. and by jumps, i don't mean things jumping out or anything, just very loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air (there's even a few "made-you-jump" moments that are simply infuriating). and when it is not ripping-off other movies, it's boring, and hard to sit through.and it's a shame, because "ryeong" could have easily been really good, and it has everything to make it good, but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie. a perfect example of how good it could have been: there's a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse, and without a sound, the corpse looks back. it's wholly predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. and unfortunately, that's as scary as the movie got for me.admittedly, "ryeong" has a few good features, and even a couple jumps that aren't as predictable, and do work. there's a very good and sad back-story used to explain the events, and the twist is pretty unpredictable. those are the only things that separate the film from any other asian ghost/horror film. but the problem with these is, even though they do work, they have been used before (j-horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by "a tale of two sisters"), and it takes the back-story a good fifty minutes to get going.so in the end, "ryong" really seems like a truly wasted opportunity. tae-kyeong kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions, so the audience won't notice the huge flaws. but he failed, and well... we noticed everything.my rating: 4/10.

this movie starts out with this creepy song that gave me some chills like the song used in "nightmare on elmstreet"! it immediately sets the mood! the sequence that follows also shows what to expect! we are made aware that a ghost is present! the mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together! but the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it! the ideas behind the plot are quite interesting! only the way it is told to us is far too abstract! i understand that the director believed that he had to maintain the mystery as long as possible! the problem is that when certain matters get revealed you never get a satisfying explanation! the motives of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the movie don't get answered at all! since we don't learn enough about the characters it becomes hard to care for them! and as a consequence you will loose interest! only some scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure! the twist is interesting but no real shocker! the experienced viewer will see it coming! some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like "ringu" and is not original at all! well it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie! but there is a main difference! the suspense in "ringu" mainly was based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters get killed!! in "ryeong" (the "ringu" like) twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another crazy twist! "ryeong" heavily depends on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't contain enough scares to hold your interest! simply put: this isn't a scary movie!

to call a film boring is not something i would usually count as a valid criticism. however, when a film is crassly made of spare parts from other films that weren't that good to begin with, and it is slow as molasses with no real payoff, i think it's fair to call a spade a spade. and the ghost is a very boring film.a movie that is about as original as its' name, the ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being haunted by a ghost that holds the secret to her past. only, it's a whole lot more complicated and less interesting than one would think.the plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the picture and the hook, the amnesia element, only makes things worse. it seems that no one, including the screenwriter and director have any clue what the hell is happening at any given moment. instead they chose to do what roughly amounts to the filmic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. there are scenes taken directly from ringu, dark water, shutter, the grudge series, and a smattering of pulse for good measure. making matters worse, the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike, making them impossible to tell apart.there is just nothing to grasp onto with this film. the story isn't all that well thought out. the amnesia gimmick is lazy. the mystery element is un-involving and handled with little grace. the characters never deduce anything, all the information is just handed out through the lead remembering her past whenever it is convenient for the plot.the cinematography, full of reflections and shots of water at least attempts to add to the subtext, a thematic link with the amnesia and the final twist (which i won't reveal) is nice, but often overwrought. even the score feels borrowed and cliché.worst of all, the inciting action for the curse isn't very interesting and the final twist is predictable and lame. "wait, you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end? no!" audiences are too savvy for this kind of tripe. anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature. i used to think shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap (remaking his grudge film no less than 5 times) but even his second rate work like reincarnation, a film i couldn't even bring my self to finish, is miles ahead of this.for more reviews please visit www.collider.com

the authors know nothing about russians prisons, the movie is absolutely cockamamie, has nothing common with the reality. they also don't that the foreign prisoners in russia have a special prison so the foreigners never live together with russian criminals. the uniforms in this movie look if they were stolen somewhere in latin america. prisoners in russia also don't work outside the prison. each kill in russian prison is a subject of investigation so the prisoners kill each other only if there some very important reasons. playing soccer is also forbidden in the prisons, contacts between the prisoners are very restricted, no chance for bloody combats etc etc etc. so this movie has nothing common with the reality.

two things are changed from then.first of all i am not a kid anymore,and second most of new seagal movies are just terrible.this is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with derailed starred by jean claude van damme.there is no plot in this movie,the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch.i love action movies,but this is not an action movie....this isn't a movie...this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies.i am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie.he has a serious intelligence problem then.i hope that seagal will make some new good movies in the future.good luck for him !

why on earth does five us keep repeating this one? the title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you never heard of and that resembles to nothing.you'll see ninety minutes of changing locations, most of them will be blown up later on in the movie. right in the beginning you see a nice little farm typical for the berry, which is in the movie moved close to paris but then it does not survive the "transport" to the isle de france very well: it explodes 1 minute later. there are also two gangster who have no tongues, as if that would make sense in the world of sms and internet, let alone pencil and paper.it just goes on like that, nothing makes sense in this story. my only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.

i believe cockpuncher to be the best piece of work that has come out of the steven seagal factory in a long time. this movie was the first one i have seen since that fine film preview. my point? he is done. every movie is the same. maybe he will be good in machete because he won't be the star. we can only hope.p.s. thanks for speaking to ucsb when i went to college. it was an amazing speech. you really influenced some people out there.so i have to write ten lines about this movie? umm....i like the smoker guy who killed a bunch of fools. whenever anyone smells menthol's look out. because there could be a killer with a silenced glock (and another loud one) who wants to kill you.is that ten?

"the foreigner" is a tale of foreign intrigue with seagal at the center as a deep cover operative who has a package which everyone wants and are willing to kill to get. the flick is uninspired with less of the usual action stuff which put seagal on the movie map (fire fights, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and more of a story which is convoluted, uninteresting, and full of meaningless filler. what action there is seems token and gratuitous while seagal, looking more and more like a pork chop, meanders through this insipid flick expressionless and bored while manifesting no improvement in acting ability. somewhere around "the glimmer man" or "fire down below" seagal flicks took a nose dive and "the foreigner" is just an continuation of that trend. nothing here worth watching except for the most die-hard seagal fans. (c-)

sigh... what can i say? why does a horrible script such as this gets approved in the first place. its not wrong to have a complicated plot but its not explained to the audience properly!to have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad. to have such a tight editing for the fight scenes is bad too! such fanciful editing only appears in trailers. it cheapens the whole look!and who are the russian guys at the top of the movie? who is the guy being tortured? is he with the cia? this film deserved not to be released in theatre. but it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place. its a joke to hollywood.

like another reviewer, i really wanted to like this movie. i went with my father who was the biggest lover and booster of classical music but neither of us could stand this movie. i wouldn't even call it a movie. a better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces. as i recall, the camera never even moved. rather, i just sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece. the only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little wavelets lapping at a beach. i'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few inches high at some nearby lake, and again using a stationary camera. truly pathetic. i can't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five. when we walked out, my father and i were completely mystified as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie. i don't know of of any good movies about bach. the world really does need one, but just because it doesn't exist is not a reason to see this one. someone will make one someday. until then just keep rewatching _amadeus_.

"dogmatic," as another reviewer described this film, is a fitting word. the director's idea was to present bach without plot, acting, fun, theatrics, dialog, narrative, or drama. mission accomplished, monsieur straub. "pretentious?" yes. "cinematic?" no way. this is anti-cinema. no one moves. hardly anyone talks. the camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: very very occasionally the camera will dolly in. you may catch a glimpse of gustav leonhardt's fingers moving over the keys. that's it.if you like the idea of staring at the back of a harpsichordist's (bewigged) head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to bach, this is the film for you. i'd rather listen to bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.

pdq bach did it better. much of "bach"'s speaking part is letters written to various patrons complaining about the amount and speed of his payment. anna magdalena's diary, mostly about the death of children and sundry other family matters, is an iota more engaging. the music is disconcerting: 17th century sized chapel orchestras and choirs producing 20th century concert hall sound. the overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show. j s bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. this film adds nothing. netflix sent me 2 discs that wouldn't play, so i streamed the movie. clearly netflix was trying to tell me something.

utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process. while it is true that the sat's is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college, what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewing.college admissions officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process. the film is an insult to hard-working high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have applied for. this movie certainly deserves rejection on all levels.

sure this movie may have had its funny moments with the sat question people and i know the movie is not supposed to be totally believable the movie made it too outrageous for example a girl like that would never in a million years go out wit ha guy like that also people in movie had lackluster performances there acting was so bad. also the plot bad they could have don e a better job on the scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and got really boring after the first few jokes, it was like 10mins was laughter then the old when is this gonna end started to kick in the bottom line if u want a a lackluster of acting mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie.

dooley and his canine partner, jerry lee are together again in this 2nd sequel (?!!?) i sincerely had no clue that they made one sequel let alone two. and for a film that was only slight better than "turner & hooch"? this time after dooley retires, he has to mate his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait around for jerry lee to poo. real classy stuff. i mean come on now. the original had at least a few good laugh. this one has nary a one. jim belushi just looks old and worn out. both belushi brothers were great in the '80's. if john hadn't died, would he be so bad today like his brother? that thought makes me sad for some reason.my grade: d- where i saw it: usa network

the film's title makes it sound like a porno but it's not even a sex comedy. instead, hot summer in barefoot county is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest moonshiners. the moonshine though is coming from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. almost anyone can guess what happens next but oddly, the film is very tame. it hardly even qualifies for a pg rating. what's more, the low budget is obvious in pretty much every shot and the acting is sooooo amateurish. this film was probably intended for the drive-in crowd but it's unlikely that it satisfied them, even in 1974.

'nuff said. an undercover cop from the state capital is sent to a small county where moonshine running is rampant. he ends up getting run off the road by some local hicks who have no idea he's an undercover cop (so they just drive away as blissfully dopey as ever). he is soon being taken care of by a woman and her three daughters who all wear low-cut tops and short shorts (gotta luv the '70s). he falls in love with one of the girls but in the meantime he still has to find out who's making all the moonshine and driving it to all the local bars and restaurants. he also has to contend with a fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy who think he's the moonshiner 'cause he's new in town.life in small town america, 70s style. yee haaaaaaaaaaa.

one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3-strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria gambarelli! i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this now-forgotten performer (though the spelling of the sommer character's surname was actually gambrelli). i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing "la cucaracha". that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances (like that of ms. gambarelli) that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bull-fighter (yeah, right!) and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume. only funny part of those two is when they cry-with buster providing handkerchief to "bull"-during the sad part of "la cucaracha". also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars. (healy himself didn't know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts "four" between "the" and "marx"!) speaking of a marx, it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head. also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year (at least when announcer pete smith identified her). oh, and smith himself wasn't funny with his wise-guy narration. other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m-g-m contract players either! so with all that said, la fiesta de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3-strip technicolor.

when i was 13 or so i was lucky enough to find this film. it was part of an endless danish series of really cheesy stuff. this however was the cheesiest i ever owned - but i guess i sold it, too bad. well what to write... better than "manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "critters 4". but it's definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it. the acting isn't that terrible compared to several other eighties trash - in fact i kind of like the old man even though he did'nwt look that indian to me. but i guess you can't have everything... do yourselves a favour and look this up...

it didn't take too long after halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continuous mediocrity. as early as 1983 the genre was already struggling to release more than three decent offerings per year and by '88 the stalk and slash flick had become pretty much the whipping boy of horror cinema. by that time major studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, which left it up to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that john carpenter had created. although there was still an impressive number of features hitting shelves in 88, most of them were weakly produced and taken as a whole they were eminently unappealing. with that said there were a couple of gems amongst the rubble. scott spiegel's intruder in its uncut form was a superb gross out classic, whilst evil dead trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely run out of style and panache. william lustig's maniac cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later dead girls and mirage proved to be the last beguiling breaths of life in the ailing category.it was the continual release of schlock like berserker, blood lake and rush week that cursed the slasher movie to eight years of obscurity. it finally took the big budgeted flamboyance of wes craven's scream to provide the necessary resuscitation. having not heard anything about demon warrior before i came across it unexpectedly, i instantly assumed that it was part of the low brow trash that led to the downfall of the slasher phase. but with that said the movie boasts an intriguing premise that sits comfortably beside scalps and camping del terrore as another welcome addition to the native-american influenced catalogue.a truck pulls up on a woodland road and out step two laughably dramatised rednecks. the hillbilly lumberjacks are only on screen for around for ten seconds and then they are murdered by an unseen menace. next we meet a troupe of five young adults that are heading to the same location for a spot of shotgun-target-practice on some of the local wildlife. the area is owned by neil willard and has been passed down through three generations of his family. his grandfather stole the land from an indian medicine man that was rumoured to have left a curse on the property. according to legend, every ten years a demon warrior with an extreme hatred for mankind stalks the forest reaping revenge on those he deems responsible for the pilfering of the tribe's home. it wouldn't be much fun if those myths were a falsehood, so regular as clockwork a maniacal assassin turns up with a taste for blood. will the kids be able to stop this phantom killer?demon warrior is best described as a bigger budgeted (but still woefully cheap) re-imaging of fred olen ray's scalps. the bogeymen from both films are virtually identical and the director even throws in a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. things start promisingly with some crisp friday the 13th-style first-person cinematography and a couple of shock-jolts that were composed with finesse by director frank patterson. thomas callaway did a good job with the photography and the tribal-drum score makes a refreshing change from the more traditional late-eighties synthesizer rubbish. flourishes of suspense are juxtaposed with a couple of credible directorial embellishments and there are even a few attempts at humour. the killer looked successfully creepy in demon attire and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a deft touch from the director.fred olen ray's notorious slasher was notable for its stark and credibly unsettling atmosphere. unfortunately despite being produced on twice the budget, demon warrior never comes close to the film that it so desperately emulates. rumor has it that the majority of the actors were drafted from the texas baylor university and were not even paid for their inclusion in the feature, so of course it goes without saying that the dramatics are appropriately abysmal. i especially enjoyed the hilarious john langione  an 'italian' native american (don't ask) that portrays about as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. warrior started with some credible glimpses of panache from the director that actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher index. unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of heinous acting and an ending plucked directly from stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan i had in mind for a rating. it's a shame that the dramatics were so scraped from the bottom of the thespian barrel, because at times demon warrior showed flashes of potential.all in all, patterson's movie is a mixed bag of ideas  some of them were good, but mostly they were staggeringly mediocre. because this was released at a time when the slasher genre had been watered down to avoid the scissor happy censors, there's really no gore worth mentioning. even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to olen ray's graphic depiction. demon warrior has the odd moment of credibility, but not often enough to warrant a purchase. not as bad as the aforementioned berserker, blood lake et al, but not really that good either..

i like a lot of myrna loy movies. this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed. it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it's complete form.myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job. that is about all you can say about her.her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws, such as the jewelry shop scene.this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment.

into a happy household comes the gypsy girl, played by myrna loy. with her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very high-pitched and weird, it's hard to believe this is loy!! she bears no similarity whatsoever to the refined and funny character nora charles who she played in the thin man movies. instead, she overacts so badly that you'd almost expect her to be in an ed wood movie. what a huge difference a few years made in the quality films she got as well as her acting ability!! on top of the horrendously silly character, the film also fails because it just isn't interesting or exciting--just very, very stagy and stupid. the only thing good about it is the vitaphone sound system--making the sound quality of this turkey about the best i have heard from 1929. heck, it was even better than most 1930 films, so the sound technician at least has something to be proud of--all others, forget it.this is a movie that even the host of turner classic movies referred to as a "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! and, after having seen it i disagree...slightly. the movie is simply bad.

as if the world hadn't already got enough cheap jaws imitations, writer boaz davidson decided to make the sequel to his ropey-but-reasonably-enjoyable creature-feature octopus a complete rip-off of spielberg's classic, right down to having a concerned cop who no-one believes, and a mayor more worried about his 4th july celebrations than people's lives.even in the hands of an extremely skilled director, it is unlikely that this derivative rubbish could have been anything other than hokey b-movie garbage, but with yossi wein (yes the yossi wein!) calling the shots behind the camera, a man with a fraction of mr.spielberg's talent (i estimate about 1/10000th), octopus 2 is guaranteed to be every bit as bad as one might imagine!the predictable and extremely clichéd plot isn't worth describing in much detail (substitute jaws' amity island with new york, and bruce the shark with a giant rubber octopus and you'll get the gist), although several points about the film are definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are so funny: all of the octopus attacks involve the actors struggling to make incredibly fake-looking giant tentacles look real, which is hilarious to behold; bulgaria's capital, sofia, unconvincingly stands in for new york, and overuse of stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing; best of all, a silly dream sequence that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero atop the statue of liberty, is not only gut-bustingly stupid but also features some truly dreadful special effects.davidson's script also doesn't know when to quit: there are several points in this film at which it could've (and probably should've) ended, but the action goes on and on, with the octopus surviving several explosions, and causing a tunnel to collapse (trapping the film's love interest and a bunch of kids), before finally being blown to smithereens by the hero.sometimes very silly, always awful technically, but never actually scary, this stv stinker may find fans amongst those who actively seek out cinematic trash. most normal people, however, would be advised to steer well clear.

oh wow, the character shares my name first name! nick! this movie as bad as the first one, if not worse. well, at least there's an actual octopus in this movie. an actual octopus that makes a better appearance in this film. by better, i mean, "longer" the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to sit through. just to let you know, when this ninety minute film ends not only are you freed from your couch but you get your ability to breathe back. not only that, but you realise how stupid you are and then commit suicide, realising how horrible life is after watching this film. really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more crap like this is being realised and where the hell have the real masters of horror been lately? this film should have been the final straw, so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in horror cinema, that could make some actually good modern horror films, this movie bites.

just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the michigan bar exam. i wanted something that was mindless and that i could just sit back and say, "what the hell were they thinking?" i was not disappointed in this undertaking, but had i been watching this one in a serious mood, i would have been irate. the company that made this thing just spliced cgi footage from the first octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in "bride of the monster" look like a masterpiece of special effect footage. since when does an octopus have fangs? the plot is that an nypd diver is investigating some murders/disappearances on the hudson river shortly before the fourth of july. he and his partner (who is soon to be transferred, or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the mayor's office. of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor's office. surprisingly, all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.really lame. don't bother with it.

a flesh-eating octopus, where does that guy boaz(what the..?) davidson keep getting inspiration? anyway,even for the low,low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people-genre and me,this one is just beyond awful.the octopus is one of the lamest,laziest,weakest monsters i've ever seen.i think he just ended up in the (ahum)east river because sea world got sick of him.the actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them.bunch of idiots,that way he'll never learn!you guys want all the other giant killer octopuses(that's the correct plural,by the way)to laugh at him?meanies.up to stop the octopus are wind,razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent nick hartfield and his partner,who will retire in a week but first has to be eaten by the octopus.hooray,octopus won the fight!a couple more and he's going to evolve(the scars in my mind stay).nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing(doesn't he have a gun or something?)but no,that magically doesn't help either.okay,enter sea cop's love interest rachel starbird.is this based on some comic book or something?anyway,together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park.they hope this helps,cos it's the 4th of july in a couple of days,and the octopus might join the party.and you don't know what he's like when he's drunk.rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't end while nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops.but all's crappy that ends crappy,nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times,and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh.you know,on tummy-vision,this would probably get an r.in real life,i'd say all ages but i kinda like all ages so my final idea is:suitable for absolutely nobody.there's no sex,no gore,no nothing.now forget this movie ever existed.join the club.

other commenters have described this movie as "classic 1950s scifi" with clever use of stock footage and documentary footage, and clever character interaction.nothing could be further from the truth.yes, this is classic 1950s scifi...but 1950s scifi at its most blindingly stupid worst.consider that the mantis's first prey is a radar station shown first from the air, then on the ground... but the station is (from the air) pictured as on a mountaintop, with snow on one side and semi-cleared dark ground on the other side, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the site, it's suddenly on a flat, evenly white plain, miles from the nearest mountain.consider also, the ludicrous pseudo-scientific babble of the highly-recommended expert who is brought in to examine a huge claw. he says "well, we know one thing... it can't have come from an animal, because every known species of animal has a bony skeleton. even reptiles and birds have bones." he then goes on to say that some creatures ...snails, shellfish, insects... do not have bony skeletons. excuuuuuse me ? let's define "animal", here. not even in the 1950s could anyone over the age of six take this man as an expert in biology, since he clearly doesn't know what an "animal" is, nor have the ability to name several broad categories of animals who lack bony skeletons (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, mollusks, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms....you get the idea.) the characters are cardboard, 2d stock types... scientist, sidekick girlfriend, big bad monster. nothing here shows any sense of creativity. no pulse, no life signs.there're no witty dialogs, the special effects are silly even for their time, and the stock footage is employed with a reckless disregard for continuity. this is b-movie making at its dead worst, with a production crew that clearly couldn't be bothered to try even halfheartedly.use sparingly, as sleeping medicine or punishment for small children who're easily offended by bad science.

this movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining radar and it is quite awhile before you ever see the deadly mantis. probably a better movie in the 50's this dated piece is a bit to slow moving and the pay off in the end isn't very good. though it has its moments like when the guy from perry mason argues with an old man and when he says "i have narrowed the possibilities to one" excuse me, but when you narrow something down you have a couple or more possibilities not one...if you get it down to one you haven't narrowed it down, but you have in fact figured out what it is. the monster is standard 50's sci-fi fair, better than say the grasshoppers in the beginning of the end. acting is sub-par and the heroine is the most unattractive...in fact in some shots she does look like a guy in drag. you see plenty of fighter plane stock footage and other things, but you won't see much at all of the deadly mantis.

something strange is happening in remote areas of the arctic. an air force weather station is found wrecked, its occupants missing. an eskimo village is destroyed. a fishing vessel disappears. curious spoors are found in the snow. a four-foot piece of a living organism is found near a destroyed airplane. the piece looks like half of the claw of a giant alaskan crab. the military (craig stevens as an air force officer) and its experts are baffled. a distinguished scientist (william hopper) and his pretty assistant (alix taltan) are called in from new york. hopper deduces from this flimsy evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous praying mantis. he's right. the pretty assistant happens to look out the window of the office and sees the hideous face with its bulging eyeballs staring in at her. she drops what she's carrying, claps her hands to her cheeks, and screams in horror.the mantis begins flying south along the gulf stream, pausing now and again to attack major population centers like washington and new york to overturn buses and eat people. military weapons don't affect it much but finally stevens crashes into it in his jet fighter and mortally damages the beast, which comes to earth and occupies the "manhattan tunnel" linking new york and new jersey.stevens, having survived the collision, leads his team into the tunnel and kills the big bug with "3rg mines" despite its fierce appearance, threatening behavior, and earth-shattering roars. stevens and taltan kiss in front of the body while hopper chuckles and takes their picture.ho hum.like the deadly mantis itself, the formula by this time was panting and gasping for air, flopping around, seeking as its prey not human beings but anything at all in the way of a fresh or original idea. as it is, they overlooked one cliché. hopper should have hurriedly had to invent a super duper ddt that, alone, could defeat the insect. that's what the 3rg mines should have been filled with, rather than ordinary explosive.the model work is pretty good, considering what the budget must have been. not much money could have been spent on anything else because everything else is pretty routine. craig stevens is bland, a face and style made for a tv series. william hopper looks right -- tall and silver haired -- but his instrument has only one note. the pretty assistant is rather plain, considering her role. the part calls for joan weldon or laurie nelson. they couldn't act either but carried with them slight but distinct intimations of molestibility. anything would have helped this fagged-out movie.i wish the deadly mantis hadn't roared so loudly and so often because you can't roar -- you can't even whisper -- if you don't have lungs. i didn't mind, though, when the monster met its demise in the tunnel. a praying mantis is a graceful insect in its own spindly way and it's great to have them in the garden because they eat caterpillars and whatnot. but when you get right down to it, they aren't really very appealing. the male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female, as in humans, and when the couple are just about through copulating, the female bites the head off the male, also as in humans. but at least human males know when to stop. the male mantis keeps on copulating for several minutes even though he is now without a head. we humans don't have mindless males copulating with goal-driven females. do we?

a giant praying mantis is awakened from its sleep in the artic region and heads south causing havoc. boats, planes and trains meet their match with the flying creature. before unleashing its full wrath on nyc, the mantis meets its doom at the hands of the armed forces in a new york tunnel. the special effects are of course crude by todays standards, but for a ten year old boy in 1957 this was very memorable.starring are william hopper, craig stevens, alix talton and pat conway.

roy rogers (as roy) and sidekick raymond hatton (as rusty) join teddy roosevelt's "rough riders". soon, they get suspended in order to "round-up" the killer of partner eddie acuff (as tommy) along the mexican-u.s. border; they discover creepy gold runners in the process. notice how, even suspended, mr. rogers is able to get the rough riders to join in his round-up! this is not one of the better roy rogers westerns. the fighting scenes look like choreographed dances. rogers sings/yodels "ridin' down the trail", one of two relatively ordinary songs; and, a stand-out moment, overall. ** rough riders' round-up (3/13/39) joseph kane ~ roy rogers, raymond hatton, lynne roberts

i've never been a huge fan of almodovar, but, generally, i've always found something to enjoy in his films. unfortunately, i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken embraces then i would normally think i would.i find the biggest failure in broken embraces to be the characters and the lack of depth they display. the film is essentially a love story, one that is tragic, and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. i found this problematic from the beginning.in the opening scene, our 'hero' the director/screenwriter, mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met. his agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves.in the opening scene, our 'hero' the director/screenwriter, mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met. his agent comes in, and rolls her eyes, as the woman bashfully leaves. mateo babbles something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his 'true' love lena, played by penelope cruz, the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other.cruz plays lena the mistress to an industrialist named ernesto martel. from the outset, their union is rather a pathetic one, as martel clutches jealousy to lena, and lena avoids uncertainty of being on her own by staying with the much older martel. to skip ahead, martel finances a film for mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the film, lena. naturally, without any back story, lena and mateo fall in love. and, in almodovar's world it really is that simple. mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now mateo falls in love with lena, later it's revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair. her son responds to this information with a laugh and an, "oh, well." again, no depth, no understanding for any of these characters, it all just happens. from the beginning of the film to the end, i got no depth of emotion from mateo. he is flat, and doesn't act much different from one scene to the next.the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer, martel, is watching video footage his son recorded under the guise of doing a documentary of mateo. there are nice a moment of martel watching obsessively as a lip reading confirms his worst fears. later, lena confronts martel as he's watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks. some quite brilliant moments. rather contrived, but still really fascinating.unfortunately, for me, the rest of the film left me rather bored. i couldn't care about these characters or their situations, so no amount of cleverness on almodovar's part can make up for this lack of depth. i think if you're a fan of his work you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're like me, in between, then you'll find it lacking.

in short, this movie is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy.almodovar is easily the most important european film maker of the 80s and 90s. no other living director has shaped the style and contents of present-day european cinema more than him. it is therefore not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two lackluster films, but rather a complete and total disaster confirming that he has run out of ideas, out of humour and, worst of all, empathy for the characters he creates.that is not due to the complexity of the story. all almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize. this time, in fact, it's rather easy if you are familiar with his earlier work. "broken embraces" is a remake of "law of desire", only this time the director is straight and the jealous jilted lover is a millionaire.for those of you not familiar with that film, i'm doing a summary. if you don't want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. a blind man, who used to be a famous movie director, seduces a sexy buxom woman reading a paper to him after a chance street encounter (yes, really, that's how it starts). just then he gets a visit by his agent and best friend. he mentions to her that he has learned from the paper that a certain millionaire has died, which takes the story 14 years back. he can still see and is about to direct his next film. he stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the lead, as he is instantly smitten with her. the millionaire discovers their affair via silent videos made by his gay son, which he has lip-synched by an interpreter (a few great scenes: cecilia roth). after violent quarrels, the mistress escapes with the director to a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire, who produced the film, had it released in the worst possible edit, destroying the director's reputation. the couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director turns blind and the would-be actress dies. back in the present, he learns that his agent has preserved the film's negatives and starts to reconstruct it.as in "bad education", there are various sub plots to beef up this rather thin story, and as in "bad education", the result is more confusing than satisfactory. for instance, the agent's son, who works as a dj, has an accidental drug overdose - which is completely unnecessary for the plot, and also interpreted rather badly.mostly, however, the actors are not to blame, but the way their characters are written. blanca portilla as the agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule. lluis homar is an old man's dream of a protagonist, living in an artificial world where an english alias and a few sweet words can seduce any super model. and penelope cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy. her character is completely lifeless. it remains thoroughly incomprehensible why she would go from one old man, who at least helped her family, to a slightly less old man, who isn't charming enough to convince as either a romantic hero or a passion fuse.but all these shortcomings wouldn't make this film so awful. however, almodovar does the worst possible thing of a director (or any type of storyteller) running out of ideas: he quotes himself, something he has increasingly done, and to very little benefit. the film-within-the-film, which "broken embraces" uses as a plot-driving device, is actually "women at the verge of a nervous breakdown" (1988), only this time it is called "chicks and suitcases". this rather unimaginative title may give you a hint how this beloved classic is treated here: while the dialog making up the final ten minutes of "broken embraces" is a frantic, over-the-top exchange of screwball one-liners in the original film, here it is a stern, colorless, pesky business encounter.in conclusion, this is the d.o.a. brainchild of an exhausted creator of past marvels, pretty much as awful and disappointing as the last indiana jones feature. maybe not so many people would agree with that, because almodovar used to be such a genius. i'd rather offer my respect to his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to watch "all about my mother", or "tie me up", or "high heels", or "matador", all of which bear witness to almodovar's unique and unmatched talent. a few more film like this, and his legacy may very well be destroyed for good.

what can i say about the pleasure planet that i haven`t said about umpteen other tedious soft core porn films ? very little . it`s just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very unconvincing set scenes between male non actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who have obviously had silicon implants . actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members grind their hips together giving pained expressions like they`ve got constipation or something . no wonder a lot of people claim sex is over rated , they`ve probably watched too many of these films on late night cable stations

honest to god, the outline pretty much says it all. the planet andromina (not to be confused with aunt jemima) is represented by a cheap l.a. stripclub. there's no strippers, so the most recent male visitors go off to recruit strippers.the men get mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women (although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girl-girl sex scenes), and eventually, as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere, the women become convinced that men are good for something. well, not the men who made this movie, at any rate!but boy, do we get to see a lot of that something, in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity. this one has less plot then usual for such flicks, so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie, and grit your teeth if you're into this kind of thing.

what the hell is this!? that was my first reaction to this film (actually, my first reaction contained more swearing). this isn't star wars! star wars is space battles, this movie has none. star wars is the force, this movie only has a retarded witch with a magic ring. star wars is lightsaber battles, this movie hasn't got any battle worth mentioning. star wars is humor, this movie isn't. star wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has horses in it!!! besides all of this, how did lucas get the insane idea to let a five year old baby do the leading role !? big, big disappointment. do you like star wars? don't watch this! 1 out of 10

this movie is awful. at first i thought it may appeal to children, due to the cuddly ewoks, the fury little people from stars wars. after sitting through this monstrosity of a movie, i am certain that not even a 4-year-old would find this movie interesting. the special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well for other 80ies tv movies. the script is bad, the actors, especially aubree miller and unbelievably bad and the flick is so predictable that i still can't believe i was able to not touch the forward button on my vcr. however, i came close to switching this mess off more than once.

i have officially vomited in my own mouth, thanks to this movie.i expected the absolute worst with this movie, but i expected a heartwarming and pleasurable absolute worst. this is just terrible. absolutely terrible. terrible like nazis spreading the black plague. let me explain: ewoks are speaking english. it's horrible.the villain girl looks like she travelled from the future set of power rangers. i really really want her to rise up from the ground and say "at last! after ten thousand years i'm free! it's time to conquer earth!" the putties... er, i mean the big bad whatever the heck they are... they growl a lot. many of them look like an even lamer version of the cryptkeeper. the cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not.the only merit to this movie was paul gleason. this movie might have been better if he'd went to the bad guys and said "if i have to come in here again, i'm crackin' skulls." it would have been even better if one of the ewoks was played by judd nelson, who mouthed his words as he said this.also, that speedy little creature is pretty badass. word to that.no word to the movie, though. i want to give this movie a two. i want to, so badly. there's a passage i have memorized: the path of this movie is beset on all sides by the inequities of terribleness and the tyranny of spin-off awfulness. blessed is nothing, for this movie blows.

what a stupid idea. ewoks should be enslaved and tortured. utterly useless as a species... fine you want ten lines of text regarding my unending hatred of ewoks? fine, here it is, fool. first of all, they are an inferior race that would be slaughtered en mass had lucas not pussified the entire series with their foul presence. they're little bears with large asses, and they probably smell like donkey crotch. yeah, i said it, donkey crotch. they have little to no technology whatsoever, resorting to using sticks as makeshift weapons. i'm surprised they even had access to fire. their guttural language makes my skin crawl. can't...suppress...anti-ewok...rage! ahhh!!!

this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen. no story, no point, it wasn't even funny at all, not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked so much!! felix bean the main character sucked. susanna sucked. this movie was made in 1996 and it really was set in the 80s. what else, i'm never letting my friend pick movies ever again. hmm, the movie cover said it was from the producers from super troopers, who kidnapped them and stole their identities. wow, what a waste of time. the only minute thing that was funny was freaky ricky, he was funny, especially when he and emily ended up together. that was funny. all and all, it sucked, waste of time and sleep. wow, never thought a movie like this could be made, so dumb for watching for watching it to the end.

man was this hard to watch! it was not at all funny, not well made and it had no point or plot to it whatsoever. the acting was horrible. it was not well made at all. it looked like a bunch of kids my age were just screwing around and making a pointless movie. it is by far the absolute worst broken lizard movie. if you are a broken lizard movie like myself you will disappointed and bored to your death. please skip this pointless movie about ugly guys looking for chicks. you will not regret m advice. by the way, don't say you didn't find this review helpful just because you didn't agree with it. thats stupid, like this movie. the only ok scene was when the main guy was playing rugby and got beat the crap out of. i liked that cause i found his character pretty damn annoying.

even though this is the first film by the broken lizard group, it's the last one i saw. having mildly enjoyed super troopers, and managed to sit through the crap that is club dred and beerfest, i was surprised to hear they did an earlier film. now i didn't sit down with high hopes, but was hoping for a funny campus romp. my friend asked me to keep in mind they are younger (obviously) and its their first foray into film. i did and was still disappointed. not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the bl guys, they were ok. the whole film was tiresome, clichéd and frankly boring. some of the other actors in the film were really poor at acting. and the rugby game didn't even resemble rugby. poor showing. they improved drastically with super troopers and have declined since. lets hope they get back on form with super troopers 2

super troopers was an instant classic. club dread, while disappointing to many, had its moments. puddle cruisers has fewer moments. i saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the broken lizard group who made super troopers, so naturally i picked it up. i only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny. a far cry from super troopers. all in all, i was very disappointed. i would not recommend this to anyone, unless you have an abundance of free time, and really need to kill some time. however, you're better off playing video games, or watching something that might make you laugh or think.

pauline kael gave this movie a good review but it is terrible. it is very outdated , the humour is silly and the music is forgetable.in fact it is so silly it is almost embarrassing. it might have been some fun in 1938 but i can not imagine anyone enjoying it in 2003.

a bad movie, but with one reel that is worth savoring. for most of the film, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even w.c. fields is bad. then there is one sequence with bob hope and his movie-ex; the dialogue is witty and the song (a version of "thanks for the memories") light, cynical and delightful. who parachuted in for this one bit? yet it makes the whole thing worth the original 25 cents admission.

'ernest saves christmas' is comedian ernest's christmas special film. in this film, ernest has to find a successor to santa claus in order for christmas to continue. along the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of santa's (i won't tell you what that is; you'll just have to watch the film for yourself). like most ernest films, there is a lot of slapstick humor involved.this film is probably one of ernest's best films. it's funny, and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love. it's not the best christmas film around, but it is a good one to get you in the christmas spirit. it's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now.

this movie started off great; the first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. that's the good news. the bad news is that the film then gets too repetitive and then it gets downright stupid. what we wind up getting is a santa claus with "magical" powers with a lot of new age baloney thrown in the mix. it's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of "christmas movie" i would expect from jim varney's "ernest."to be fair, it still had a decent amount of laughs and is profanity-free but just not a film i could recommend.

i have seen this movie several times, it sure is one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties. so, i think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this one. but, if you are into great trash, "dragon hunt" is made for you. the main characters (the mcnamara twins) are sporting great moustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. one of the best scenes is when one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana. this movie is really awful, but then again, it is a great party tape!

with awful movies like this one being even considered let alone being made, it's very easy to see why hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes all the time.i guess the viewer is supposed to be laughing their rear ends off over the 'black' in-jokes, the 'pimped up' look and the 'bling'. it's so incredible 'over the top' and so bad that is even past the 'so bad it's funny again' mark and have plummeted right into 'totally embarrassing for anyone involved'.i'm very, very sorry for every single minute i wasted on this one. i want my time back !save yourself the agony, do not watch this. the only reason for me to give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 wasn't an option.

i watched this movie with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan and he was really really looking forward to catch the "soul" vibe the movie claimed to have. boy, we were dead wrong. when i finished watching the movie i felt two things: remorse and relief. remorse because i regretted wasting my time to watch this awful piece of dung, and relief because i watched it free on cable.this movie really really gives a bad name to black people, by putting so much awful stereotypes that i believe all smart black people everywhere has been trying to spell off. i'm asian, and i feel very very sorry and sick for those who made this movie. what more to say? bad writing, even worse acting, and horrible storyline.even if you're bored to death and has no other choice, don't watch this movie. seriously. the movie really has nothing to offer, except if you want to see things like minor illegal drinking, animal slain, women degradation, and overall: a really really bad-obnoxious-sickening-awful movie. yuck.

the movie starts off relatively well and seems to be getting somewhere when an african american passenger sues an airline for negligence. there is one scene in which his pet dog gets sucked into the engine and thats really a sad thing. but the way it is portrayed makes it difficult for one to figure out if that was an attempt at crude humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of negligence? after this point, they clearly ran out of ideas. if you stuck around long enough, you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made. it is basically a highly racist sequence of smoking dope, toilet humor, styling of each and every segment of the aircraft to reflect african american pop culture and pretty much nothing else. you'd think that the only 3 white passengers onboard would lead to some hilarious consequences but nothing of the same happens. they were basically just added to show how badly they could initially be treated and later be accepted into the hood if they behaved. avoid.

this could quite possibly be the worst movie ever made, up there in a league with movies like "howard the duck," "plan 9 from outer space," and "ishtar." i don't understand why i decided to see this movie, as it was a waste of my life. i also do not understand why one would like this movie, regardless of their sense of humor. the acting is among the worst i've ever seen, as is the writing. the characters are all stupid, and there is not one funny scene in the entire movie. tom arnold is quite possibly the worst actor ever-- this movie proves it. there is nothing worthy about this movie. don't rent it, don't watch it, don't even say that it looks interesting. it's bad enough i saw it.

is it just me, or is this an awful film? i'm going with it's an awful film...knowing full well that it's a guy flick (usually defined as full of car chases, crashes, gunfights, explosions, etc.), i still expect some small degree of credibility. if i can't somehow believe in the premise, the film will not work. thus, we come to the problem with "assault on precinct 13."not one for spoilers, i never report details of the plot. however, i will make an exception here, because the plot is so inane. bad guy is jailed in precinct 13. bad guy's buddies want to bust him out. surprise. the bad guys' buddies are actually corrupt cops. brooding, troubled, but heroic young cop saves the day while romancing the girl. ugh. yes, it really is that simple, and that dumb."assault on precinct 13" takes place in detroit. not a bad setting for crime and corruption (i spent 3 months there in late 2004, so i know what i'm talking about). even so, it's outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of detroit. i have spent a lot of time in downtown detroit, but i cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown detroit forest. i must have missed it...there are no refunds for watching bad movies. save your money. there were too many good films in 2005 to waste even $3.00 at blockbuster on this one.final rating: 1(only because i have seen worse films.)

i am a huge fan of the original assault on precinct 13. the ice cream scene haunts me to this day. i'm 33 now and i still remember being horrified by it as a child. when i heard they were remaking it, i thought it might be good but when i saw the film, it's 100% not the same film. it's not a remake. it's a bad stolen idea. it was completely ruined. the cast, maria bello, laurence fishburne, ethan hawke, gabriel burne, john leguizamo and drea de matteo are all great actors but even they couldn't save this film. it was just wrong. even the setting was completely opposite. and how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door? why didn't help show up sooner? stupid. no sense.

this was perhaps the worst movie i've seen in a long, long time. forget that it's clear no research was done regarding detroit (forest in downtown detroit! bwahaha!!). the writing was horrible, the premise completely implausible, and quite frankly, the characters were embarrassing. i cannot for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would stoop to such a low and participate in something this god awful. now, i have never seen the original and don't know if this movie pays tribute to it's original form. it's my understanding that the original was not set in detroit. why they would deviate from that without researching details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent. don't waste your time on this junk, unless you're from detroit and wish for some comic relief.

i think that saying this film has too many is not what makes this film bad. the twists are not the problem of the film. the story is quite clever and could have been very cool if filmed right. the major problems why everyone is complaining about the twists in the film is that the film is just not fascinating enough to make people follow them. the film is badly shot (at least in comparison to its genre brother lock, stock). worse: the characters are (although often well acted) just plain flat. the characters don't have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with a single one of them, let alone understand them. oh, and the locations are just terrible: locations-person (i didn't bother to watch the credits for your name) - get another job (maybe still photography or interior design)

they (dueringer, dorfer) are good stand-up comedians, young, not ugly, have money, the girls love them, the audience is appreciating everything there doingand then they made this film ...no story at all, some jokes were old in the fifties, the acting is awful. save your money for something useful, like a gift for your girlfriend.

if jacqueline mckenzie and john lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.the story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one,and well worth exploring.however on the negative side,the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses,and the music choices more and more bizarre,so that by the end i found myself laughing when i know the director intended for me to be crying.

this is a truly awful movie. the jokes are few and far between and the pacing is a down right endurance test. the only thing funny to come out of this production is it's comparison to the classic film "this is spinal tap."avoid this film as if it were one of the plagues of the bible itself.

joe rogan's whole act is profanity laced with bile. he is a pot smoker who entered fear factor, thinking it was a joke. he said he would egg people on because he did not know how stupid people were going to be. the producers of the show he explained were going on the premise of playing pranks on unsuspecting contestants to see how far they will go. the level of evil involved is a little twisted. mr. rogan's special is just filled with the rants of someone who is too good for regular human beings. i found him to be offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians such as eddie murphy or chris rock. rogan even does a five minute set on the n word. overall, ignore this special.

this person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to profanity, vulgarity, and slander to try and make others believe he has talent. i have often seen comics use a little of each with effect but when all you can say is laced with it, it is a sign of a drug affected warped mind. makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse. poor man!!! i admit i could not watch all of it - too stupid for words. the amazing part of this is that somebody actually believes he is a philosopher!!! no wonder self respect and decency are dwindling and perversity is rising. could it be that the ufc might have been a factor in his deadened brain?

i haven't seen many movies worse than this one. the story line, the dialogues, the acting: it's horror! the story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between. every time you think you've missed something, but no: that was the way it was intended to be. and why on earth is the character that jenny garth portrays so in love with that no-no loser guy (who actually now plays in the movie cinderella man with russel crow!)? o well, it's no spielberg, of course... i have to write ten lines to get posted. this movie really isn't inspiring enough to write 10 lines! it's a romantic feel good movie with a lousy story, so if you're up for that: you'll have a ball.

i accidentally happened upon this movie when i was looking for something to watch while eating lunch. i actually turned to the we network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of "sticking it" for some gymnastics team -- i figured cheesy goodness. well, i got cheesy alright. first, i missed a good 20-40 minutes at the start of the movie. luckily, most of it was recapped fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist.i love jenny garth and will watch her in just about anything. she's just so pretty, and i want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers always does. she looks great throughout this movie, and doesn't really age over what seems to be more than a decade. overall, i felt bad for the actors as i watched this movie. all of them tried to sell their parts, but all were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle. frankly, i was surprised to see terry farrell and mitch ryan (greg's dad from dharma & greg) in this. but the writing was not the worst part of this movie. about a half-hour before the end, her mother dies, and when they show the headstone the death date is 1979. having missed the beginning, i had gotten the impression from the wardrobe that this was taking place in the 80s. not one leisure suit or bell bottom in sight. shame on the person who did wardrobe for this film! don't get me wrong -- all the outfits in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for the time period. it almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe person that it was a period piece.bottom line -- good for a laugh or to feed a jennie garth fix. :)

it's schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? the heroine is cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother, sister, and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy.the cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. the movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout. megon mcdonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments.if you love danielle steel, you will love this film. if you love archetypal romance, you will love this film. i did not. i was able to sit through it, but it was close.

i lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! what possessed the filmmakers to do this? this is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. to fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall, her aid to burros, and, of course, her ten cats! do not see this film. and have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they do not have a clue. there are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and insights to share - but marta becket is not one of them. the people i took to this movie say they have forgiven me - but that they will never, ever stop kidding me about it.

"i remember waiting to be born..." "vision quest that was the american west." "we went to a psychic..." "i'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo" "...the place is haunted..." "i think there's another dimension right here." an artist (marta becket) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of new york and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in death valley. there, they renovated a theater--painting it is a very home-spun/folk art manner. and, once finished, she bega putting on dancing performances for practically no one. in many ways, it's highly reminiscent of the werner herzog film fitzcarraldo or field of dreams--though amargosa is a documentary of a real person--not a mythical crazy man like klaus kinski or kevin costner. her husband eventually leaves--much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose. so, today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually along with her new male companion, tom.what you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives. if you are into new age ideas and open to these sensibilities, then you'll more likely appreciate the film. her talking about how she remembers her birth, ghosts, vision quests and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people. in addition, her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to peta and many other animal lovers, though with my background in environmental concerns and biology, i see the burros and horses as a blight that would destroy the native plants and animals. so on two different accounts, i tend to think quite the opposite of marta--who is more of a "feeler" and "sensing" individual. depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions--and i am pretty sure most people will either think she's a genius or a nut! you'll just have to guess what i think.now despite all this, the film is interesting and marta's life is definitely not dull--particularly since in recent years, people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform. there is a definite following for her and her unusual little world. while i would not be nearly as positive as most reviews, i also can't be as negative as the one review, as there is definite merit to this odd documentary. i like films about unusual people and marta certainly is unusual! i also appreciate her love of her art and happy life--that is a rare gift. i teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staff--where i am pretty sure we'd get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film--probably depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core curriculum! it sure would be interesting.by the way, and i am not trying to be sarcastic, but when marta's husband was having affairs, with whom did this occur?! after all, they lived in the middle of no where and i was left wondering where he'd find partners.by the way, if you'd like to see her perform and/or stay at her hotel, it can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/ . the site is in english, french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices.

the satirical movie website dateline hollywood joked that "son of the mask" was all a practical joke star jamie kennedy played on new line cinema for his show "the jamie kennedy experiment." if only. and if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece."the mask" was the ideal vehicle for the face-pulling jim carrey that so many viewers dote on; it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing cameron diaz. so having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea, plus you'd have thought new line would have learned their lesson after "dumb and dumberer: when harry met lloyd." but no... though to be fair, having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic (in which the mask went from owner to owner). as written by lance khazei and directed by lawrence guterman, however, there's nothing there in return, except a steady stream of admittedly decent fx by the usual squadron of houses (industrial light and magic improving on the "ally mcbeal" dancing baby and their own "baby's day out," with the tippett studio, giant killer robots, digital dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company (responsible for such gems as "siamese popes"), naming his character after tex avery, and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips.the trouble is that last approach doesn't really work, partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat (especially the cars getting in the party mood) and mostly because the tributes to the flintstones, woody woodpecker, "duck amuck" and especially "one froggy evening" show up how weak this movie is in comparison. plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment (the underlying theme of the story is family; our hero isn't ready to have a son, and his nemesis - alan cumming as the norse god loki - is far from the apple of odin's eye... and what bob hoskins is doing here as odin, even after "super mario bros.," is beyond me), and kennedy just isn't in the same league as carrey in the zany stakes - though it's not like he gets any help from the script. also note that unlike diaz, the very cute traylor howard (as the mother of the son of the mask) doesn't get much to do; giving her the mask might have helped the movie.further points are lost for throwing away cumming, hoskins, steven wright and magda szubanski; for a suspiciously abbreviated running time (which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the "green guy" as an animated tv series - "the mask" did become an animated tv series in real life, and was a far better follow up than this sequel. the fact that this actually opened in britain before the us should tell you everything... what with this and "blade: trinity," new line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from "two guys and a girl." what next, "the butterfly effect 2" with nathan fillion?somebody stop this.

this "film," and i use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: "p.u., stinky poopies!" like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. that said, there are a few bright spots. the effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- i mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic cgi effects can be. the cgi baby effects are not great, but i imagine those are very hard to do well... although for a hundred-million bucks, they could have been better!moose, the dog from "frasier," phoned in his usual exemplary performance. steven wright did well with a small part. alan cummings was, well, alan cummings-as-villain, which we've seen before, and bob hoskins as odin was unrecognizable, but enjoyable. the actress playing mrs. avery was cute-as-a-button, as you'd expect, and jamie kennedy stunk, as you'd expect. his best role so far was in the scream trilogy (not to be confused with the lord of the rings trilogy), and in three kings. he should stick, perhaps, to more subtle forms of comedy. jim carrey, he ain't.the writing and direction were, if anything, worse than kennedy's performance. i semi-remember one clever (though seven-year-old clever) line that i wish someone would quote accurately for the "memorable quotes" section. something about avery's proposed costume being the "crappiest crap in craptown," it was a second-grade joke, but sort of funny in context.over all, since there's nothing lower than a "one," i give this film a "one."

"son of the mask" is a terrible excuse of a movie. i went to see this with my friend and i still wish we had seen "because of winn-dixie" instead. i must say that it is partially my fault, as i agreed to go see it with him. being a fan of the first "mask" movie (jim carrey was hilarious) i had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.ten minutes into the movie i knew it was headed for disaster. disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter, but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief.finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as i did is surprising to even me, as i loved "scary movie" and "anchorman", two films which many people i know found crude and offensive. but the thing is, "son of the mask" is not funny unless you're under the age of ten.the film features lots of cgi in it, but it cannot save this piece of rubbish. whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential, considering the success of its original. unfortunately, it has none of the laughs, fun, or excitement of the first, creating a mockery of the original movie. i recommend renting the original "mask" to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess.

son of the mask is a terrible movie. i don't like the baby and i don't like the dog. jamie kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage. even at only 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. the only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by ben stain. that's it. the rest is just a rehash of the first movie. actually that is just an insult to rehashes. why was this sequel made?? this movie cost millions of dollars to make. why would i sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy? jamie kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie. i am not bothering to be nice to this movie. 1/10

-so the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground. his super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life. one day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life. unfortunately for him, the god loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story. if that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up -this movie is terrible. there's really no other way for me to say it and i just can't stretch it enough. the only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played jamie kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching. i know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash. why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap. the original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling. this one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable bo gross i'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.-the cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up. if there was music, i didn't pay attention to it because i had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog. then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays. you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but i can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take. if new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out -bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost

this movie isn't worth going to the theaters to watch, i did and i didn't like it, the effects on the movie are really well done, and you get a laugh here and there, but the story is really bad, it seemed like they had run out of ideas, and what is that of loki and odin getting along? that totally destroys norse mythology, and i guess they forgot that loki's powers only worked during the night!! if you really must see this movie rent it when it comes out, don't go to the movies for this!they could have done a lot more with this than they did, it felt like they just wanted to do a movie to show off cool animation and effects

when a friend and i saw this in the recent releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before. we both like costas mandylor and it had james coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad. we were wrong. it was. it was really that bad. no actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. it was like taking titanic, the poseidon adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.i must admit that there were a couple of chuckles. i did laugh when the head cabin boy is asking alan (costas mandylor) if he's some "pussy marine." the other laughs this film got though had nothing to do with the writing. i would dearly love to know how the people making this movie thought that you could have a cruise liner knocked upside down and have it remain steady. it isn't tipped or anything.if you are looking for something to watch for costas mandylor, james coburn or any of the rest of this cast, move on. find something good that they did.

i'll give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be a one.i saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first "road" picture i've seen. i was expecting waaaaay better. robert osborn says this is the best of the road movies. if that's true i needn't bother to see the others. the best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie.i didn't like the movie. neither hope nor crosby came across all that well, their characters weren't very charming, the movie was not funny at all, most of the dialog was just lame filler, there wasn't much action, there wasn't much spectacle.the movie wasn't what i expected. i was expecting more "road," but there isn't much. they quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie takes place there, until the end. i was also expecting a lot more of the famous "road" style of breaking the fourth wall, wherein the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot. there was only about 4 instances of that. one of those is an example of the non-funny humor of this script:(hope recaps the plot up to now to crosby) crosby: i know all that! hope: yeah but the people that came in half-way through the picture don't. crosby: you mean they missed my song?those are two weak punchlines, but at least they are actually jokes. much of the rest of the script doesn't even have any jokes. an example is: crosby: remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (indirectly calling hope a rat).that's not funny at all, it barely even qualifies as a joke, but that's the kind of non-joke dialog that carries most of the movie. many of the scenes don't even come that close to a joke, just using generic uninteresting dialog like:crosby: hey, whadda ya' take me for? you think that you can just throw me to the dogs? hope: well why not, you did it to me didn't you? crosby: yeah but that's because i was lookin' out for us. you're not lookin' out for nobody. hope: oh yeah? well then why did i pay the check?(the above is just from my memory. it's not exact but it illustrates to you what i mean).and so on....just generic dialog with no jokes at all.my grade: a waste of time.

i'm a big fan of patricia hodge and mariam margolyes, so i watched this show when it came on a&e some years ago. the show was strange to say the least, but i gave it a chance because i liked these actresses. this has got to be one of the worst shows i've ever seen. i wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video. the storyline of this tv version is ludicrous and just plain stupid! the "kicker" (pun intended) comes when ruth has surgery done on her leg bones. that kind of nonsense belongs in james bond and sci-fi movies. if this version is true to the book, then i won't be checking the book out from my local library! the american version came out some years after i'd seen this original. to my surprise the americans got it right this time, as their version with meryl streep and roseanne is played for laughs and is rather funny. when played for laughs the storyline works.

i saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago, and it is now making a comeback at the local film club. it uses every cliché in the intellectual movie makers handbook (beginners edition) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be. you get your run-of-the-mill slow-motion tempo, brown color scale, slow pans through bombed-out environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic imagery, and the requisite miserable ending.it is a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical russian art movie. the director, aleksandr sokurov, has excellent command of technique, but he lacks eye. he doesn't see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pathetic.this movie is a wet dream for art film haters. it lives up to every stereotypical view of the genre that there is.if it was bad in an entertaining way, it would a turkey. but for a movie that is so bad that you walk out afterwards royally p***ed-off, we need a new term. this movie is a sokurov.

eddie fischer was simply bad. possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. the song was totally stupid... i think i could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a grammy. then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, fischer says something to the effect of, "don't tell (insert the guy's name). he doesn't like music" and smiles. i can't describe how bad this is, i felt a little embarrassed. and that guy debbie reynolds works with and who's always hitting on her is so annoying too. i can't even imagine someone like her wasting a fraction of time on him. the jokes were delivered without any sort of chemistry between characters which made the movie crawl by. at least the baby had cute hair. the two stars are for reynolds, who was like a swan among ugly ducklings.see bachelor mother instead.

i'm sorry but i can't agree that this was a good movie. yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and i must say the story sucked big-time. how in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. better story and i would've gave it a higher vote but i was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. i have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. all the scary scenes were shown in the previews. and why did the family that got killed stay to haunt the house? why did the father come back again? why did he decide to kill in the first place? why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first? to many questions, not enough answers. if i could've gave it a zero, i would've.

i almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line. there is not one... repeat one original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. the crows.... hitchcock did it superbly back before cgi and even with cgi this film falls short of a well done attack scene. the creepy crawly boy... the grudge did it and did it better. the psycho...done in cold creek manor most recently, however it has been done to death. no pun intended. disconnected/rebellious teen who no one listens to... about a dozen films have used this one right down to beetlejuice. the oozy stuff from the basement... can you say amnityville horror? doors opening unbidden... what lies beneath did it with much more flair. creepy farmhouse... too numerous to mention. the backdrop of metaphysics-- which should have been the central focus, gets lost once you figure out what is happening, which by the way is pretty early on.one thing (of many actually) they never even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked down the ooze in the basement, so they really don't have a body. overall... don't bother

this movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. all the attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes i ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through. at least i was entertained. the ghosts are attempting to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name i didn't care to remember. and what was with the black and white at the beginning? i know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. and where the heck did that guy (john corbett's character) come from? he just waltzes in from no where in a vast field. and why did he suddenly lose it again when the ravens came? and if the ravens were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if it would make him try to kill the family? makes no sense. so many things in this movie just don't make sense, and the acting ain't too pretty on the part of the main girl character. it's not terrible, just a little like her kiddy movie days. so all in all this movie wasn't brilliant, but i had a good time ripping at it, and sometimes that's all a horror movie needs to do. rent for entertainment not quality.

directors of "the messengers" danny pang and oxide pang are responsible for "the eye" and its sequel and their premiere american picture plays like "the grudge"-lite set in a farmhouse.a family of four move from chicago to a run-down sunflower farm in rural north dakota.almost immediately their teenage daughter jess starts seeing ghosts.of course her parents and the police are skeptical.admittedly the film is well-made and there are two or three effective scares,but relies too much on 'boo' effect.still the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climatic and stupefyingly awful.scares are on the low side too with a tendency toward cgi.overall,"the messengers" is a pretty weak horror film that simply doesn't deliver.4 out of 10.

well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. i was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this. i heard something about this so i picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from john fallon aka arrow in the head! at that moment i thought "well if he likes it then i gotta like it!" so i rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy). oh and i might wanna add that i read a little of arrow's review and it turns out that out of 4 stars he gave it 1 and a half. so my expectations from this movie went from very high to iffy. well after watching this, i once again agree with arrow (and turns out that quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about that!) wow, did this film stink or what? where do i begin with why it did so? well, the film was so dull in my opinion. not even the cool gore bits excited me and when a decapitation doesn't excite you in a movie, that's bad! the characters i hated a lot and from the beginning i could tell who would die and who wouldn't. actually the film proved me wrong at some points, but the worst thing is that one particular character i wanted to die didn't! what the heck? and the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? didn't feel it. he obviously was just there to be eye candy and give her a love interest, otherwise i thought he was a waste! and as a horror fan i should know that doing the "dumb horror movie" sometimes gotta happen or else there wouldn't be much of a movie, but the ones in here ticked me off! hello? why are you making out in the room of the killer nun when you should be on the lookout from her? and it was done by the supposedly smarter characters no less. the twist....ah, it would have been alright, if it hadn't been done a billion times and i didn't have to sit through this wast of film to reach that point! my main point: stupid movie that sucked me in with some words of my favorite (actually my only favorite) movie critic. jerks!

the only good thing of this movie is its final twist. in 97 minutes of film we can only save one single idea, which was totally wasted in this movie i must say! for more than 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clichés, bad acting, stupid ideas and disclosures, complete lack of suspense, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all this in a pathetic and unoriginal plot until the last three minutes, where, finally, a good idea appeared! it's nothing outstanding or an extremely original idea, but, at least was a "decent" good idea, the only one the entire movie has! i won't spoil it, but i must say i think that idea with a better plot, better fx and, definitely, a better acting, would turn into a good film. if you watch this movie and can stand it until the end you will know what it is

the movie is nothing extraordinary. as a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. nothing about it borders on scary... not even close to the threshold of scary...it's just another case of "another teenage horror movie"-seen one and you've seen em all. first few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. the worst part is, the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. would have been better if it's written in spanish. and don't get me started with the inside jokes and punchlines.though i will give a little credit for the special effects. but trust me, like any other hollywood made horror movie, cgi's and special effects has little or no effect to a horror movie's ability to scare. in fact, it makes it worse.between the fresh faced anita briem and the spooky location, there's not much to see in this movie.

i am a huge horror fan, particularly spanish horror. this film had so many possibilities to be good. it's a marvelous idea, a vigilante ghost nun, as most of what has come out of jaume balangueró's mind. both visual and sound effects were also pretty good. but everything was shamefully spoiled by bad direction, awful casting and a painfully bad (exposition, exposition!) script. too bad. maybe balangueró should write and direct himself a remake...moreover, i don't really understand why this had to be spoken in english by actors who can't really speak english (and when they do, they do it so bad it just makes their performances even more fake). if you look at contemporary spanish horror films like el orfanato or rec, the performances are totally in tune with this type of stylish ghost story - and that is being realistic, being believable as someone like ourselves, like real people, because that is the only way horror achieves it's goal. unfortunately, everything failed in la monja.

i didn't buy this, i didn't rent this, it was on ppv and someone burned a copy of it and loaned it to me, so at least i wasted no money on it. for someone that did darkness, the nameless, devil's backbone, this is a pretty lame film. seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls that were at a convent back in the day and now they're all grown up and they're being pursued and killed one by one by a nun that comes out of the kitchen sink, the toilet, and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel. and what makes this nun so mean and nasty (and wet?) i dunno, this was so boring that at some point about halfway through i just stopped it, put it away, and watched something else. wasn't even interested in finding out, really. oh sure, there's some lovely young ladies to look at but hey, are two of them lesbians? i guess, there's a picture on the bedside table of one young lady's bedroom and what self-respecting horror movie wouldn't be complete these days without a lesbian couple? yeah whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie try "desecration", "dead waters", or "the convent" (and that's the one with adrienne barbeau, by the way, not the one with john malkovich).

the headline describes it exactly. this dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical 'group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting/killing them off 20 years later' crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades. the only twist is instead of an angry ex-classmate or lovable psycho/loser, it was a nun. nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls, blah blah, girls accidentally/purposely drown the nun, blah blah, nun haunts the girls, people die, movie ends. the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes, which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat lady's arms) but even they couldn't make this a great movie. brian yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse. i'm sure glad i rented it and didn't buy it, or i'd be furious beyond belief. if you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses, go watch demonia or something. stay away from this garbage.

review: nunsploitation films. they've been around since forever. a few that pop to mind are the mexican devil worshiping movie alucarda, night of the demons 2, the convent and of course dante tomasellis desecration. cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. if done right, it works. here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled the nun.the story is about this group of girls that live in a catholic school. in this school there's a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. the girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one. fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her.this movie was produced by brian yuznas fantastic factory. you know, the company that makes horror movies in spain. need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out? well heres a small reminder: arachnid, darkness, romasanta: the werewolf hunt, rottweiler. you get the picture. about the only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was stuart gordons dagon. thats it. oh no, wait, i believe they also produced the excellent christian bale vehicle the machinist. but thats it. so when i consciously rented this movie, i knew i wasn't going to watch anything that was mind blowingly good. still, with all that mental preparation i was disappointed.one of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look. the movie has some nice cinematography. it doesn't look like a cheap horror film. the movies special effects were alright, with the nun being able to travel through water. well, that was an image that lended it self for some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch. i dug that scene with the nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water. its not a particularly deadly move, but it made for a cool visual. there's some gore here but not a lot of it. one particular scene involving an elevator death was cool, but sadly the movie hit its peak with that scene. and it was only half way through. after that, nothing really cool happens and the movie deludes into an incredible borefest.the movie just turns into the nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare, she would kill someone and then cut! we get back to the characters talking crap, going through rooms, opening doors, you get the drill. and i just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that. people opening doors and going into rooms. boring! and when the characters do talk its terrible dialog. in one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so thats they way to go to try and kill her. and everyone just says ok! and they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. now, who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted? who the hell knows, but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid.and yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used spanish actors who have a very thick accent. when they try to speak english its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say. id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated. the fact that this dvd has no english subtitles didn't help matters either.so in conclusion, this is a movie that has some slick visuals, nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. i guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with, then you've still got a bad movie. such was the case with the nun.if you want to have some real fun with evil nuns, rent any of the films i mentioned at the beginning of this review. now, as for the makers of this film, they should go say ten hail maries and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film.rating: 2 out of 5.

six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.yea, basically that's the short of it. there's more to it than that, but i still have no clue what it is. the only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as i was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. i'm also confused as to whether or not it's in english. most of the actors are italian, and even the title here is in italian, yet they spoke english in the film (i think, or it might've been dubbed, i still can't tell).anyway, the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic, and the ending not only doesn't make sense, it...well...doesn't make sense.

i thought this movie'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher. well i was totally wrong. there's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd. i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but i didn't expect to see a fake hollywood film. they certainly faked it pretty well though. why'd they make a movie without any new aspects? this is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination.i thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie'd be something really original. it turned out to be a teen slasher. if this'd been done ten years ago then it'd have been something new.i can't recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value! it's like a horror parody in some points.

the major flaw in this spanish slasher/shocker is within it's script. for the first half hour it's an okay effort, building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread. we even get some nice killings too! then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clichés". i must admit that i was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. the final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent. it should have been so much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay)!first of all, we have the dialog. it's awful most of the time (there was quite a few giggles in the audience here and there when i saw it) and merely adequate elsewhere. it is also barely audible during a lot of scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to!). there is one line in the whole movie that makes a reference to the "i know what you did last summer"-movies, indicating that the film makers wrote it all as one big joke, but i doubt it.and the ending...well, some will hate it, others will dig it. for me, it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes from out of nowhere! if the audience had been given some clues to the girls mental status, i might have thought otherwise. it also throws all logic out of the window, because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills! but as an avid horror fan i have learned to live with these inconsistencies in spanish and italian movies.but all is not bad. the movie has a big budget appearance, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes from past times really shines here), tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. even though most of the actors are pretty bad, anita briem is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with. real screen presence!and, like i mentioned before, the killings are gory enough for the fans of such stuff and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water (but the "water theme" tends to get tiresome in the end though).so, to end this review, it's a movie that is quite fun in a "so-bad-it's-good" kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye. but don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will, judging from trailer and plot descriptions.

i'm no jane austen purist but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say.billie piper was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin-wrong personality,modern make-up,completely wrong hair (there is no way a young lady of her age would have romped around in public with her hair loose and unbrushed like that),she didn't seem particularly meek nor put-upon by the family and i didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind.the picnic(substituted for the ball) was so low-budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the portsmouth section completely destroyed the point of the piece (as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty counterpoint to that oh-so-claustrophobic pink sitting room.)to those responsible:-if you haven't the imagination (even the budget doesn't matter so much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be producing jane austen.it was about 10% mansfield park and 90% nothing much at allps edmund was very good

oh dear! the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. i agree this novel of jane austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a elizabeth bennet, even edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. the basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. if some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) the cast was generally adequate, but i think billie piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. i see i must wait for the bbc to weave its magic once again.

well, this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. and, as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there, the character of fanny price is no where to be found. instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character. at least in the 1999 movie the character they call "fanny price" is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good. this "fanny price" is a complete enigma. someday, i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen. a sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution. she is reserved in manner and painfully honest, but also strong in her convictions, unfailingly loyal, extremely intelligent, and remarkably astute. a bit of a late bloomer, it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self-possessed young woman. and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most. it's a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed.

i doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read mansfield park...or if they have it was not very well. none of the characters are what they should be: fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while sir thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into aunt norris' personality. additionally, a first person narrative by fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and i would contend that she is not meant to be. additionally, in the movie version, fanny flirts shamelessly with edmund from the very beginning, when they have been raised as brother and sister! austen's fanny would have shrank from flirtation of any sort, and the novel paints the fanny/edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable...as it should be. unlike some other jane austen novels (p&p, emma), mansfield park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist. it is a very different sort of novel than the others; it is not meant to be a love story. i watched this movie because i have just now finished reading mansfield park, and i am absolutely horrified by what i see; miss austen is rolling in her grave.

i watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and i returned to some light reading "lobotomy for beginners".it was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.it was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. there were throw-away references to lord nelson and slavery but edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by blake ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century. the other bright-young things had make-up and costumes more appropriate to a 21st century fancy dress party - the bleached-blonde fanny, billie piper being the least credible character.uk commercial television obviously believes heaving bosoms, pouting lips and deep meaningful looks make a good story. fortunately jane austen had other ideas.if you want to find out the story of mansfield park, buy the 1983 mini-series dvd.

i know it sounds crazy but yes, i am a huge fan of house party 1 and 2 (and proud of it!!). i hated part 3, and then here comes part 4. i was like are you kidding me with this? kid 'n play are nowhere to be found in this movie, and that would've been okay, had they not foolishly entitled the movie house party 4, as if it was in any way, shape, form, or fashion related to its predecessors. every time this movie comes on late at night on usa, i shoot my tv with a rifle. quite frankly, it really is just that atrocious. *hurling*as the only remaining fan of kid 'n play that will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee), i was appalled. remember that stupid little boy group immature? they snuck their way into house party 3. okay, fine and well but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they're not even the same kids from part 3. *confused!!!!* house party fans: do yourself a favor and stick to house party 1 and 2 and class act. beyond that, everything else is ridiculous.

sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch, but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind. house party 4: down to the last minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off. this final installment to the house party series is by far the worst, not just sequel, but film released by hollywood. it becomes very apparent early on in this "feature" that director chris stokes loved ferris bueller's day off with a passion. i say this because it becomes very clear that stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of bueller off john hughes' hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor. you would think that by "stealing" themes and images from a funnier film, your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two. with house party 4, stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, much less a hollywood film. from his confusing and choppy story, the inability to make sense of his characters, and recycled old/tired cliché moments, all stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the house party films. it reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum, and straws and presents it as "hannibal crossing the alps". it just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.so, where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? honestly, i do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long, so instead i would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest. to begin, i still cannot shake the ferris beuller rip-off. it was as if director stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to house party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula. that was a huge mistake. when a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. we think that we are going in one direction, but instead we head in another one. that is exactly what you can witness in house party 4. in one instance we have john-john trying to have the "biggest party of the decade" while also trying to score a record deal (ok, kinda reminds me of the original house party), but then we whisk away to this random island where uncle charles is afraid of flying, grandma gets drunk, and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer. again, we begin somewhat strong, and end chaotic. this is the confusion in which i speak. director stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. he would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series. one would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another house party film he would walk into it thinking that he/she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life, instead stokes just wanted to get paid.i realize that i am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by, but i do believe i still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture. i listened to rap and r&b growing up, but the group "immature" never made it to either my cassette deck or my cd player. why? i don't think they ever quite had a following, but apparently to director chris stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new house party film. didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly? or how about the option to have stokes himself play the comedic car repairman, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor. it was one of those few instances when i actually missed robin harris, and i never thought i would find myself saying that to any film. outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role, i also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film. uncle charles was annoying when he attempted humor. kim whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while  well  everyone else pretty much falls into that category.where did chris stokes spend most of the budget for this film? not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some, there were definitely none present at the "unforgettable" house party, nor the possible dream that perhaps kid or play would make one final appearance. house party 4 followed no preset design, which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down. can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the "escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver" routine for humor? stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance. for once i can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film. house party 4 buried the series, and while i do hear that there may be more in the pipeline, i only hope hollywood realizes that this series has died. hollywood needs to let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future. i think a sequel to who's the man? would get them started in the right direction.grade: * out of *****

a long time ago, way back in the early '80s, a late-night tv show "fridays" came to abc, trying to steal the limelight away from nbc's badly-listing "saturday night live". it didn't but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented "comedians" to the world. like mark blankenfield, for example.which, in a roundabout way, brings us to "jekyll and hyde... together again". which is repugnant in ways all its own.blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after communion. and about as tasteful, too. this is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated "fridays" show stretched out to feature length. and if you didn't like him there, why are you reading this review?any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, that's a bad sign. then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out, things can only get worse.a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story? about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of poe's "fall of the house of usher".aside from a few (very few) gags that give a slight grin, this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities.no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave. what more observant a review could they give themselves?no stars. no, not even for armstrong, who should have known better. "hyde" from this one.

i did not quite get barnens o  it is one of the weirdest ones i have watched. the soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by jean michel jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me, or boring  or confusing. there are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up . probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be "when you are alone, you can control things " and "i will show them "- or something like that .the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  "the last summer as a child "he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max. so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you won't miss much if you don't.

i didn't really care for this. had they gotten rid of the comedy/slapstick and focused on the dramatic/philosophical aspects of the script, this might have been worthwhile.the more the film went on, the less i liked the protagonist/mailman. he does have interesting things to say, but he's also a hypocritical, insecure jerk.3/10

i don't know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say, but they badly failed at whatever it was. unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer. i watched this movie simply because drew barrymore was in it, and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it. the whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is utterly ridiculous.

i'm not going to say too much as this movie isn't worth the effort. to put it simply the movie absolutely sucked! this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the storyline was stupid, you couldn't follow what was happening, the characters were so annoying especially the main guy. i wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of it's misery.very, very bad.

some movies are off-beat, but enjoyable, but many movies are just mind-numbingly weird. "motorama" fits not-so-nicely in the latter category. many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense, but those two things can only take a movie so far, and "motorama" simply doesn't have any other merits to its credit."motorama" delights itself on plot improbabilities. its main character, gus, is a cussing 10-year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win $500 million. when interacting with adult figures, none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that he's 10 years old. at first it's incredibly funny, but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable, especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing (to someone that age) imagery going on around him. gus has no depth, and, as an anti-hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces, it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble.that trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances, each mistreating gus in more and more strange ways. besides making the already worn-out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable, the characters share gus' lack of depth and are equally unmemorable. the character's actions can get a little interesting, but the actors themselves don't add anything to them, thus negating the whole point of getting big names (they could've been played by anyone and the character would've been the same). these guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything else."motorama" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but there's too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work. incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer don't, as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident, in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for gus. that never happens, as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect, it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt, one incident after another. with a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable, and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level, "motorama" has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich. why should we care about that?

even die hard john wayne fans will have to concede that this film is a mess. wayne's character, john tobin is after the gang that killed his parents, led by half apache, half white renegade pandro zanti (earl dwire), posing as a mexican. there are almost too many silly plot points to count, but those that stand out include sheriff williams (jack rockwell) cuffing a captured zanti around his boot, so all zanti has to do to get free is remove his boot! tobin's friend dusty (george pre-gabby hayes) takes a thrown knife in the back, and comes back good as new for the rest of the story. in a chase scene, tobin rides a makeshift log flume through a drainage trough surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and missing his mark, chases (actually walks after) zanti on foot through the desert. zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but oops!, he didn't see the sign above the waterhole that states "don't drink poison". as zanti collapses dead, tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang, and captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage into dusty's cabin - how convenient.in the closing scene, the new sheriff tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new mrs. tobin (sheila terry), dusty's daughter ruby, who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of zanti's gang. apparently, the studio was intent on wayne's getting the girl in virtually every film they made with him, as this type of ending is completely predictable for almost all of lone star's films.

what a silly movie. while it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. on the one hand, the film suggests that juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. on the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like miss havesham in a castle. this movie is what elizabeth would have been if elizabeth had not been able to get past essex's sexual attraction.

vicente aranda has made a terrible historical movie. it shows the poor resources of the spanish cinema. in the movie, an irreal script shows juana just as a ninphomaniac, faced to felipe, worried only for sex...but sex with others not with her. the technical mistakes begin with the wedding ring that shows isabel of castilla -nobody noticed that?-. then, the voice in off seems as a documentary, actors and actress in the movie sometimes laughs -take a look to the sequence when juana arrives to the council which want to keep her isolated-; the castles are almost broken when in the age of the movie they have been recently built, crowds are just "four" people, lights are bad placed...compared with amelie poulain, the french movie for the oscars...it has no sense to speak about a bad movie like juana la loca.

this film is a great disappointment. director vicente aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril. in juana la loca, he relies on a gifted actress as well , newcomer pilar lopez de ayala, but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie. while lopez de ayala tries hard to portray juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband, it seems as if she weren't able to develop her character over this one-dimensional feature; juana was an important figure in spanish history, and politics of that time were essential in her storyline... but here she's introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera; this is a real pity, and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa. worst of all, italian actors daniele liotti and manuela arcuri turn out in real bad performances, which, in the case of liotti is a real problem as he portrays felipe el hermoso, a pivotal role in this story. it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences, as both of them look like top-models of this era. on the other hand, talented actors such as giuliano gemma and rosana pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped. even if this was a big-budgeted film, little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating "period pieces" on the screen. costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material,without regarding of a real coherence. all in all, the main problem with juana la loca (and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth) is the lack of a director's point of view. this a strange turn in aranda's career, as he was able to develop it in other works (libertarias and amantes come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting movies, while this juana really is no more than a routine academic historical piece... and a not very good one at that!

allegedly the "true story" of juana de castilla, the eldest daughter of the catholic queen isabella (yes, the same who funded columbus's expedition), the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the archduke philip of austria, known as "the handsome" (and played in a rather unispired manner by italian hunk daniele liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). this is a groan-inducingly familiar story of late 15th c., early 16th c. intrigue, betrayal and bodice-ripping. it drips destructive lust from start to finish. but while la reine margot succeeds in making cruel sensuality and ruthless, cut-throat intrigue entertaining to watch, juana la loca just doesn't pull off. it just ends up feeling like a big-budgeted soap opera, with below-average, lazy or over-keen acting. liotti looks positively bored and pilar lópez de ayala in the title role  though to be fair she may mature into a proper talent  just seems to be trying too hard, switching back and fourth from two-dimensional horny-looking to spoilt teenage hysterics all the way through. some of the supporting cast are ok, with the exception of manuela arcuri, another italian pin-up, voluptuous and beautiful but really no "actress" to speak of. i couldn't in fact bring myself to feel any concern towards any character, nor for that matter did i feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains. what a waste of a substantial film budget! this one, sadly, is just so rhetorical and deja-vu, nodding to other films in the genre rather than to its source material - history - for inspiration. it seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior film-maker to evoke it.

this oddity contains bunuel-like touches, but doesn't sustain one's interest. a 10 year old roams a bizarro america in a stolen mustang, while the usual cult movie suspects (dick miller, mary woronov, susie tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. like his after hours and vampire's kiss, the screenwriter delights in making you squirm. i remained unaffected, due to the broad acting. you know you're in for it when meat loaf and flea give the most appealing perfs. (and what did this kid's screen test look like? he's insufferable.) recommended to the dozen or so fans of sonny boy ('87).

ok,i've seen over 100 troma films, and some of them are pretty bad. "sizzle beach u.s.a." was horrible, and "i was a teenage tv terrorist" was unwatchable, but this is the worst film in the troma library!a bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape.this is really terrible. even as exploitation films go. doris wishman and hershall gordon lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film. avoid this movie at all costs.

"escape from hell" is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is: crass exploitation. the direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera-work during the fight between cintia lodetti and ajita wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening; also, if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the "fake plague" plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it. i would have given this film a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and christina lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body), but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points. of course some sickos will take that as a recommendation. after all, one thing even more disturbing than this film is that some people actually gave it positive reviews!

have you ever wondered why these guys -- seagal, stallone, willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? i think i've got it figured out. the enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.here, seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. one of the heavies has a shotgun. or maybe two of them have. it doesn't really matter. there could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.and when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it. the evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is, brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows. not only is he a master of these outré skills but his physical strength is herculean. more than once he snaps somebody's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick. one he breaks a guy's spine over his knee.i'll tell you something. (i'm getting into the spirit of the film here because seagal uses that line, "i'll tell you something," several times, along with, "what's that supposed to mean?") these guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good xenophobe's handbook. they are all black, speak with unintelligible jah-may-can accents, wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo, they torture and murder with aplomb, and -- here's the worst part. they're unchristian. that's right. they practice voodoo.actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film. they got the constituents of the ritual pretty well -- cigar smoke, rum spitting, the sacrificial chicken. they only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer. they should have read metraux on voodoo.otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions. what was done to jaqueline bissett by the voodoo-practitioners in "the deep" is done here to a friend of seagal's. what was done to john wayne when he was stuck between trucks in "mcq" is done here to seagal himself. at the movie's very opening, when seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his dea career so he's now happily retired, and when we are introduced to his friends and family, i tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if i could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge.the acting doesn't really require much comment. but charles, the jamaican cop, played by tom wright, is really pretty good. wright has considerable range. here, he's an associate of dubious allegiance, rather sinister. but in "the pentagon wars" he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly.the jamaicans never flew as movie villains. i don't know why exactly. it's a small movie market. and if you go to jamaica stick to montego bay. however, if you want to see jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies, and if you're in the mood for another typical-standard action flick, this should be a satisfying view.

so seagal plays a dea detective named john hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into, surprise surprise, colombia! not to brag or anything, but my father was born and raised in colombia (hence my last name), and now he's a doctor in california, so no matter what the movies would have you believe, there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of colombia!at any rate, in a drug bust gone bad, hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked colombian prostitute, inspiring him to go to confession, somewhere that i have never seen him go before in any of his movies, before or since. it was actually pretty interesting. seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt, whether by a stripper or by a lover, never piques the slightest bit of interest from him. he's all get-the- bad-guys all the time. but in the confession booth, he confesses to having lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence, and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars (i hope i'm not getting in trouble with god by telling you this). the priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to retire from the force. the next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper-thin characterization characteristic of seagal's films. marked for death is the story of seagal against a band of mystic jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylight.hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach, max (a minimal effort by keith david), and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread-locked crackheads sitting right there in the bleachers peddling crack to some bookworm-looking high school girls.maybe i just had a sheltered experience in high school, but i didn't know crack dealers and crackheads hung out at school in the middle of the day. at any rate, it's not long before hatcher learns how evil these guys are. they're not just peddling crack to high school kids, but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs, they engage in smartass stare-downs with max, and since that's not enough, his 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse.ah, ok. we get the picture. i'm sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women, and maybe steal candy from children too, just for good measure. is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are? 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse. wow.anyway. not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie name-calling, where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue, but they also don't know how they should act. the leader of the drug dealers, is named screwface, and i suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is. screwface is a cartoonish jamaican man with these bright, bizarrely green eyes, which i am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head. his favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever he's yelling at. this guy likes to get so into guys' faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses don't touch. all i could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath.man, they do not want you to forget that these guys are jamaican, by the way. their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie it's nearly impossible to understand them. not that it matters. it doesn't matter what they're saying, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug-related thing, they're just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people. the movie must have been a huge hit in jamaica!my biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics, particularly of the bad guys, as i've described, are spectacularly goofy, even for a seagal film. they are so cartoonish and weird that it's impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball b-movie creation, something slapped together to provide fodder to whom seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smack-down retribution. but there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird. for example, a mystic, i guess you would call her, at one point puts some kind of curse on screwface by (if i remember correctly) spitting mouthfuls of bacardi onto a live rooster that's hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of screwface. hmm. interesting. sadly, it's this same woman that warns hatcher that his family has been "marked for death" by these people, meaning they've got some voodoo hex on them. not to belittle anyone, but if i was told that my family had been cursed by people like that, i would just laugh at it. hatcher doesn't strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses! but the set-up, as you can see, is pretty standard for a seagal film. unique villains, i guess you could say, although not very impressive. definitely the weirdest film of seagal's early career

marked for death (1990) spends more time on action sequences, than it does with focusing on its characters. after his first two impressive efforts, above the law (1988) and hard to kill (1989), this third steven seagal picture makes the idea clear: anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool; the bad guys are just there to make him look good.seagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick-'em-up antics of chuck norris or jean claude van damme.in marked for death, seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation. this film contains loads of graphic violence, gore and nudity that seem to be there for no reason other than to please rowdy moviegoers, who are unable to distinguish between action pictures that tell a story and those that simply pour on the thrills without rhyme or reason. and he deserves some real blame for this lapse in taste as a producer of "marked for death."seagal plays john hatcher, a retired dea agent who comes home to chicago, where his family is being attacked by a jamaican street gang, who attack his sister's house, and the film proves that it isn't squeamish when hatcher's niece (danielle harris) is shot in the crossfire. hatcher gets mad, and he decides to team up with his old friend, max (keith david), a school gym teacher, and charles (tom wright), a jamaican cop.naturally, hatcher declares war on the chief bad guy, a dread-locked jamaican voodoo priest called screwface (basil wallace), a nickname that apparently means "outrageous overacting." and it is almost unbelievable in the way seagal picks off various members of the gang: he gouges one guy's eyeball, he breaks a guy's back, and he breaks numerous arms and limbs.all logic for this movie is thrown out the window- -through the glass, that is. why aren't hatcher and friends indicted for all the property damage they cause or the body count that piles up? and how did they get their cache of automatic weapons from illinois to jamaica by plane without being detected? seagal has a clint eastwood stoicism about him that fans once seemed to enjoy, and despite the three different characters he's played in as many films, each dresses in oriental black bathrobes, and wears a ponytail. one of the problems that i have with some of seagal's movies is that the main characters never seem to be in serious jeopardy, and because he's the star, of course, no one can lay a glove on him, except for the bad guy.seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most of the plot lines and action sequences. regardless of whether he's masquerading as a ship's cook, a fire fighter, or an l.a. cop wearing love beads, seagal is always seagal, which is exactly what his fans want. in fact, the sameness of these films is such that, if i wanted to, i could take an old review, change the names, and have a reasonably accurate take on the new movie. not that i'd ever really do that...

just finished watching this movie as it were playing on tv and i did'nt have anything else to do. went right here to imdb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments. and what do i find? every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky! i would'nt even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suck-ass movie i thought that i could.the acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast. the worst one was the guy playing brian wilson (think i got the name right) as he were overacting, especially when he was high. the rest was'nt as bad as him but no one was good neither. i ain't no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much.... except it sucked though. no motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life to. and what i found worst was that i thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys, but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters. i hate when they do that in movies, same thing in the doors, even though i like that movie more. don't have any energy left to write more... it sucked! don't buy or watch it!

i love the beach boys and their music. so, being that i am a filmmaker, i thought, wow, a beach boys movie sounds great. well, wrong! i just actually turned off hdnet, the channel the movie was playing on, because it was so bad. someone above mentioned about editing... well, they should have at least looked at the monitors while they were filming. i don't know if anyone else caught the mustache falling off the face of one of the guys after he kissed his wife and then he smoothed it back on with his hands. ever heard of re-taking a scene! acting was terrible. direction was terrible. make-up was terrible!!! possibly the worst make-up job i have ever seen. brian wilson's "fat" cheek's looked like pl-ado. this is honestly the first time i have ever commented on imdb, and i know it really doesn't make a difference... but come on, what the hell were the producers thinking?!?!!?

another movie that makes the story of the beach boys worse than it is. i especially remember the scene when brian says he's to quit touring and the other boys calls him traitor. i didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. a movie about the beach boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. the sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group. hard-core fans like myself knew that this isn't the entire true story and that's why i gave it a low rating 3. however it is the best movie about the beach boys i've seen so far, that says quite a bit about the other movies. if you want the truth i recommend the documentary endless harmony.

while not truly terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of beach boys history.basically, this movie would have you believe that mike love was the brains behind the band and brian wilson was just a pathetic psycho. in fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a tv movie so what do you expect? mike love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re-write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius. yeah, as if...on the plus side, the music is excellent. unlike the previous beach boys made-for-tv bio-pic "summer dreams", this movie actually features real beach boys music, rather than anemic cover versions...also, it features a surprising number of beach boys-related rarities and seldom-heard tracks - the sunrays "i live for the sun" being but one example.this movie was originally shown in two parts on american network tv. part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys early days and rise to the top. by the time part two rolls around, the brian wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs - but how could anyone take this crap seriously? if you're not a beach boys fan you probably won't get much out of this movie except an extremely warped and one-sided view of the band's history. but then again, why would you watch this if you weren't a fan?

you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic. these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine, walk around in a daze, looking like they'd rather be any place, but there.the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic. in these days of political correctness, a film about american pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now. it should have been better done back then.kirk douglas is a former united states senator who's heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in oregon's willamette valley. being he's an ex-politician, he rates above the hoi ploi he's leading. the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon, but a carriage to lead the train.you think that's ludicrous, you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant, played by roy glenn to whip him. i won't spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn, but trust me, it's bad.robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored. there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas, but mitchum just saunters through the film above it all.maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas, a widower, to have an eye on mrs. widmark, played by lola albright. now she's the best looking thing in the movie.the film billing says introducing sally field. this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days. she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy mcbee. we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon, legs akimbo and inviting. of course she gets taken up on her invitation.her character is something like what's found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train, but one large trailer park on the move. despite this film, sally field went on to a two oscar career. what that woman had to overcome.victor mclaglen's son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess. shame on andrew mclaglen, he's certainly done better in his career.and so will you, unless you're a stargazer.

a 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across america to find motorama cards, which is a gas station card game, that if he can find to spell out "motorama" he has a chance to win 500 million dollars. he meets many bizarre characters along the way. no one can make an 'instant cult classic', joe minion's previous "after hours" achieved that by sheer merit & an amazing director, but it wasn't instant. this movie, on the other hand, is just bizarre just to be bizarre. no rhyme or reason to any of it. the plot is incidental at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos. it's just not a fun film nor a thoughtful one. it's way too slapped together. i've heard many comparisons between this and david lynch films. that's damn near heresy as even lynch's 'worst' film (worst in quotes, as he doesn't have an bad films really) is still miles above this dreck. eye candy: cynthia king is topless very briefly dvd extras: trailer for "joe dirt'

the only reason i checked this film out was to see the "early" kim bassinger. that, and the fact that my tv guide said it was a "gripping suspense", and it was three-star rated. the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether i would finish it or not. robert culp turns in what has to be the "disaster" of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable. at one point, everybody is a suspect, including a frail old woman. if you want to deliberately set out to watch a badly written, badly directed, badly acted movie...then go for it. it may make you appreciate fine films by comparison. i wish i had that hour and thirty six minutes back.

***spoilers*** this movie - called eaten alive here in the uk is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. a sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the new guinea jungle. what follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed. the cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing. the cast are awful except for janet agren as the female lead who is excellent. look out for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered with gold paint! my rating - 1 out of 10.

uuuuaaa! barf! yuk! yuk! disgusting! puke city! worst piece of junk ever made. sick. weird. horrible. enough said. hold your nose. don't eat. after seeing this sick, demented, garbage pail of a movie, you won't be able to eat your food for a week. but, maybe that's good. a new diet has been invented. go to see this vomit inducing film. get sick to your stomach. and you will be so turned off by the whole mess, that you can't eat for at least a week, and you drop about 15 pounds.me me lay! with a name like this, it's really amazing that she doesn't have a "cult" fan following. she rates as the worst actress ever. her films make ed woods look like gone with the wind. this movie rates a minus 10.

i recently viewed a copy of this (under the title 'eaten alive') talk about dreadful! any movie ed wood ever put out looks like oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. to be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as "these people (cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me" classic! the mad 'jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really did look like a nutter. i think he was the only actor not to be dubbed in (badly), if these italians must have american characters in their films why dont they get americans to dub in the dialogue instead of english people trying their best to sound like annie oakley. i'll give this 3 out of 10, i'll give it three because it really is funnier than most comedies out these days.

why is it that in the '50s and '60s, italians made so of the best movies, and then during the '70s and '80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? probably because art films didn't make any money. , the cannibal movie, unlike the zombie movie, which was created by americans and `exploited' by italians, is a purely italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). eaten alive came during the cannibal movie heyday. the director, umberto lenzi, hadn't even hit his stride yet; his genre classic, cannibal ferox, was still a year away.in plotting similar to (read: ripped off from) ruggero deodato's seminal cannibal classic, cannibal holocaust, a woman (janet agren) receives word from the police that they've received a 8mm film from her sister. she's gone missing in africa, and it's suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it. mel ferrer, as a professor of somethingoranother, tells her that a man named jonas (ivan rassimov) has started a jonestown-like cult in new guinea, and that's where the sister is. the woman hires a guide (robert kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. and, wouldn't you know it, the jungle is full of cannibals. one sentence should sum it up: if you've seen on cannibal movie, you've seen them all, mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other (lenzi copied cannibal holocaust to make this film, and retooled this to make cannibal ferox; deodato copied parts of this for hit and run). and because they all share the same material, they all feature the same traits: awful photography, boring scenery, terrible dubbing, overacting, and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran. rassimov and kerman have a scenery eating contest. agren exists solely to be naked, raped, or in peril. plenty o' gore for all the sickos out there. the cannibals, who do actually appear to be native cannibals, eat lunch met disguised as human flesh. and, in the grand tradition of cannibal movies, any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter. overall, really not a good experience, but i'm sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining. i know i did.

umberto lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash. janet agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. it turns out the sister is part of a jim jones type religous cult in new guinea. she hires a scruffy guide played by robert kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. this is another (!) cannibal movie, and i probably would have liked it if not for lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior "the man from deep river." i mean every cannibal scene is directly lifted from this film, which i guess makes him about as credible as al adamson. i felt ripped off. ***spoiler*** 1/2 star and that's for the dildo scene.

this movie contains real animals been killed, like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open. i find this totally deranged and sick, and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash.this movie is so stupid and daft, that it has no logic at all.there is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie, still don't bother viewing this trash for that, if you want to see boobs and sex, watch a porno instead. there is also rape scenes in this movie, which i found disgusting, like women been raped and cut up, and eaten. this movie is for sadists and those who get their kicks, seeing people been cut up and eaten.a lot of the animals, like the monkey that appeared in this movie, there is none in the jungles of new guinea. the local characters, most of them appeared to be asian and none look like they come from new guinea. it looks like, this movie was made around the grounds of a resort, which i bet it was.stay away from this trash, its sick and deranged.

a snore gore. i saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the cameo movie house (now the famous crobar night-club)on washington avenue on south beach in 1980 or 81. i was 17, and my three buddies and i laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash. the theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. they didn't miss a darn thing. the worst acting ever.these actors deserve the academy award for the worst, and i mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema. joke was, the theater was showing another mi mi lay(a great name at least!) stinker...barf city. enough said. if you're under 12 years old you might get a few chills. over 12, you will be snoring after the opening credits. it's just amazing that anyone spent a cent on making this movie. and to think, it's considered a "cult" classic. yuk!!!!

"eaten alive" goes down much easier than ruggero deodato's "cannibal holocaust," but it's also a far more sillier film. i mean, at times it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so mind-numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end. tough guy robert kerman (cannibal holocaust) teams up with janet agren (the gates of hell; here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungles of new guinea for agren's sister, who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (ivan rassimov). along the way, they fall witness to (sometimes real) animal torture and some cheesily rendered cannibalism. as directed by umberto lenzi, the movie is so over-the-top it's hard to take seriously, but if you enjoy trash cinema with more than a few unintentional laughs, it's not bad.4/10

eaten alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's cannibal ferox. the characters are universally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there's no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a pg-13. even the scenes of animal 'cruelty' are more tedious than usual. the only mildly shocking scene involves crazy jonas, going a bit goldfinger, wielding a blood soaked dildo; a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic. my beloved wife, she of the 'romeo and juliet collector's edition', watched this movie without so much as a wince of disgust! and it calls itself a cannibal movie! all-in-all, a pretty lame effort that thoroughly betrays the cannibal tradition. cannibal ferox, luci's follow-up, is a far superior example of the genre.

sigh. i'm baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak tim burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. and we got the "joke" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright?but i guess what's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called lenore, the cute little dead girl by roman dirge! as any quick internet search will reveal. i mean, what is this? this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker? "give your head a shake" as don cherry might say.

largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman & employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agren's missing sister.despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardona's "guyana - crime of the century". lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion. with sister in toe, kerman & agren attempt to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing into the "green inferno", only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites.one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighties, where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures. this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others, but with much less success.was it the so called "amazonian natives" who looked like they were bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in sri lanka), or the inept "decapitation" and "castration" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in "cannibal holocaust"? you can decide. without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose ends are resolved. most unsatisfying.as with the others, where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully), the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk, that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.if there are any redeemable features at all, kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man, and his bevy of scantily clad co-stars (agren, lai and senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings.

i love umberto lenzi's cop movies -- rome armed to the teeth is my favorite -- and his desert commandos pretty much legitimized the italian euro war phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie. give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss.what a shame it is then to encounter his eaten alive and cannibal ferox. they could have been by anybody, really, and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract, was told what kind of films to make, was assigned a cast & crew and given a budget, deadline and script. lenzi then went out and executed his films the same way that a guy at mcdonald's fixes a batch of french fries. of the two, eaten alive is the more original -- which is kind of amazing considering that it features extensive footage copped from three other cannibal movies -- and easier to enjoy than cannibal ferox, though not much.i will let others outline the plot: what fascinated me about the film is how staged it all looks, and yet what a somewhat infamous reputation this film has as some sort of all-out assault on good taste. it isn't, though the film is an exercise in bad taste, complete with a title-earning scene where two of the pretty supporting ladies are quite literally sliced up and eaten alive by cannibals which is the film's high point. the problem is that lenzi lets us get a good, long look at the cannibal feast scene and it has the convincing ring of a 3rd season star trek episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots. and i don't know about anyone else, but if someone was slicing off pieces of my person and eating them i wouldn't just lie there and look distressed.my problem with the film might be that i have a lot of respect for lenzi as a filmmaker, and again this could have been directed by anybody. all of your cannibal movie conventions are touched on but it never feels like they are filmed with any real conviction, other than to try and bully ruggero deodato out of the sandbox. the two directors certainly must have known each other and either had a sort of juvenile rivalry or an actual dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to upstage them. lenzi invented the cannibal genre with man from deep river, deodato blew it away with jungle holocaust, lenzi fired back with eaten alive, deodato blew him (and everyone else) away with the superior cannibal holocaust, and lenzi fired a last parting salvo with cannibal ferox, which is about as realistic as that krazy glu commercial where the guy superglues his hardhat to a girder and hangs in midair.this film is less desperate and a bit more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss with everything holy than ferox, which remains as a sort of misguided attempt to upstage cannibal holocaust. this one is more of a mish-mash, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a jim jones like suicide cult -- the cannibals seem like they were added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the film. i think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of lenzi's films looking for something new by the formidable director. it isn't as entertaining as slave of the cannibal god, adventurous as his own man from deep river and certainly lacks the wallop of cannibal holocaust. combine those considerations with the recycled footage, stomach churning scenes of animal violence, misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and stagy, wooden methodology of film-making and what you get ends up being an ok jungle thriller with two or three standout scenes, and umberto lenzi was capable of so much more.4/10; gore freaks will go nuts however.

an asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in niagara falls and new york city before getting run over by a car. sheila morris (former miss sweden janet agren, given a hilarious "southern belle" dub to show she's from alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister diana (paola senatore) and sets out to investigate. this brings her to new guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (robert kerman i.e. american porn star r. bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. after barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate diana, who's under the control of jim jones-type cult leader jonas melvyn (ivan rassimov). jonas does the typical mad guru-style things, like passing out lsd, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping agren with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from jungle holocaust or man from deep river (both of which were also directed by lenzi). i'm pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from cannibal holocaust as well. here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes (gutting a gator; natives eating live snakes), plus some additional nudity and a castration. me me lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is gang banged by three of her brother in laws on top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. mel ferrer briefly appears as a professor and isn't given much to do.so anyway, with mangiati vivi! you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you're a sleaze hound, by all means watch it. personally, i got bored with it about midway through and just wanted it to end. the original (heavily cut) u.s. release in 1985 was titled the emerald jungle in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting john boorman's emerald forest. it was also called doomed to die and eaten alive by cannibals!

eaten alive is a little film that opens in new york city and the arctic where tribe men shoot snake venom at a few people,then a woman enters the police precinct who's trying to find her sister that has disappeared after 6 months sheila is from alabama,but her accent sucks,she is teamed up with an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to say it a lot throughout the film.they venture through the amazon only to find a community with people and they find the sister,they're confronted by a mad man who has probably seen one too many jim jones preaches.he will bring them to a better place,it could be heaven but no,mark and sheila find out later its actually a suicide cult.why do i call eaten alive a "little film"? ill tell you but when i watched it,i was floored through all the run ins with the cannibals,robert kerman has a different role than his professor in cannibal holocaust.he's a bit annoying,once we meet him at an arm wrestling match that looked like russian roulette we know hes one tough guy.plus the strong misogyny just makes you cringe and it looked like i saw it somewhere,oh the scenes of animals killing each other.but the whole film revolves on those scenes,its like were actually watching a images of nature with parts of a film but after watching this film i realized that most of the films scenes are taken from other cannibal films,even the demise of 2 of the characters,well..most of the film is.that's why i call this a little film,when i did found out that scenes were borrowed i felt like throwing the disc across the room,this isn't a film just a simple montage of sorts .

one imdb reviewer calls eaten alive a passable film for the "cannibal connoisseur." are there such people? i didn't know. but if you are one of them, hey, have a ball. the rest of you might find this tripe a bit hard to swallow (pun intended), even if, like me, you consider yourself a horror film connoisseur. i have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now, although i never got around to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago, and i guess i owe my short-lived interest in these groan-inducing movies, strangely enough, to china's total disregard for copyright laws. you see, i bought a two-disc dvd collection of all of wesley snipes' films for 20 yuan (about $2.75), which turned out to include last cannibal world, mountain of the cannibal god, eaten alive, cannibal holocaust, next, with nicholas cage, and something called voodoo lagoon, along with blade 1-3, in chinese. nice.being a second sequel, i immediately got a sinking feeling when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major american cities, shooting unsuspecting americans with poison darts and then scrambling away at full speed. having run out of ways to keep movie cannibals scary, it seems that now they have made their way to the mainland. later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a "training exercise." lock up your daughters! before long the movie settles into the old missing sister routine, as a young blonde woman named sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister, who looks nothing like her in any way, but she's willing to spend most of the movie naked so i guess that doesn't matter. it seems that, after shooting one of his victims, the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie, not used to big city life, ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van. the brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing sheila's sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior, but other than the film, the guy is a complete mystery. as the piteous police chief laments, "we know nothing about him except that he's dead!" poor guy, he must be getting a headache from all this. i recommend a nap. luckily, sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around tens of thousands of dollars like it's nothing in the search for her sister. perfect for hiring a plucky backwoods guide caricature, since the police are clearly going to be no help.obviously, nothing new is added to this miniscule sub-genre. quite the contrary, cannibalism almost seems like a background to a completely different kind of bad movie, about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements. thickening the plot of that clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add in a cartoonish jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself jonas, who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature, a process they call "purification." personally, i prefer just peeing outside occasionally.one of my favorite parts of the movie is when sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who looks like he took a three-day weekend from the office to appear in this movie. as he pulls out his trusty medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her, "if you don't believe in jonas and purification (through pain), god help you." he then gives her a shot and, when she winces from the tiny pinch, he politely apologizes to her. i sense a true believer in this guy!as far as the gore, there are plenty of nasty sound effects over random shots of animals getting slaughtered and more than enough disgusting footage of women being cut up and eaten alive, so i guess right there the movie lives up to its name. the acting is astonishingly bad, as can be expected, and interestingly enough, the editing is also spectacularly botched but still strangely effective. unfortunately, i think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in utterly insane cults in order to relate to anyone in the movie. there are plenty of outlandish religious ceremonies that take place, which make it more and more difficult to understand why sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society. i'm all for individualism and doing your own thing, but come on. after a while the movie descends even further into your basic, run of the mill escape movie, just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate rendition of glory, glory hallelujah in film history. wow. note: in this movie, a woman is raped with a severed snake. if you need any more reason never to watch it, seek professional help. avoid this mess at all costs.

eaten alive follows a young woman (janet agren) who searches for her lost sister. turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of borneo. with vietnam veteran mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.as per usual, the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl me me lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare, female lead janet agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. now that's gotta count for something! but, i must say that i find it bit hard to recommend this title. if you are fan of the genre, you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a select few. and i mean that literally. a lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other cannibal movies, like man from deep river and last cannibal world. there's probably more movies stuck in there.ultimately, this is one for die-hard fans to check off their list. if you haven't seen any italian jungle movies, you'd be better off watching cannibal holocaust and if you're an avid fan, you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies.

personally, i didn't really gain a whole lot from the act of seeing with one's own eyes. i've noticed a lot of really highly rated reviews on here for the film, and i'm kinda surprised. maybe i missed something that other reviewers felt "moved" by but i found the film pretty tedious and basically pointless.the "action" of the film is a bunch of autopsy footage that is filmed in an "art-house" style - lots of extreme close-ups, weird editing, etc...and with no sound or dialogue.i guess the act of seeing with one's own eyes could be considered a study of human anatomy, or maybe (if you really wanna dig a little) some sort of comment on the fragility of humanity or whatever - but i personally found it to be a bunch of semi-interesting but ultimately dull autopsy footage. if that's your thing, then this will be a winner for you. as for me - i've seen more interesting er footage. not a "bad" film, as it isn't really a "film" in any traditional sense - i just found nothing really notable about it - 4/10.

i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. michael mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of daniel day lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite daniel day lewis films are there will be blood and gangs of new york.there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though. this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random. i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7.8.i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think. i didn't really like it............. 4/10.............j.d seaton

armed and dangerous is not one of the greats of john candy. this film about a fired cop who ends up working for a small security system run by the mob is very weak and not very much a comedy. there are some moments that i did enjoy, like looking at candy in a pilot suit, but it doesn't seem to matter much. armed and dangerous is still a dangerously disappointing dud brought to us by the director of the equally dumb actioner commando. what a sad excuse for a comedy!1 out of 5

john candy and eugene levy star as inept security guards who chase down a big time mobster. inept is truly the right word for this alleged comedy...a few laughs but mostly groans and thoughts to yourself like "why am i watching this c**p?" yes that is meg ryan in this too..which i am sure she doesnt want to be reminded of..a waste of a talented cast..on a scale of one to ten ..0

you may like tim burton's fantasies, but not in a commercial-like show off lasting 8 minutes. it demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace.

it's really too bad that john candy wasted his skills on so many horrible films (delirious, wagons east, who's harry crumb?, etc.. this one has maybe a few chuckles, but it's mostly just really bad one-liners and dumb physical stuff. let's honor this comedian's memory by remembering things like planes, trains & automobiles and uncle buck.

i'm a fan of the old sctv show from the late 70's and early 80's and john candy was a major reason why. he was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious. unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies. time after time i was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the "straight" role instead of the funny guy. "armed and dangerous" rarely tries to use john's comedic abilities, or that of harold ramis, for that matter. it is simply a very predictable cops and robbers type of movie. if you are a john candy or harold ramis fan the movie is watchable, just don't expect to laugh much.

i saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. in fact there was almost zero technical information at all. i didn't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video, but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced, and wasn't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.there were other problems. some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race. yeah, real inspiring. the timing was also hard to follow, because it was semi chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. and they withheld information. you see that kantor has an injury, and you just assume it's from all her training, but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that it's because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard.some parts were very good, though, like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be men-only, and the coverage of a chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first place.off the top of my head, i'm thinking of other chronological documentaries, like supersize me, and grass, where you always know where you are, and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know.in short, it wouldn't have been hard to make a better marathon film, and as it stands i can't recommend this to non-marathoners to educate and motivate them to try one, because i don't think it will have that effect.

as a serious marathoner, i was seriously disappointed in this film. its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathoners. following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners, one senior, one injured runner, and two elites as they prepare for the chicago marathon, the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is, for lack of a better word, boring. while i did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of deena kastor, the brief history of the boston marathon and marathoning in general, let me emphasize: these were brief!! watching some joe runners prepare for a saturday run with their water bottles and talking about how they view the marathon is not inspiring, and the nonstop clichés about achievement and feel-good grinning runners will make you wish the film were about an hour shorter. if you are a first-time marathoner, this film may give you a feeling of "i can do it." for anyone else, run away.

honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. if the film was a little grainy it might have added some "creepiness factor" to what was going on. i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others, are more shocking than in aftermath. all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. this is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. it's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some "gore" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. on the other hand - genesis - cerda's "sequel" to aftermath (now available as a "double feature" released by unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material. although i don't care for aftermath at all, genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...

ok so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever. there is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even any real characters. you see three people in the entire movie (that are alive) and two are just there for very little reason. the main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. that is the entire movie. i love to see very gory movies, especially since in america real gore just isn't very common in modern movies. so yeah the gore effects were pretty cool. but it just isn't really disturbing. why does everyone think it's so disturbing? there are no characters at all, there are just 3 living people and 3 corpses. no one has any personality or back story. you see three corpses being hacked apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with death itself and how this could very well happen (despite the guy losing his job and going to jail very shortly after.) to be disturbing the viewer has to care and to care they have to identify with the victim. for example in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character. here it's just a guy and a corpse. it's as deep as a puddle made from only a single rain drop. they never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie. all it is a guy hacking up a few bodies, then he has sex with a body. now with the sex scene here is an odd thing about it, he makes sure to wear gloves but doesn't use a condom. so he couldn't care less about catching some weird std from having sex with a corpse but as long as his hands don't get messy there is no problem, now that is really logical. i don't really dislike the movie, i liked that it was very gory but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again, no reason to even care, and it just isn't a very compelling movie. i say if you can find it for under 10 dollars then you might as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it.

this movie is not so good as i thought it would be. there is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. the gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. it starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. the music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. they should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. and some more info about the morticians would have made this movie far scarier than it is. don't expect a scary movie but a nice, gory special effects reel.

is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after, um, death. spanish director ignacio cerdà (a soul-mate of his german colleague jörg buttgereit) provides blow-by-blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human entrails and warped minds.welcome to the autopsy room!i don't know which facets of the film, apart of its notorious reputation, may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating.storywise it's fairly simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or, perhaps, assistant pathologist or whoever he is) that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion, right at his workplace. i'm perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one-note plot. i suspect it may be somehow inspired by udo kier's character's quirky demeanor in andy warhol's frankenstein.artistic values of the film are also questionable. it's hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don't squeeze a single word. their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks. there's also not enough room for great camera-work - basically, the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls.authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible, but only a handful of medical/forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here (if anyone cares). honestly, i used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death. now i know that dead bodies are severed, raped and humiliated, intestines are ripped apart, brains are retrieved from the head, stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts, then the body is stitched back and washed - nothing personal. and what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward?shock and disgust factor - it's much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover, to his horror, that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection. this obscure item is barely available, sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended. hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film. they are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see.cerdà is really gifted and stylish director, which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his "trilogy" - preceding 'the awakening', amazing black and white short, and 30-minute 'genesis', visually stunning and moody piece with an off-beat and interesting concept. and i'm pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new, more mainstream oriented, material. and sooner or later 'aftermath' would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his "early" "warm-up" works.but in the meantime, i'm afraid, it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations.

don't worry - no spoilers here, just saying there is a very predictable plot. a couple decide to live in his father's love nest so they can write a book/article/newsletter on his fling with a famous tragic hollywood starlet. this whole production ran kind of like a high school troupe doing an episode of "murder she wrote". the only acting i was sold on was the old fogy's they interviewed for sources in the story. apparently the directors thought the movie was getting too long, so towards the end they stopped pointing their camera to a kind of creepy image of the starlet and brought in plot enhancers to wrap this thing up. don't waste your time - even the tried and true horror/intrigue classics fail in this movie.

the 70s were without a doubt the golden age of "made-for-tv" horror. this is one of those that was probably churned out as an abc movie of the week. it's the old story of a house and/or ghost possessing one of the new owners. the movie has promise, but it's never realized. everything is rushed too much. tension and suspense need time to build and grow. and there's nothing new. we've seen it all before and one better.one final thought: i don't understand why robert wagner's character would fall for the long dead movie star when he's married to kate jackson for goodness sake!!!

sigh. i'm baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak tim burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. and we got the "joke" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright?but i guess what's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called lenore, the cute little dead girl by roman dirge! as any quick internet search will reveal. i mean, what is this? this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker? "give your head a shake" as don cherry might say.

attractive husband and wife writing team robert wagner (as joel gregory) and kate jackson (as donna gregory) arrive at the spooky mansion of actress "lorna love" (actually, silent film star harold lloyd's house). mr. wagner and ms. jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star's biography. wagner has a personal interest in the project, since his father was once the famed star's lover. mysterious events unfold, and jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde, who is "perfectly preserved" in a crypt on the estate; moreover, the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband, and murdering jackson! this is very much a "night of dark shadows" variation, co-starring genuine "dark shadows" alumni kate jackson, who knows and plays her part well. robert wagner lacks david selby's intensity. sylvia sidney (as mrs. josephs) sidesteps grayson hall. marianna hill is not a match for lara parker (or diana millay). bill macy (as oscar payne) is good in a part that would have been played by john karlen (in a dan curtis production).there are smooth cameos by joan blondell, john carradine, and dorothy lamour. ms. lamour's delivery resembles joan bennett, which begs the question: why didn't producer aaron spelling get more of the original "dark shadows" regulars? director e.w. swackhamer was bridget hanley's husband; he worked with ms. blondell on "here come the brides", and with jackson on "the rookies". "death at love house" has, arguably, a tighter storyline than the "night of dark shadows" film; it differs in the movie star angle; and, in its "father eternal fire" ending, it more closely resembles the tvseries' "laura the phoenix" storyline. **** death at love house (9/3/76) e.w. swackhamer ~ robert wagner, kate jackson, sylvia sidney

the cast of "all that" returns for good humor in the "good burger" a place similar to an old fashioned fast food restaurant. the comedy is terrific, the fun is non-stop, and though cliché, is a passer for kid and family comedy.a movie for all ages, this movie is meant to enjoy, laugh, and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day, as that's what i'd save this movie for, a rainy day. usa aired it today, and since i know that the cast of "all that" is in it, i thought that it might be a bit of a chuckle burner, but in good fun, as keenan thompson and kel mitchell (probably one of the best young duos of that time) were terrific together, the pieces came together, and everything worked out, and it made it into good family fun together with some lazy day work to get off the bad day.may i take your order?

ed (kel mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at good burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger stand, while his buddy dexter (kennan thompson) also works there, but lack ed's single-minded devotion to his job he's there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher mr. wheat (sinbad) and has to raise money to pay the damages. when mondo burger, a mammoth fast-foot chain, opens across the street, it looks like good burger is history, until ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door. however, the monomaniacal manager of mondo burger, kurt (jan schweiterman), is determined to get his hands on the sauce and put good burger out of business. meanwhile, ed and dexter must rescue otis (abe vigoda), the world's oldest fast food employee, from the demented hills asylum, and ed might just find love with monique (shar jackson) if he could take his mind off the burgers long enough to pay attention to her. good burger is a comedy directed for kids, decent story, acting, and overall a pretty harmless kids movie.

this movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers.he also loves his mommy. so, to keep the money coming in, he takes his act to broadway.see! cody powers jarrett blow himself up on his biggest gas container yet! tonight! 7.30pm! however, one day, his mommy dies and jarrett goes berserk. he kidnaps the audience in the theatre and makes them all stand on top of a huge gas cylinder.losing control further, he makes them all scream "made it ma, top of the cylinder!" in unison.the noise is so deafening that it bursts jarrets eardrums, causing him to topple from the cylinder into a vat of acid.this warner bros. movie is not all it's cracked up to be.

the movie uses motifs that could be plagiarized from "wait until dark" (1967), a much better movie by terence young, starring audrey hepburn. "dead silent" is a pale paraphrase. there is nothing new here -- the hidden object in the doll, the bad men wanting it, the bad guy posing as a good guy. the disability, though, has shifted : audrey hepburn couldn't see, the child in ds cannot speak. but both stories hinge on the handicap. where "wait until dark" built up unbearable suspense, "dead silent" lets you guess the outcome, the story being such a stereotype.

the story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other. they proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift, it was almost like, 'i hope she likes it'! there is a killing in the film and catherine mary stewart,(julia kerbridge),"reaper",2000, gets involved with the case because of family ties. julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life. rob lowe, (kevin finney),"view from the top",03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. this is not a bad film, but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about, unless you like a film location in canada and a good looking catherine mary stewart, a native from canada.

"julia kerbridge (catherine mary stewart) is working hard to become a doctor. suddenly, julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece, amanda, after her parents are found murdered. julia has a new neighbor, the mysterious kevin finney (rob lowe). her hectic life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young amanda holds the key to a terrible secret. for she too is now the target of the killers. julia must discover whether kevin is friend or foe, and unlock the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again," according to the dvd sleeve synopsis.this thriller quietly falls apart at the seams, but it is interesting some of the time. stalker sean devine's background telephone scene (outside the police station) and mr. lowe's violin (restaurant) are tensely played. but, early on, it's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene. unfortunately, this is not an intricate plot point; and, there are worse story stumbles afoot. overall "dead silent" is not a bad way to spend some time, if there is nothing better on, or you're into lowe and his co-stars.**** dead silent (1999) roger cardinal ~ catherine mary stewart, rob lowe, arlen aguayo-stewart, larry day

rob lowe must have eaten up the entire budget, but i can't fault him for running with the money. even he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. filming, editing, direction, dialogue, sets, makeup, writing, casting (especially the young girl and imposter child psychiatrist), and the story all were just the worst. i have never seen such a horrible movie. pass this one up for any other rental selection, or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the tv. dead silent should be silenced for all time.

the first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up, to predictable and the worst scenario i've seen. won't and hopefully i din't buy it. also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did, suck even more. all i want to say to the people who make this is: don't do whole episode about space, because they suck. the point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before. gets worse from season to season. i got so disappointed and frustrated watching first 4 episodes of season 6 that i just had to write this. only people who are brain washed can watch this crap. seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time. think that my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do.

people, get a clue! i mean, the writers dont have one, so i would expect you to...this show is such a pale imitation of the '60 show that you can laugh at it! and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects, and is in b&w fer chrissakes! yet the mood and the writing on the old show is miles ahead of this drivel. get hip kids! if 98 degrees or brittany told you to watch it, you would! you know it! just bypass them and tell all your friends you were 'in' with the 'scene' before it became too cool!

o dear god i suffered having to watch this film four times in my sisters house and was it dreadful a story of sex and guns and very cheap unexplained acting unless you are at gunpoint being told to watch this avoid it ja rule just proved he cannot act ving rhames also gave the most dreadful acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this i have seem some dreadful films in my life but this would be in my five worst films ever the music in it wasn't good and the storyline i think was made up by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down wrote ten bullet points and then made it into a film absolutely dreadful

it is difficult to rate a writer/director's first effort. after all, it is one more movie than i have written or directed. james hunter wrote a story that was interesting, but suffered from an uneven flow.after all, the idea that a man (ja rule) has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common, and even falling in love with the daughter (tatyana ali) of the man you killed has been done. doing it again demands something that is original, and originality is lacking in this film.i was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites: tia carrere (trues lies, wayne's world), pam grier (jackie brown), frank langella (dracula, good night and good luck), and ving rhames (rosewood, dawn of the dead). they did not disappoint in their performances, but they had little to work with.direct to video is becoming more and more common, but that doesn't mean it has to be a waste of time. maybe the sophomore effort of hunter will be more enjoyable.

why did i buy this movie on dvd?, well the short answer would be: i really don't know. as for the longer version, it pretty much comes down to the fact that i genuinely like tatyana ali and she plays alicia in this.now does tatyana ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie? i must say that it is one of the better, and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress. i am very much looking forward to see her in action, when better material will be available.this being said, this movie was terrible - and my score is given based on this: 1 star for not being the worst movie i've seen, 1 star for the performance of tatyana ali, and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars, there are worse movies for that.ja rule should stick to rapping, not my favourite rapper to say the least, but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there, i would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.ving rhames: ah man, marcellus wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man. just because michael caine is a fiercely brilliant actor, who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good, you don't have to copy him ving.the rest of the semi big names in the cast: it's ok, there are bills to be paid, and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time.the movie itself. it so massively flawed, it's pretty difficult to know where to start. it's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together, as were the director to say "we need to tell this, and we need to tell that". there is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it. to say the least, the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time.to sum up in one word: reallynotgood

i'm usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" films, but when i saw this one my reaction was "it must be called experimental because it makes no sense." the "action" is static, while at the same time it bounces from one location to another. there aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are. apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior, the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man.

this experimental silent film, made in switzerland by an independent british film company, is chiefly remembered as paul robeson's first film. it's very artistic, with shots often seeming meaningless to the story, which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter-titles. from what i gathered, robeson's wife, adah, is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man called thorne. it doesn't bother the cigar-chomping owner of the bar/hotel where thorne lives (and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid), but an old lady expresses the town's point of view in an inter-title: "if i had my way, we wouldn't allow negroes in here." thorne is also called "nigger lover" by someone in the bar. adah tries a reconciliation with pete (robeson), but eventually leaves him. thorne's wife, astrid, goes off the deep end, brandishes a knife, cuts thorne's arm and cheek, and somehow dies. thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted. as for pete, he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town. so the film is more about racism than anything, but in an up note, the owner tells pete "the sad thing is, they think they're right. that's the way we are." the meaning of the title is a mystery. it may refer to adah being light-skinned (a borderline negro) or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters.

this film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life, especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years.it basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills, and he says wrong things all the time. the plot is hollow and contrived. the main character, james, is lonely, but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored. it is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from. sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial. there is a serious lack of emotions in the film.it is not funny as a comedy either. there are some funny one liners but that is it. it lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood. i don't find "i want someone to eat cheese with" funny.

i quite enjoyed the wrecking crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being urban menace (1999) which i've yet to see). i know it was baaaaad, but the three leads did a pretty decent job, all things considered.this, however, was truly atrocious. ice-t was dreadful, and he's the producer! can't say i've ever heard of silkk the shocker (who apparently never learnt how to spell), but his performance was one of the worst i've ever seen in a movie.miss jones did pretty well in her small role, though she later went on to make some atrocious, racist "jokes" on her radio show after the se asian tsunami (plus other occasions sadly). way to go, girl...no-one else comes out with any credit. strangely, tj storm and ernie hudson (who are both pretty bad here) are far better in the wrecking crew, which was made, along with urban menace, at the same time as corrupt. how that works, i don't know.i'm going to try the ice-t commentary now, to see whether he apologises for the film, or tries to make us think it's a great piece of film-making.

it borrowed scenes from lotr, matrix, star wars, etc. the humor is so dry, contrived, and corny, that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it. exactly what you'd expect from an hk comedy. the average person would enter with an iq of 100 and leave with less than 80. stephen chow is an obvious omission from this movie. the humor would have worked better with stephen. the mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the cantonese original. the graphics are poor compared to its hollywood counterparts. there is overdependence on low quality cg. my biggest complaint is its ending. the origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the "journey to the west" (jw), that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line. despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie nicholas tse starred in--the promise.

first there was tsui hark's zu warriors (2001), which is visually ground-breaking, but much lacking in the acting and writing departments, now this movie, which is visually almost as good as zu (though no longer ground-breaking), but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. it's really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the hk movie industry. i guess you need to understand cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are. it's like some delinquent kids talking in the street, it's that bad. to make it worse, the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids, and can't act even if their life depend on it. i understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in hk, but has hk youths really become so brain-dead that they can't appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acting/writing? if that's the case, it makes me ashamed to be from hk.i wish hk movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like zhang yi-mou or ang lee, and finally make a movie that's both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments. and stop using young singers/idols/heartthrobs as actors because they can't act however many fans they may have in hk!

it's like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to sit through.now let me go on record by saying how much i love chinese fantasy films. from the fun and silly, to those focusing on martial arts, to the more dramatic and romantic typesit's a genre i very much enjoy. films like "a chinese odyssey: pandora's box" and "a chinese odyssey: cinderella" (both of which were written and/or directed by jeffrey lau); "the bride with white hair"; "butterfly & sword"; "green snake"; "a chinese ghost story"; "swordman ii"; "zu: warriors from the magic mountain"; "crouching tiger, hidden dragon"; and others. which is why i was looking forward to "a chinese tall story." one of the film's characters is the "monkey king" (aka sun wukong), an extremely well-known character in chinese mythology, first told in the stories of the "journey to the west," the epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (the story of the monkey king and his disciples is also the focus of the "chinese odyssey" films, amongst many others). other familiar characters that appear in the film are zhu wuneng (the pig character) and sha wujing.so how does it all go wrong? well, let's take an example familiar to western audiences. how about the robin hood mythology? a well known story from ye olden days. let's say that our robin hood film starred wesley snipes as robin hood, and haley joel osment as friar tuck. maid marian is none other than rosie perez. let's give sir robin an uzi as well, because you never know when you might have to waste the sheriff of nottingham. they might need rocket packs also, and while we're at it, give them a tactical nuclear weapon because that sure could come in handy. if you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the robin hood tale, then "a chinese tall story" is the movie for you! as i indicated above, this movie is a jumbled mess. in the first 30 minutes, we are introduced not only to sun wukong, zhu wuneng, and sha wujing, but also to the monk tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a "millennium bug demon" (which shoots laser beams), an underground tree god, a lizard imp tribe, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the lord chancellor tortoise, a sea dragon king, a ever-morphing magic golden staff, a chatterbox imp girl, wormholes in space, and the four heavenly knights. all this wouldn't be too bad--the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements. but i guarantee you the chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film. (helpful advice to the filmmakers: just because your computer effects guys can come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war, does not mean they should).you know your chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and i am not making this upit's a direct quote from the commentary) "i asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock-and-roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android-like thing." is there a story hidden in here somewhere? yes. yes, there is. most of the adventure follows tripitaka (played by nicholas tse"gen-x cops," "time and tide," "my schoolmate the barbarian") and meiyan, the lizard imp girl (played by charlene choi and a computer). choi is the best thing going in this film. you may know her as half of the canto-pop group "twins" and from other films such as "the twins effect" (a fun flick) and "just one look" (a surprisingly good drama/romance/comedy). poor choi, being a lizard imp and all, is hardly recognizable with her warts, snagged out teeth, doughy nose, and hunched back. that is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her, which somehow makes it worse. tse is passable, but all of the supporting actors were abysmal. a couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted.at one point i was debating with myself if "a chinese tall story" was a spoof. i was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very pretty fan bing-bing) got out and lit up a marlboro (!) while talking with tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a spider-man costume (!!). but it is not a spoof. of course there is the typical hong kong silliness, but the movie takes itself seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos) and rousing action and adventure.you might think that you could watch this on a netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything. (oh, but it'll cost you, all right).is there anything good to say? sure. the colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie). and the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard. too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.

i was watching the beginning of this on a friday, mid-day, while working at computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, and cleaning-up some files and answering some communications. got interrupted a couple of times, so had trouble getting all the details straight (although it's hardly a work of hitchcock proportions, where missing a detail can through the whole story off-kilter), and besides it was not exactly an "engrossing" piece of work.so during a commercial, read the only prior comment here (by "mgconlan-1"), and pretty much can agree with its details.not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly "good," but i'd like to catch on tape when run again (rather than seeing it as aired), so i can fast forward as needed and see the parts which i missed this first time.give it a "3*" because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters.

i do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking, by making the same type of clichéd film over and over, where the bad guys (bad girls in this case) win. weak acting and very predictable. nothing original about it. this same movie has been made over and over again- not different from goodbye lover (1989), slow burn (2005), or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending. there are a lot of holes in the movie too. it is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming. or perhaps they ran out of ideas. but do not waste your time with this one. it will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it.

i saw this movie considering this as a normal hollywood movie but then came to know that its a movie made for tv channel.on my dvd cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as a best movie of the year..all the character were simple and decent performances except the brain's character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end.. there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady police officer and main culprit had a lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea.god knows what happens to dave the male lead character..the other critic from mr. brown's movies said that shocking and effective but doesn't quite live up to all the hype... which i saw after watching the movie .for which i was partially aggree...i should have read this first before taking the movie..

all i can say is, this movie is made for the lifetime channel on tv, which means no solid characters, no particular style, weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy, that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn't it?) but the heavily simulated sex, well, that's ok. when watching these films i have to ask myself, when will these types of tv channels and their advertisers ever grow up? i think these companies are actually way behind the times. they really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change. the whole point of many american tv channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized, diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line. i guess it works for them... or at least it has. not sure about the future though. don't bore yourself to death like i did. seek out some real tv movies on hbo, showtime, ifc, starz, etc. any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show.

the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now. it's the old eternal triangle again  small-town connecticut boy dave ford (matt long) has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend, emily darrow (emmanuelle chriqui), on the eve of his departure for law school in new york, thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs, runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later, and gets involved with her romantically again. but director and co-writer matthew cole weiss goes way over the top, framing the whole thing in flashback as dave confesses to murdering emily, her husband and another one of her lovers in front of (here comes the spoiler) a lesbian cop who's also a flame of emily's. weiss overdoes the "flanging" effect by which dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead, cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal. i couldn't help but flash back myself to james m. cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted into hit movies) "the postman always rings twice," "double indemnity" and "mildred pierce." it also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys (the bad girls, actually) triumphant and the decent, if naïve and stupid, hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table  or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are. incidentally, though this film went straight to cable in the u.s. there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped, so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world.

saw this as part of the dc reel affirmations film festival. i hope they got better movies than this, because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing james franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from my own private idaho to terminator 2, this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience. after the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. i could be upset that i paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours i'll never get back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hours i'll never get back. this would have been a classic mystery science 3000 episode.

a quick, funny coming-of-age matinée romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all. it functions, in effect, as a vehicle for justin long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth die hard via pc vs mac ads, dodgeball and the break up. he's funny, earnest and young - a big career ahead.a town's worth of college wannabes find a fake website bartelby (long) has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the 'college' like it were a short notice facebook party. lewis black summises the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in dean - long's delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship (adam herschman deserves special mention for his never-flagging slapstick contribution). well executed, feelgood and instantly forgettable. 4/10

the most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in ice-t's acting. the story-line; two rival gangs having to fight it out, with the sub-plots of betrayal, power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful(very) to wade through. the decrepit scenery, which added slight believability in places, and questionable lighting, constantly distracted from any interest/identification with the characters (the shine off of the actress's forehead/nose was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) not even half way into the film i wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen. a disappointment if you have seen ice-t in other roles. kudos to other actors/actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; corrupt's side kick and the other restaurant worker.

i wasn't so impressed with this film, finding it quite tiresome and plain. the plot line was interesting, a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids, but the laughs were few and far between. the jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes. the characters weren't intriguing and i didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group. it was a good first watch, but it didn't blow me away and its not one that i would recommend. comparing it to other films in the same genre, ie, american pie is just cruel, because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty. this accepted failed to raise a smile!

inane, awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college. truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to. after viewing this junk, you will see why.what a ridiculous name- south hampton institute of technology. you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense. problem with these type of films is that in the end, the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode.let's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is- excessive manipulative junk!

i see absolutely nothing funny---even remotely funny---in this stupid movie. an unrealistic, silly, ridiculous idea--just completely ridiculous. hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted to any college. even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down. the actors portrayed characters straight out of characterville. we have seen their lot many a time over in many films. nothing new here. i found it on late night tv, and since there was really nothing else on, i watched the whole boring, stupid film. what a total waste. maybe if you are a teenager, you may find it amusing. films are made for an immature mind, so teens, go for it. the rest, no way.

let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie. i only sat through it because i was trying to kill some time before going to work.basically, it's your typical sophomoric "comedy" aimed at the teenage set. there's nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story, not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a carnival cruise-liner through. obviously this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie, it's supposed to be funny. sadly, it mostly fails on that count as well. i must admit that i laughed a few times, but mainly in a "holy sh*t, i can't believe how stupid this is" kind of way.if you never see this movie you're not missing a thing.

seriously, i don't understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular. he either has the best agent in hollywood, or recently sold his soul to satan. he is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing. the only film that he has attempted to anchor that i've remotely enjoyed was waiting... and that is almost solely because i've worked in a restaurant. but i digress. aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits. i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the pg-13 rating certainly won't allow. the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim). his one liners were funny on occasion, but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. if you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you'd enjoy this, but i can't recommend it at all.

this movie was downright awful. most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite, and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews. the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow, but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects. all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question. all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill only he possesses. then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school. of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some "inspirational" speech. this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues.

synopsis: kid is not accepted into any colleges. he creates a "college" where he and his friends can party by using their parent's tuition money. wow. a paean to ignorance. if you believe that we're all ok, man, then this movie is for you. furthermore, you must understand that:1. kids have it all inside them--they just need to let it out.2. teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with. 3. someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony, as long as you take away those restrictive rules. 5. extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. 6. if the board of education allows you to open a "charter school" with "nontraditional teaching techniques," it's because they have your best interests at heart. (not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways.) this movie is one in the college comedy genre, i.e. animal house. it follows the pattern pretty closely. what's new here though, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. it's missing the sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life. this lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of blockbuster. it is so one sided, that i wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre--for about one minute. the movie has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. it's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally. and what is natural is what the name of the school is: s***. (never thought i'd say this: go see something with will farrell instead. his comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)

the most accurate description of how billy crystal fairs in "my giant" is to say that this movie is to his career as "ishtar" was to warren beaty's - it didn't ruin it, but it slowed it down.......a lot. crystal should know the three golden rules of hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you, is as innocent as a kid and "acts" like an animal.what is this story? a comedy? i guess, but i didn't laugh, except at the scenes where crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned giant. did i mention there's also a kid in this film? well, forget about him. the son is brought in to make us feel sorry for crystal, and we do, but for the actor, not the character. billy crystal is a funny man. if you don't believe me, watch him in old episodes of "soap" or "saturday night live." go rent "city slicker" or "running scared" or "when harry met sally.""giant" is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.

this is one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen. and this supposed to be funny..... boring, boring, boring. find the fast forward button at your remote and use it... i can`t say i laughed once, and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended.

i'm still laughing- not! i'm still asking my myself what the point was. i barely got a chuckle, this movie sucks. it tries to be charming and touching, but it turns out stupid. i do not recommend it.

i'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to killa season, from the b grade to the hollywood. but this movie was something different. i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well the acting wasn't to good, compared to silkk the shockers performance in hot boyz (quite good) and ice-t in new jack and svu (great). the scene where corrupt (ice-t) kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice-t and the other dude, this kills the jamaican, however ice-t is unharmed, very similar to ice's other movie urban menace (which stars both of these actors) were snoops character is supernatural, however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon. when mj (silkk) gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-with out blood. and when mj confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird, benny isn't introduced in this movie and the scene isn't in the film. it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes u scratch your head. wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn't mention what happen 2 other main characters mj and lisa. the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide-was a good part of the film, even though the clip of the projects was re-used thousands of times. and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him. the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team. it was ok tho. but me being from poverty i love hood films, however if u don't love em like i do don't watch it. only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars, and my love of the genre.nathaniel purez

i saw this movie a while ago and i was looking forward to it. my biggest problem was having seen the trailer i was expecting a very stylish marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way. i was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching (if what you are expecting is as described above). my girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst i continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen... nothing did. i found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. i would say just don't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care about losing.

since this show was changed from tss (the screen savers) to aots (attack of the show)it has gone down hill. tss with yoshi and kevin rose alex... etc. made the show awesome, then they got fired from tss for an unknown reason. when the show switched to aots, it became less about computers, and more about gaming and magazines. it also promoted bands that nobody had heard of, or cared about. finally i couldn't watch it anymore once kevin rose left. he kept it interesting, but he went off to do his own thing, which is good. kevin rose now has several online pod casts, and shows, etc on the rev 3 network. check it out. rev3.com i think, you can get to it by going to www.systm.org. if you want a real tech show rather than aots, then go watch kevin roses shows or listen to the twit podcast.j<

this show is what happened to the screen savers after g4 got its hands on it, taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone's posterior.as g4's ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, gamers, to generic hormone-driven young men, adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment. now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust. i look forward to the show's, and the network's, overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise.

as a flagship show, attack of the show (aots) is endemic of the larger fall of g4 tv; it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults. its predecessor, the screen savers, was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology. it was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to together.the acquisition of techtv by g4 bothered some longtime fans of the station, but early returns were actually promising. the emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and i really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of e3 and other big entertainment events.unfortunately, aots now stands as but a shell of its former self. those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men. the result is that aots spends as much time parading olivia munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games. it is so bad it is practically unwatchable.while some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing, those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went. equally troubling, young gamers who might tune into g4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience. on a channel like hbo or cinemax, things like that are expected. on g4, it's tragic.at least spiketv, another male-aimed channel, has good programming like csi. aots, and g4, has very little good left to offer.too bad, really.

this meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting, even with ed mcmahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy. jim brown kicks ass effectively, gloria hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles, and brock peters is decent as the cop who plays by the book. it's still dull and badly constructed, and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original james brown score.

seriously, i can't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie, much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. how many methamphetamines was bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie? was he giving a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought? the dialogue is bad, the plot atrocious, even for a "screwball" comedy, and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing i've ever heard. the cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made-for-tv movies, the acting is awful (although i get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director), and speaking of which, did i mention the direction is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? the whole thing is a terribly unfunny (even in the much-beleaguered world of so-bad-it's-funny clunkers), soul-sucking, waste of two hours of your life that you'll never get back. be afraid, be very afraid...

i'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake i started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't. the motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister-excuse me while i barf. the main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in. if the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (dexter played by dennis quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime. there is a reason for where the sex scene is at. early in the movie dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with meg ryan. i still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers.one of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight, a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet nobody at the carnival notices!!! also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on. if you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar, but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits. i would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but i don't want to put a spoiler in my post.

great story and great lead actors (quaid and ryan) but the movie suffers from bad directing,bad screenplay and bad script.the lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all.too bad because this could have been a good 80's style hitchcock suspense/mystery/thriller.ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though.an ok look for big ryan fans.....

rudolph maté's film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's, dexter cornell(dennis quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage. the initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original. dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live, decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students sydney fuller(meg ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their way.the film begins promisingly in black and white, as dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own, but the huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad, its only a question of how bad? sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium, but now the film resorts to full technicolor. there are some brief homages to noir, as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind, but there's really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are awful, ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. the film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise, obviously trying to cash in one the body heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure, they are welcome to it. 4/10

danger: watch for falling spoilers...boy, was this a bad movie. i know that they were going for a "true love conquers all" kind of thing, but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which i will never get back. the movie is about two young lovers named kai and gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world. kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by gerta's father. at first gerta ignores kai's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (you guessed it!) gerta's father. as if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in kai's eye and he becomes a mean person treats gerta poorly. kai is eventually taken to the snow queen's fortress (which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice, because the good people at hallmark like to go all out) and gerta sets out on a mission to get kai back. along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way, but gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (all the while you will want to turn it off, but can't force yourself to do it. it's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen) anyways, i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. so, in conclusion, the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie, which takes the fan out of fantasy.

"the snow queen" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen, about a girl, gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen. this adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design, but fails on a number of counts.like so many hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction. the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable; bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. there's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three-hour miniseries. at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.that said, "the snow queen" would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. it's great eye-candy without being scary, and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very, very bold text. just make sure you read them andersen's story too.

sometimes hallmark can get it right - like the 10th kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod, and this falls into the latter category. the version i saw may have been cut (a demon [?] shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing.possible spoilers if you are unfamiliar with the original fairy tale:anyway, the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th century (?), and makes gerda and kay (here called kai - being a lexx fan, i kept expecting him to say, `the dead do not solve puzzles') 18 year olds. hans christian andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye, goes bad, is taken off by the snow queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and gerda goes to find him, having various adventures on the way.as the two main characters are older than in the original, a lot of time is spent getting them together and `in love'. unfortunately, i was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enough in love to make sense of gerda's quest. by the time the main plot kicks in, the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl. alas, when gerda begins her search for kai, it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll.there are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. at the start of the film the snow queen kills gerda's mother, but no explanation for this is given. a polar bear living in the snow queen's palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear's feelings towards the snow queen would be ok in a fairy tale, but not in a modern film). again, this is never explained. also, hints that the snow queen has an erotic desire for kai are dropped, but never followed through. the script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the `fairy tale' mood.the production looks good, though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the snow queen's palace is the hotel where gerda and kai lived covered in ice. the three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: kai comes across as bland as does gerda initially, but once she sets off to find kai you warm to her. bridget fonda looks great as the snow queen, but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.ultimately, the film is unsatisfying. it looks good, but drags and lacks magic.

this 3-hour made-for-tv miniseries came home with us from blockbuster's this weekend. the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costuming (bridget fonda, especially), and special effects (including a great jim henson talking polar bear & reindeer). they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script. the story line was so loose that it really never came together. one can overlook irish-accented germans, but not herky-jerky storytelling. with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil, this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic. a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads.

for all intents and purposes, showtime was the worst movie i have ever seen.why? because having deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. i had also made the mistake of watching 48 hours and beverly hills cop recently before seeing showtime and for some strange reason thought eddie murphy was still funny. well he's not. in fact it almost seems like he has been neutered. as i watched this movie i was in amazement that deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too. no chemistry between him and murphy whatsoever. horrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you think is supposed to be good can't get much worse than this. not too long after sitting through the wretch that was showtime i happened to watch national security starring martin lawrence. the movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great. but still it was 20 times better than showtime. please if your a deniro fan do not watch this movie!!

i don't understand jokes. i do believe this is my problem with modern cinema, or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation. isn't it odd  people just don't laugh as much anymore, and i do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film "showtime". there was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all of the bantering between murphy and de niro, with russo as eye candy, with even standard clichés which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh. there weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film. from the beginning, i didn't buy the match-up of de niro and murphy as anything more than hollywood excitement, throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot  where was it in the film? this falls to either two problems  the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. either way, they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the hollywood nightmare "showtime".outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film. there was a glimpse of humor with de niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write kiln on the machine so audiences would understand  who does that?), but that was dropped and never developed. there was the idea that murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, nobody would have understood that. he rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary? this just didn't compute even for hollywood standards. there was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there any true test of the weapons capability  even at the end. it became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. where was the television show in this? russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. there was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble. random characters were introduced, forgotten, re-introduced, and forgotten all over again. the director and producer laughed at this, while we, the meager viewer, must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes.was there a love interest in this film? was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to robert de niro? was there random chaos throughout this film? if you need the answers to these, obviously, you won't find them in "showtime". the fact that i am riddling this review with question upon question, only means that this sub-par (actually, well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world. sure, it had big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing of substance to this at all. it was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés  go with the bad ones. the plot had no linear structure. the jokes were boring. the characters were drab and underdeveloped. this ranks below even the best of "buddy-cop" films. i like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. not even shatner could save this film, and he even tried hard.overall, i cannot, nor will i, suggest this film to anyone with a pulse. the commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrid jokes, and creators questioning the validity of their work. if creators can't stand behind "showtime", why should we? i didn't want a "lethal weapon" when i watched this, but i did want something like that. i understand there was some form of criticism of "reality television" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message didn't make it off the page. in fact, i believe i saw "media" leave the theater first when i watched this. shame carries its heavy hand with this film and i cannot blame it. murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "coming to america"), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. de niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further. one of these films is equal to one scorsese picture.skip this one. i promise, it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile. oh, and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  i am truly sorry! grade: * out of *****

bubbling just beneath the surface of showtime is a good idea. actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime. this film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.detective mitch preston (robert de niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash-actor named trey sellars (eddie murphy). when preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by chase renzi (rene russo). in the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.de niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how tv cops don't act like real cops. funny thing is, as the movie progresses, his character and murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with. in a smarter movie, de niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here, it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is. while a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny, the team of writers and director tom dey (who made the far superior shanghai noon a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing, and instead of slamming the tv industry, they really let them off light (the harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work). russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm. with little on screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes. for instance; if showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize de niro and murphy when they are on the job? for that matter, if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy vargas is being televised, why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? then again, given this villain's actions maybe i shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then dispatches him how? by using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house, of course! that's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. occasionally, showtime gets laughs, but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time. even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something, if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script. murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and de niro looks flat out bored through most of this. after a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (that remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) russo's character shouts `that's great television!' perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.

lowe returns to the nest after, yet another, failed relationship, to find he's been assigned to jury duty. it's in the plans to, somehow, get out of it, when he realizes the defendant is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade.through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl (played by camp), lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear camp of attempted murder, while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time, and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same time.i've heard that st augustine is the oldest city in the us, and i also know it has some ties to ponce de leon, so the backdrop is a good place to start. unfortunately, it's the only thing good about this movie. the local police are inept, the judge is an idiot, and the defense counsel does everything in her power to make herself look like joanie cunningham! i don't know whether to blame the director for poor direction, or for just letting the cast put in such a hapless effort.in short, this movie was so boring, i could not even sleep through it! 1 out of 10 stars!

eddy murphy and robert de niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy. great expectationa often lead to dissapointment, and this proves to be the case.when eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by detective robert, they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality tv cop show. logic is not a great component of this movie. the super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it. a twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is as more a fantasy than science fiction. a five pound gun, firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past.it is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children, so if you are somewhere in between, this is the movie for you.

minor plot spoilers ahead!!!how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreadeddrivel? robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standardviolence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls hiseyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and eddie murphy plays anot so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out,"freeze, police!" and has his "tough look" down pat). naturally, theyare partnered when bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot waterwith the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a"cops"-like reality show. take a breath, cuz that's as funny as itgets.no energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread ofevery copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with "15 minutes" starring,yes, deniro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. the jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to behaving a good time. it's dead on the screen.please don't waste your time. even if you have an overwheming affinityfor one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. becauze if thismakes money, these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptablefor actors of their quality.and to mr. deniro. you used to make serious films. i remember them -they were good. you were nominated for awards for them - remember howmuch fun that was? now after "analyze this" (which was good), "meet theparents" (which was also good), and "the adventures of rocky andbullwinkle" (which was not good), i think we need to see you parodyingyourself less, and being yourself more. "casino" feels like a long timeago. and no, i don't count "15 minutes" as serious bobby. anyone whotook that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news

there comes a time in every big name actor's career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldn't have touched with a 1000 ft. pole in their golden days. remember "taxi driver"? that was a fine film. i can hardly believe that the de niro of "showtime" is the same actor.i would rather watch "time chasers" twice than see this film again. if anyone offers to take you to see "showtime" or gives you free passes, or whatever, run away as fast and far as you can.

the movie is not as funny as the director's preceding (and only other) movie, shanghai noon. showtime did have its moments, but it did not satisfy me. why it needed to be so foulmouthed, i don't know, but i give showtime **/****

with all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie, this movie left me wanting. i expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of murphy, de niro and russo but found that the movie fell flat on it's face. comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially de niro and russo couldn't save this one!** out of *****

two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor. although they share the most screen time together, they do not reach their expected performances such films like analyse this, meet the parents, dr doolittle and nutty professor. the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing.it feels like especially de niro doesn't enjoy being in showtime. thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think. unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie. well, i don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and murpy again. ** out of *****

'take fame' and 'you've got served' and roughly jam them together and what do you got? this god awful movie custom made for dull-normal adolescents. the plot very closely follows 'you've got served.' three ghetto afro-teeners, this time living in john water's baltimorenot far from 'peckers' homespend their time getting failing grades in high school and dancing in dilapidated 100-year-old buildings with hoochy-mamas. to finance their expensive baggy hip-hop clothing tastes, they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop shopnot unlike john (tony manaro) travolta who worked in a brooklyn paint store so he could purchase his polyester disco clothes.tyler gage, one of the black three musketeers, gets caught trashing the local fame high school and is forced to perform janitorial duties. he meets nora clark, a 26-year-old white high school student and discovers he's irish-american, much to the chagrin of his black buddies mac and skinny.as in 'you've got served' crime doesn't pay and skinny, the youngest member of the trio gets shot by a bad bad leroy brown typebut that doesn't stop the musicand heart-stopping finale.

the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. channing tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... ever.the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from you got served and save the last dance (i'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).and the dancing... there were only 3 dance sequences in the entire movie and 2 of them were taken straight from the commercial. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer, but maybe thats what needs to be heard. channing tatum is not by any means a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or any wow factor, all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. all of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls, but nothing more. the grande finale left me thinking "... ok, now they're gonna get serious" all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen.i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie, but step up is no exception to the rule. you got served, with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect. save the last dance was garbage, and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years (although i was impressed with moulin rouge)... look to center stage for ballet, look to beat street for hip-hop

i wasn't really interested in seeing step up, but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to see this film, especially since she is so in love with channing tatum, i tease her constantly about it saying how that's the only reason why she loved the movie. but she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing, that if i loved movies like dirty dancing, take the lead, and save the last dance, that i should love step up, eh, what the heck? i guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view.well, you know those movies i just mentioned up top? dirty dancing, take the lead, and save the last dance? well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have. not to mention if you've seen those movies, well, frankly, you have seen step up. because channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? after all, this is their chance to "step up" to the passion, the mystery, and the lust of the dance! ok, that was a silly plot explanation, but like i said, as long as you've seen those movies i mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. i don't understand how it actually has a 5.5 rating, i bet it's those channing lovers! lol! i'm kidding with you guys, but it's all good, i guess i just didn't get what others did with the passion, the mystery that is the dance! oh, antonio bandares, where are you when we need you?! 4/10

step up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. the film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. a jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. the acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. none the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. there were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. this is a class b+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. the scenery was good and the characters held true to life. it is worth the watch if you like that kind of film.

going into the movie with the right expectations, i somewhat liked this movie. like most reviewers who have seen this movie, i fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. but, the dancing sequences were very well done, and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which i enjoy watching). the music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the "drama" scenes more bearable. the leads (jenna dewan and channing tatum) were ok as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.all in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is much much much better than "you got served" in terms of the plot and drama. then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =p

teenage exorcist is one of those god-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. her sister and brother-in-law, along with an irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. well, not much here in way of horror or suspense. in fact, one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect. mike(the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her(the name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens) up after trying to chainsaw her sister. he removes a gag from her mouth and says something like, "this won't be the last gag we see tonight." indeed, it was not. the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal. some of the lines and situations are funny. robert quarry, old count yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an irish priest. he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs. you know you are in trouble, however, when eddie deezen gets top billing. deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well, but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler. michael berryman, from the hills have eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film. as for the other thespians, well, they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and french-cut panties, but beyond that don't expect too much more from her. her sister is played by elena sahagun, and she shows a bit more than brinke(a very lovely young lady by the way) and out acts brinke by miles. her husband, played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. again, not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on. if you are a robert quarry fan, watch it for his performance at the very least.

as i watched this movie, i felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. the acting was horribly stifling, and it was bad acting. the most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. i felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. i was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. all around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse. let's get real here. this is an awful movie.

this movie was horrible and corny. james agee is rolling in his grave.this movie was nothing at all like the book and made a mockery of it. no one should see this movie unless they want to gag.

watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. other than that i can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.the thing that really got me was eddie murphy's character. i can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but i can't think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield. i mean, can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. he's undercover and murphy is part of his backup. so what does the showboating murphy do, he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action. so deniro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series. so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniro's case with all the tv cameras around.eddie murphy's a funny guy, i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies, but he's done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has. i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.

writer-director patrice leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite a-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. it's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. "teach me how to be likable", art dealer françois coste (daniel auteuil) tells a random stranger (dany boon), and that about sums it up. we learn next to nothing about friendship, and daniel auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. just as we hope the travesty is over, leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. like françois's treasured greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. leconte's only asset is julie gayet in the part of coste's business partner catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut.

don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one. it is, but that, does not a good film, make.comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. sadly, this poorly executed film has neither. leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (les bronzes series being another example).the comedic timing is terrible. some jokes are telegraphed. some are re-hashed from other movies. others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh. the plot has messy subplots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian co-owner) and just does not develop or envelope the viewer. it isn't funny and it isn't believable for a second.compare this to any comedy by billy wilder (some like it hot, a foreign afair, etc.) or by leconte's compatriot, francis veber, a true genius at french comedy (le diner de cons, le placard, les comperes, la chevre, la grande blonde, etc.) and you'll see the difference in their tight scripts, great comedic acting and timing, with each joke leading to the next one.watching mon meilleur ami twice would be cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.

i have always wanted to see the movie because i loved the novel, but was warned away because i'd heard that the movie was a stinker. it is. fowles wrote the script and i could follow it fine, despite the fact that i read the novel over thirty years ago.the soundtrack is execrable--jarring, jangling, and utterly inappropriate--breaking any attempt at mystery or mood in the movie. i suspect that the director must take a lot of the blame as even michael caine is terrible in it and he was already doing excellent work in alfie a couple of years earlier.the "mysteries" evoked by the book are not well-translated onto the screen. i'd love to see someone remake this one.

i loved the gorgeous greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. i cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why australian allison turned into french anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. the mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. i saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since i had read the book several times. i recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies i like) who was mostly amazed at how young michael caine and candace bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery.

since the magus is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. set on a "remote greek island," it stars a very uptight michael caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man anthony quinn and his daffy girlfriend candice bergen. quinn, looking like pablo picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but caine looks like he's ready to explode. bergen, although stunning, should not put on a british accent ever. she's not very good at that type of thing. guy green's direction is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. a real sour note is the casting of the effervescent anna karina in the completely joyless role of caine's girlfriend. after seeing her in the likes of a woman is a woman and a band apart, her presence here is quite jarring.

what an utter disappointment. forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead. what on earth were they doing making the american president relatively sane? all the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (peter cook is good as the british pm). it lacks the biting satire of the original, going instead for "lowest common denominator" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if i'm being generous! this is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people.

i don't care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! it combines the bleak seriousness of threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the western and eastern blocs at the time. you gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of "duck and cover" or "protect and survive"!imagine someone made a movie based on the dead kennedys track 'kinky sex makes the world go round', and you're pretty close to whoops! apocalypse. add rik mayall on top form as an insanely ott sas commander and you've got it exactly. a worthy companion piece to dr strangelove, and that's saying something.

this film wasn't good at all. i was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content i was forced to watch. it's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (gabrielle union) dies. the film stars billy dee williams as gabrielle's union's brother. well, actually, gabrielle union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was billy dee williams older sister. this had to be billy dee william's worst performance in his career, ever. he looked as if he didn't remember his lines in a few scenes. he was an unlikable, hardly ever empathetic character, who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well. the two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman (lucy) was trying to connect with him, his other daughter didn't want anything to do with him. billy dee's character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from paris for his sister's funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork. why they had to fool him? because he didn't like attending funerals. i know. you're asking, "but he didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral too?" yes! he claims he didn't like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects. he didn't want anything to do with that. now we're suppose to empathize with that a**hole? the rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. the director and editor didn't care to consider the pacing of the film. the flashbacks were painful to watch. it was a bad film. however, it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals; a film that glorifies african-americans dependence on caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with, even if it is a healthy relationship. when lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals, it makes me question the judgment of black people on film. in these same festivals, the only films that win awards are educational films about african american culture and black films directed by caucasian directors. i'm not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color. the problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views, which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses. these films are often one-sided forms of didacticism. these films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around. the writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. these films always slant the argument. what i am saying is, are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content, which to me means directing, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about african american culture? are we suppose to expect a film like constellation to have a shot in the world against films like "million dollar baby" and "sideways?" what happened to film being entertaining? when i mean entertainment, i mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. why can't these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching? why can't these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest, telling the truth? "i believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity, to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being. we have only one responsibility: to tell the truth."--robert mckee. now that's something i totally agree with. these same black film festivals put down "hustle and flo" as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks. however, it's an honest film about a pimp with a dream. a pimp can't dream? i recall the last time i saw a real pimp he was a human being. and aren't they, pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large, not just in the black community but all over? the powers that be in "black hollywood" believe that films like this are making afro-americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others don't know that there are pimps in the hood. the truth is, until african american people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. this film was awful. the best thing was the cinematography and zoe.

this movie is absolutely horrible! i thought because it had good actors in it like gabrielle union, hill harper, and of course the infamous billy d. williams. the movie is long, and drags on with a documentary style of showing gabrielle union, who has died in the movie, talking about her family; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who, and who's related to who. i would not recommend this movie to anyone, and i wish i could take it back where i got it from. i fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom. do not waste your time or money on this movie. it could had been more true to life with more drama, and less boredom.

i'm going to be generous here and give it a 3 only because i live in huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. that said, this movie was pretty bad. it's like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it. and billy d. williams looked like he'd rather be anywhere but in this movie. it's just a mess. i think i could write a script better than the dislodge for this film, and i'm no writer.there is one thing i've seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boards--everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around world war 2 and actually it seemed more like it was supposed to start out in the late 1950's/early 1960's. while the military was not segregated by then, i'm pretty sure that any troops waiting to board a train would still be segregated in a place like huntsville, al. if the beginning of film was supposed to be the 1940's, then billy d, lesley ann & rae dawn would have to have been in the 70's and 80's instead of their mid 50's or early 60's.don't waste your time unless you really, really like the actors because the story isn't very interesting.

i put down this vehicle from robert de niro and eddie murphy, and murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again, recently, i can see that it does have some very funny bits.this is by no means to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time, but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre? what director, tom dey, has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media. early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks: "how is this different from cops?", when chase renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with de niro's character, mitch preston (hilariously boring name by the way). that's when i saw it in a new light that i hadn't previously noticed.the idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them. de niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of. you can say that de niro is actually playing himself asking: "why would i do another movie playing a cop?" chase renzi is portrayed to be a hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again, she is merely doing it to save her job. she somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that. one line says it all: "who doesn't want to be on tv?" maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film, merely set to entertain, but it does give it a little spin that i hadn't noticed before.as for murphy. you got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with. murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting.the plot with the gun is of course pretty boring. the action sequences are nothing special, except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. one thing that i noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. george michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin.so, i trashed it the first time around but what the heck; if you are gonna do this, why not point out how ridiculous it really is and de niro and murphy took a big chance doing this.

i's a big struggle. as a story that is surreal, this movie could've been great (as great as it is rated by some here), but mixed with the acting (director and relatives playing major roles, due to financial reasons i reckon) found in here ... although calling this acting, is not only a stretch of that word, it's giving it a new meaning! a whole new meaning! if you are into surreal movies (there are some that i do like actually, see the japanese strange circus for example), you might be able to overlook the flaws (see above) and enjoy this more. there are great ideas here, after all! many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while watching this (with a group of friends) almost all of us, just couldn't stop laughing ... not the intention of the director of course! again, everyone has their own liking, as one can see by the high rating of this movie, but i could only recommend the movie if you're aware of the work that alejandro jodorowsky has done and/or are a fan of his!

such pain! pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea, but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. i wouldn't say this straight-to-video south african/canadian/uk horror flick is awful, but its just too bland, predictable and there's just very little memorable about it. it's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. i tried watching it last night, but had to finish it during the morning, as i couldn't keep my eyes open. even then i couldn't remember where i got up to, which left me watching it from the beginning again. the only thing that hit a chord was andreas poulsson's sharp cinematography of the vast, harsh and eerie desert locations. a nice glossy chic creates a striking visual sense, which can't save the film from that overall empty feeling. everything else is below-par and almost comes off grating. like the head-scratching revelation of the beast. huh. the computer-generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable, and there are some grisly flashes of stripped flesh and bones. but there's too little, as there's no hiding the fact that the clichéd script wants to ponder on the generic character conflict to build tension and uncertainty. that would be fine if the wilted script was more than just basic, shallow fluff, because it never generated any strong, lasting suspense, but makes it uninterestingly labour on. the lead characters are superficial and the token support fall in the dispensable basket. it's your stereotypical bunch. scott bairstow and warrick grier's performances are colourless, and the beautiful rachel shelley tries but looks rather weary.

i think the "bone snatcher" should go after anyone associated with this movie. watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. the plot is boring and stupid. there were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. if you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end, you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. i bought this movie based on some other reviews i'd read. i wish i had my money back. what a skunker. if you're looking for a horror movie that will hold your interest, watch "u turn". it may be based on a kooky plot, but it's full of those creepy scenes that keep you jumping from beginning to end.

i watched "deadly voyage" because david suchet was in it, after enjoying him in the "poirot" series. and joss ackland is always worth watching, so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film. alas, it was not to be.i won't bother critiquing the performances, the pacing, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on those elements. the only thing i want to address is the film's message, since it proclaims in the intro that it's based upon a true story, and therein hangs the film's supposed importance."deadly voyage" primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us, because he believes that he can make money there. nothing more, nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish. (of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family, but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in ghana, so he really just created his own problem.) to that end, kingsley decides to stow-away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york. in the process of doing this, he faces harsh conditions, racist crew members and other challenges.but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic. why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley? simply because he has a goal? goals aren't such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say, the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government. it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company. if he makes it to the us, it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into. and if he gets caught, the shipping company will be fined $45,000. i doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else; they're clearly just out for their own gain. he could've spent the $1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for legal passage to the us, and applied for residency and a work permit. instead, he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route.so since kingsley's voyage is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his ordeal? simply because he faces challenges? why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without stowaways? because he's black and the shipping company is white? the reason seems to be because danny glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to root for kingsley, as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage. but once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all, you can't really care about him.before anyone plays the race card, i assure you that i would've felt the same no matter what ethnicity/nationality the involved parties were. imagine if a british person decided to stow-away in a train headed for bhutan, sneak across the border, and collect "unwanted" buddhist antiquities, to bring back to britain to sell. how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? very little, i'd bet. so why should we feel different for kingley? because he's black? because he's poor by american standards? the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means, and that a shipping company being fined $45,000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country. i didn't buy it for a minute.

never ever take a film just for its good looking title.although it all starts well, the film suffers the same imperfections you see in b-films. its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film, so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious.a film to be listed on top of the garbage list.

four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly, it stars carly pope (of "popular" fame), who is always a pleasure to watch. secdonly, it features brilliant new zealand actress rena owen. thirdly, it is filmed in association with the new zealand film commission. fourthly, a friend recommended it to me. however, i was utterly disappointed. the whole storyline is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. pope's acting is fine, but owen is unfortunately under-used. the other actors and actresses are all okay, but i am unfamiliar with them all. aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and pope and owen), this film isn't very good. so the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to.

zipperface is the kind of experience one waits an entire lifetime to avoid! mansour pormand ranks as one of the worst film directors of all time! if, however, you love bad films, see this at all costs!

the first thing you should know about "zipperface" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar "home-video-ish" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a "real" film. and "zipperface" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a "real" serial-killer thriller. it's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre. dona adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the role - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. plus, she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end. the red herrings appear ludicrous at first, but ultimately they work - i guessed the killer incorrectly. and you have to wonder if perhaps tarantino had seen the zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of "the gimp" for "pulp fiction".

wow! this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on cinemax for all those insomniacs (lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie) terrible acting, the killer is quite far from scary, i've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier. lot's of unnecessary 'skin' in this film, pseudo-porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million, a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film. i could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this. i don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone...

creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. people often assume that it was john carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clichés - the italians did it first. movies like eyeball, torso and blood and black lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. there were also a couple of american pre-halloween slashers that warrant a mention. classroom massacre, keep my grave open and savage weekend clearly pre-date 1978, whilst the town that dreaded sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favourites would have to be: my bloody valentine's maniacal miner, the prowler's sadistic soldier and wicked games' copper-faced assassin. i'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category. the final scene in the house on sorority row has to be listed as one of the best and the clown of midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen's costumes.a leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion, which of course doesn't exactly make for a scary disguise. but in later years both blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. here's how the later of the two fared the screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens, as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation. it seems that a stressed-out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so he's decided to hold his wife and kid at gunpoint. detective shine (david clover) manages to wrestle with the gunman, but unluckily for him he looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the end of the road for the grey haired officer. fortunately he is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from lisa ryder (donna adams), the california police department's hottest female law-enforcer.her heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion to detective first class, and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts. meanwhile a leather-clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. ryder and shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called michael walker (john mandell). lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal police regulation doesn't seem to apply to her, so before long she's dating the cameraman even though he's suspect numero uno. when the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the s & m madman if anything, zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its rein. what started as a great stepping-stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction, zero suspense or shocks and talentless mediocre actors. the boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their lack of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes. unfortunately, by this point in the cycle titles like rush week, deadly dreams and the majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature's characters ended up. in an early grave.donna adams doesn't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour - which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might ever expect it to be. mansour pourmand couldn't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. i searched and searched, but found nothing here of merit or note.on the plus side, if you manage to keep the tv turned on until the end then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity. to be honest though, i doubt that by that time you'll even care. and another plus point? well, erm.... the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon?? aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy zipperface. bad bad bad and not in a good way, this is 90 minutes of my life that i could have spent more constructively by plucking my chest-hair. abysmal.

heftig og begeistret (intense and enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in berlevåg in the very northern part of norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.the most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. the people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings. they are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the way of living required. throughout the movie, we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs, some events in a church and on the harbour, and in the end, a trip to murmansk.the outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the norwegian nature. the scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet. thei r livingrooms, the bathroom, the kettle on the oven; there is nothing artificial about this movie, not the people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. everything is as real as can be.it all loses out though when it comes to giving a story. it is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? is it because of the songs? is it because of the nature? or is it simply just to see a story about berlevåg mens-choir, about their life and some of the trips they have. the message, if there is any, is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir. the choir have kept the people together for many many years.it is all nice, but being as popular as it has been, seen by almost 200.000 in norway, there is something wrong. there is no beginning or end to it. nobody gains or loses anything, nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great. why was this movie made?i am sorry. it is a nice movie about good people, but compared to the average european, scandinavian or norwegian movie - this does not deserve a 9 out of 10. it is closer to 4 out of 10, and that is what i will give it.if you see this movie in a theater, you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 55-60. it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters. maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the imdb: it is a movie about elders, for elders. it is a movie of "i regret nothing in my life", and a story saying that living in a small town like berlevåg, might be a nice life too.

i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and the mad monster is one of the movies in the set.i am sure that george zucco was a good actor; but, this was only the second film in which i saw him, the first being dead men walk, in which he played two parts. however, even good acting couldn't save the mad monster.zucco plays a mad scientist, dr. cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). he believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another.in this case, like so many others of its ilk, it is a transfusion of (i assume) wolf's blood into humans. his goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. the subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this snail-paced classic to almost a full-stop. beyond his experiments, dr. cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him, using his transformed gardener. however, he loses control of his subject, who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes! the werewolf transformations are classic hollywood stop-action / makeup effects. no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time; but, in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this.

a paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. so the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. island of dr moreau, frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time. like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against fooling around with mother nature. it doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of frankenstein, but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway. the acting is passable, as is the cinematography, and the film moves along at an entertaining clip. some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous, but hey... it's just a movie - and a b minus one at that. there are also a few nice shots of a wolf, and a smattering of humor tossed-in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.

this has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap i have ever watched. it makes mel brooks movies oscar-worthy by comparison. jim vanbebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as any form of entertainment.while some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as "the texas chainsaw massacre" or "night of the living dead", the production value is not in question. it is vanbebber's ability to cast and present a plausible story line. the casting is deplorable. for the role of charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. never mind that this actor's hair came halfway down his back, (manson's never went much past his shoulders) this actor spoke in a dreadful monotone without so much as a fraction of the personality that steve railsback or even jeremy davies lent to their portrayals of manson. the actor chosen to play "tex" watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the manson case knows. he looks like a minnesota farmer on "little house on the prairie" the actress playing susan atkins has a butt wider than oprah's, while those familiar with the family members know that "clem" was considered somewhat retarded, the actor portraying him did so in such a campy, chaplinesque way it was like watching an old vaudevile act. instead of sharon tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like bloated, alcoholic trailer trash. vanbebber speeds up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasn't proved remotely useful since "the munsters". the end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we aren't sure who they are sometimes.facts are destroyed in this movie as well. "lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, steven parent was shot four times, not twice, abagail folger did not have her throat slit, where were mary brunner and bruce davis during the himnan murder? patricia krenwinkel never sported a "dorothy hamill" hair style.the most baffling aspect of this movie is what the modern day "freaks" had to do with this movie? why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached? what was their problem with the journalist? what was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? why were they included, period? the viewer never knows! holy mackerel, i could go on and on but space prevents it. don't try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say "what the f---?"

i heard legends about this "film" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when i finally got the dvd with it, i impatiently started watching it. by the end, i *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.this may be the worst film i've even "touched" - and i used to be associated with troma for a while. "manson family" makes the bottom of troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork. i could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a "plot" it has, the revoltingly bad "acting", the painful, inept "directing", the sets and props with their "dollar ninety nine" look (i especially "loved" the plastic toy guns used in the tate murder scene!) or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage (i think it was supposed to represent a drug-induced hallucination; i have absolutely no idea how a drug-induced hallucination looks or feels, nor do i want to find out - but i guess drug junkies with burned out "brains" will love this "film" (they seem to be the ones who made it) i've seen many films from various "worst 50" lists, traditionally opened by eddie wood's ones - and eddie wood would be appalled by the sheer ineptitude and talentless of van webber (or whatever his name is; i certainly don't want to remember it) i've never seen "superbabies" or its sequel, but i strongly wish that "manson" joined them on imdb's rating. fortunately, this obscure garbage probably won't be seen by enough viewers to warrant it sufficiently many "1" votes - and so much the better!

i got encouraged to watch this film because i've heard good word of it: it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone, disturbing, shocking... all that jazz. well, i am disturbed because i spent money on it, and i am shocked that something so god-awful actually got released. that's about it.this is a supposed "new look" at charles manson's family of insane loser junkies and their murders. but if this is a "new look" then it's probably "new" as in "fresh and totally inept": just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be.i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is, it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all. there was something about a "manson tape" delivered to a radio dj (or a tv producer?), then an hour of pointless random footage of "the family" in '69, then the polanski murders (looking like a bad school play) and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley (i kid you not), and then it ended (thank god) (don't ask me to make any sense of that, i'm just recalling what i saw!) the performances were terrible, too. and how difficult is it to make a convincing "manson"? get a short skinny scrawny bloke, put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him. there's your manson. but this "manson" doesn't even look right. he just looks like, uh, a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black.or maybe that's what this film is actually about: manson's family didn't make any sense, so this film doesn't make any sense, either. it's symbolic! (yeah, right) i'm still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. stay away from it, it's not even worth renting.ps. the recent us tv production "helter skelter" got bad reviews here but i saw it last month (i saw the 1976 original too) and let me tell you, compared to "manson family", that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless. and i was disappointed in it! that's how bad "manson family" is: it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect.

the only thing of interest about this movie is its subject matter. taking a look at the manson "family" from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea. however, trying to make sense of the uncomprehensible is something that can really only be accomplished in a masterwork -- and this ain't it.presumably because there was so much information to squeeze into a screenplay, this film was done in a faux documentary style, with reenactments thrown in. trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings. it's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.all in all, this movie is one big wasted opportunity. the one ray of sunshine is the acting of marc pitman, who plays tex, who in real life did most of the actual killing. whereas the female characters come off as giggly airheads in the 60s flashbacks, pitman manages to convey real feeling.in short, don't bother with this movie.

okay, last night, august 18th, 2004, i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr. van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival. here's what i have to say about it. first of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger, roman polanski, oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i've ever seen. second of all, in a short q & a session after the show mr. van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (van bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news (and i'm assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). so i had second dibs on questions, i asked if he was trying to present the outsider, mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting "f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! all those other movies are bullsh**!"well anyway, i didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film, "you've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the manson family." excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in god's name can he tell the story for them!? this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard! the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen. this film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events (which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today) into some sort of slasher/comic book/porno/rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.the film was definitely very impressive to look at. the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie's work with the family off of his lie album. the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie (or maybe it was linda) declares at the end, "you can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc." case in point. even the disclaimer "based on a true story" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.all i can say is this, when the film ended i got a free beer so i'm glad i went, but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question. peace.

strikes me as routine, as far as tv movies go. i can believe that it's based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills.for instance, good old john ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her ill, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately. fourteen years pass before the story picks up again. why fourteen years? i would guess that though the narrative doesn't demand it, history does.some of the particular scenes, however, are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer. pawing through her attic, helgenberger, ritter's first wife, stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with stings on the score -- suddenly she recalls when, fourteen years ago, she discovered ritter shaving selenium filings from a rectifier, carefully collecting them, and putting them in her shampoo and her eyelash liner (or whatever it's called). later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well.frankly, i don't believe it. i don't believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that ritter put selenium shavings into her shampoo or eyeliner. selenium is referred to in the movie as a "toxic metal" and i suppose it is, in sufficient quantity, but it's also an anti-oxidant that's sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed. someone will have to demonstrate -- as no one does in this movie -- that it is a topical poison. many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed. so how come some selenium in her shampoo gives marg helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches? and her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup? i think the anthropologist e. b. tylor called this simple-minded idea "sympathetic magic," but i'm not sure.mais je divage. anyway ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later, although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms. wife number two is taken to mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return. circumstantial evidence piles up against ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops out -- when his first trial is dismissed he smirks at helgenberger, who has prompted the investigation.you see, helgenberger was good friends with ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner. (i'll bet.) and she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in ritter's marital schedule. (sure.) the best performance is given by the guy who plays detective mauser -- lawrence dane? everyone else acts by the numbers. they project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. but dane does little things that are original. "i'm told you want to report a murder. (long pause while he sits down and waits), then abruptly thrusts his face towards helgeberger and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice, "so who was murdered"? i suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events, nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life. i mean, what the heck, ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and helgenberger's character is dead, so who is to object? i wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer. ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals -- let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine, and maybe something else -- that i was confused by it all. not that i was rooting for ritter. here's a mathematician with a ph.d. who insists people call him "doctor." he even corrects people who address him merely as "professor." most ph.d.s get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly. "jes' call me whitey, even though i know how to get a standard deviation and you don't." average tv fare.
