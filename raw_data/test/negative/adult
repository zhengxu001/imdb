"haaaarrrryyy!" the amplified, dispassionate female voice could have been leona helmseley in heat but, no, it belongs to allison hayes as nancy archer, the 50-foot woman of the title. in the most infamous role of her film career, allison's performance literally rips off the roof. in fact, make that a couple of roofs.jaw-droppingly tacky, "aot50fw" is the tale of nancy, a neurotic, boozy heiress and her loveless lothario husband, harry (william hudson, who also co-starred opposite the amazing colossal man). nancy has a close encounter of the third kind, in the desert, with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals, and who has a thing for nancy's jewelry. what he does to her once he's carried her off is probably best left a mystery, but soon nancy starts to grow.treading into the center of town on tranquilizers, tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets, the buxom giantess heads toward the low-rent saloon where harry is having a few laughs with a floozy named honey (yvette vickers). the confrontation turns ugly.the poverty row f/x make the alien giant and nancy appear to be transparent due to incompetently transposed images. you'll understand why director nathan juran changed his name to nathan hertz on the credits. juran was no stranger to directing giant creatures, human and non, having also directed "the deadly mantis," "the 7th voyage of sinbad," "jack, the giant killer" plus several episodes of tv's "world of giants" and "land of the giants." a lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons.

i know a lot of people like this show and i apologise to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created. sure i'm sure i would be a big fan of this show if jeremy clarkson wasn't on it. i mean i think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a aeroplane is awesome! but jeremy clarkson is just pathetic. here are the reasons i hate this man: . he thinks it's cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours. . he clearly thinks that he is better than richard hammond and james may. . he's got my best friend saying pathetic things. . he screams at kids just for taking a picture of him. i'm sorry top gear but jeremy clarkson is a freak.

the films of the science fiction channel ( sci-fi channel ) have become boringly predictable. the seem low on budget, originality, and plot.in this creation the government is out to get a bunch of telekinetics and recruits a poor soul by devious means to help. there is plenty of over worked recycled twists on evil government organization theme. black coats, shadows, short meaningless lines make these one dimensional cartoons.daniel dae kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. he brings a bit of the style of his "angel" character to the role. it is hard to miss the link that his "crusade" character was a telepath and this is a film on telekinetics. was this a sci-fi casting move to try and draw fans from the other show? who knows. thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch.the movie is definitely low budget. it reflects the sci-fi channels current model of canadian location, few well known characters, few effects, and woefully terrible plot and character development. one would think they believe science fiction fans will view anything labeled "scifi."if you want a good telekinesis movie, check out "the fury" ( 1978).

if it weren't for the editing out of curse words and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger, it would be easy to mistake this low-budget snoozer for a sci-fi channel pilot. the plot about the government's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics it originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously enough with the hero, himself gifted, in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge. alas, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. top-billed louis gossett, jr. has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. he walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered. other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little.

this movie is the very worst that i have ever seen. you might think that you have seen some bad movies in your time, but if you haven't seen this one you don't know how terrible a movie can be. but wait, there's worse news! the studio will soon rerelease this masterpiece (i'm being ironic) for all to see! the only things worse than the plot of this movie are the effects, the acting, the direction, and the production. bill rebane, the poor man's ed wood (not that there is a rich man's ed wood) (i like ed wood's movies, though) manages to keep things moving at a snail's pace throughout this film. it opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot (a littlefoot? --sorry, couldn't help it) by a pair of unlikable hunters, who are killed by the parent. this causes the entire town where the hunters lived to go on a bigfoot hunting jihad. this is pretty much it for the plot. nothing even remotely interesting happens, and we the viewers are never able to care about any of the characters. if one is interested in the films of rebane i would recommend almost any other over this. however, as i said, it will soon be rereleased by troma in order to bore a new generation of filmgoers.

as jennifer denuccio used to say on square pegs, "gag me out the door." i would definitely vote this movie on imdb's worst movie list.dennis christopher plays t.t., a guy from chicago who goes to california peddling his brother's jazz records. he is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. but he acts more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). there are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. that of duke (seymour cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to get t.t. to act like a normal human being, the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends, and the guy who makes a bet with another that he can live in car for sixth months.california dreaming is just a big old mess. it starts out like a typical seventies romp, complete with bad 70s music (even though this movie came out one year shy of the 80s). and dennis christopher comes off as the most irritable loser, it makes the movie hard to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). even if this movie was supposed to be about the surfer culture, the surf scenes are almost total garbage. the people at the surf contest look as though they can't keep from falling asleep.i guess the only cool thing is seeing tanya roberts outside of her role as midge on the sitcom "that's 70s show." and cassell wasn't bad, he was just in a bad movie.

seymour cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. his acting as supposed washed up beach stud duke slusarski will always have a place in my heart. the film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother's dreams. what he gets is lame surf hijinks. guys cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of la on a friday night. duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman. next time my woman talks back i will pretend i'm spiking the ball. back to seymour cassel. the end of the movie turns into a good drama, since the first half of the film really had no point. duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball, the best he's played in over ten years. the way the scene is shot is beautiful. you can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach. those five minutes will go down as one of my favorites of all time. 3/10 bad to fair, the rest of the movie was lame.

two little girls strike a friendship. one tries to convince the other she's a witch. the other is a pushover who bends to the would be witch's will. on and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls, with many a dramatic cut away as they pose "shocking" questions. you know, the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask, such as, "how do you make a deal with the devil"? oooh... creepy.in the end, the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend. her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. but by the time it comes, you won't care in the least.i can imagine this film may have been frightening to a very religious 1960s mexican moviegoer, but it doesn't even hold up as a charming relic. it merely drags on. it is boring. it is pointless. it is not to be watched.there are many here who have a lot of good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other works and, of course, that common denominator everyone says about pointless films: "ah, the cinematography is wonderful!" those reviewers probably have a point. but for the ones who found this movie with no prior knowledge, who don't care about its "photography," its "atmosphere" or its...whatever else it has -- for these viewers, then, who just want a *good* movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourselves a favour, folks: skip it.

as i sit and think about poison for the fairies, i realize that i may not being fair with the film. my rating of 3/10 may have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value. based on the plot description, reviews on imdb, and the 7.6 imdb rating, i would sure that i had stumbled on a little known gem. sadly, it just didn't do much for me. for whatever reason, poison for the fairies all but put me to sleep.poison for the fairies is the story of two young girls in 1965 mexico city. one of the girls, veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, veronica, is a witch. the other girl, flavia, is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her. that's really about it. in reality, nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate flavia. one commenter on imdb described it as "the scariest film in 80's mexican cinema". my comment  if that's the case, there must not have been many horror films made in mexico in the 80s. another commenter wrote, "watch it if you wanna get scared." my comment  are you sure we're talking about the same movie? my opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples i've given. to me, it was dull, uninspired, and poorly acted. the scene framing is especially annoying as director carlos enrique taboada doesn't ever show the faces of any of the other characters. veronica and flavia carry-on long, drawn-out conversations with members of their families and their teacher, but we never actually see these peoples' faces. it's an annoying gimmick.

the mad monster starts in dr. lorenzo cameron's (george zucco) laboratory as he perfects his discovery of how to turn a human being into a vicious wolf like monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject who happens to be his dim-witted servant petro (glenn strange), apparently he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! however, first things first as dr. cameron has his sights set on some sweet revenge on the people who dismissed his experiments, forced him to resign & subjected him to public ridicule. dr. cameron puts his plan into action & uses his monstrous creation to murder professor blaine (robert strange), in an unfortunate turn of events dr. cameron is unable to control the beast & is spotted by a local farmer jed harper (eddie holden) who spreads the news like wildfire, in another unfortunate coincidence a reporter named tom gregory (johnny downs) gets wind of the story & starts to investigate, he starts to suspect dr. cameron & since gregory is going out with his daughter lenora (ann nagel) he has plenty of opportunity to sniff around...directed by sam newfield this is really low budget stuff from the 40's, even worse it's dull unoriginal low budget stuff. the script by fred myton drags the extremely thin premise out to almost 77 minutes which is far too long, there is no variety in the story & it's basically the same thing over & over. the character's are dull clichés, the mad scientist who conducts pointless experiments that create a monster, the fragile pretty daughter, the reporter who plays the hero & by pure coincidence happens to both be investigating the mysterious deaths said mad scientist is responsible for & is romantically involved with his daughter, the dumb servant, stupid idiotic police & stereotypical shotgun wielding farmers who are always accused of being drunk. this was probably clichéd even back in 1942! the film plods along at a fairly slow pace & director newfield never manages to maintain or generate much in the way of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing. technically the film isn't great, obviously the budget was minuscule & the mad monster itself looks lame resembling an old homeless wino who hasn't shaved for a few weeks & has had a pair of plastic joke shop fangs placed in his mouth. the black and white cinematography is basic & static like most films from this period while the good dr. cameron's laboratory consists of a couch & a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top. the acting is stiff & wooden with petro looking like he's on dope throughout the entire film, zucco as the mad scientist doesn't convince & is forgettable. the mad monster is a pretty lame horror film, there is very little here to entertain although at least i made it through to the end in a single sitting which when i think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself!

not to be confused with the 1943 george zucco movie "the mad ghoul," "the mad monster" is a film that zucco appeared in the year before. in this fairly paint-by-numbers affair, zucco perfects a way to turn his dim-witted handyman, petro, into a wolf/man hybrid by means of wolf's blood injections, and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments. it is a very simple plot, really, and an extremely low-budget production. glenn strange, who plays the man/wolf here, would soon achieve greater fame playing the franky monster in films such as "house of frankenstein" (1944) and "abbott and costello meet frankenstein" (1948). the makeup job on him here is pretty lame, and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth (like the one in 1957's "teenage monster"). the sets in this film, in addition, are fairly nonexistent, and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing. i have given the movie a very generous 4 stars, in part because i have an abiding love for 1940s horror films, but truth to tell, most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap, and i suppose it is. it's certainly no well-crafted universal affair or val lewton masterpiece, that's for sure! still, zucco is always fun to watch, even in undemanding piffle such as this. if you can spare 72 minutes of your life, i suppose you could do worse than "the mad monster" (not too much worse, of course!). oh...one other thing. this dvd is from alpha video, and you know what that means: fuzzy images, lousy sound (indeed, the worst sound of any alpha video dvd i've encountered so far) and no extras. you've been warned!

george zucco was a fine actor, often playing gimlet-eyed villains with a lascivious intensity. however even he couldn't save this dull and flat-footed b flick.zucco plays the usual mad scientist, dr. lorenzo cameron, who believes that wolf's blood, injected into humans, can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win the world war ii (go figure!) experimenting on pedro the handyman(glenn strange) zucco creates a werewolf that looks rather like the ones dave allen used to play in his comedy sketches! pedro is obviously based on lennie from of mice and men, and you almost keep expecting him to say "duh, okay, george!" there's one startling moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching in through the window and grabbing it, but for the most part this is a routine and pedestrian - very pedestrian - 77 minute tread through all the old clichés that are done far better in other movies.we also get the revenge motif from the devil bat worked in, in itself a borrowing from son of frankenstein!zucco is wasted, and you only have to see him in films such as adventures of sherlock holmes, the mummy's hand and dr. renault's secret to see how wasted. a few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer, really. and the scene where zucco demonstrates his wolf-man technique to those who doubted him (again shades of dr. jekyll and mr hyde) is unintentionally hilarious.not one of the better 40s b movies.

for reasons i cannot begin to fathom, dr. lorenzo cameron (george zucco) begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim-witted handyman, petro (glenn strange). the result  petro is transformed into a hideous (as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be) killer beast. dr. cameron uses petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas (and why wouldn't they, dr. cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake).overall, the mad monster is one dull and poorly made poverty row thriller. there's really only one positive i can come up with to write about in the mad monster. george zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone. his dr. cameron is a regular loony. he has no qualms about killing; he has entire conversations with people who aren't there; and, as with most mad scientists, he messes in "god's domain" (actually, i'm not sure anyone accuses him of this, but it fits). but beyond zucco, there's nothing here to recommend. everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad. there are far better examples of poverty row horror from the 1940s than the mad monster.

pretty bad prc cheapie which i rarely bother to watch over again, and it's no wonder -- it's slow and creaky and dull as a butter knife. mad doctor george zucco is at it again, turning a dimwitted farmhand in overalls (glenn strange) into a wolf-man. unfortunately, the makeup is virtually non-existent, consisting only of a beard and dimestore fangs for the most part. if it were not for zucco and strange's presence, along with the cute anne nagel, this would be completely unwatchable. strange, who would go on to play frankenstein's monster for unuiversal in two years, does a lenny impression from "of mice and men", it seems.*1/2 (of four)
